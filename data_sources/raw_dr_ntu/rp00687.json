He\u00a0received a PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, in 2008. Prior to joining NTU in 2013,\u00a0he has been an Invited Research Scientist at the\u00a0Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal, between 2009 and 2010, and a\u00a0Research & Development Scientist at Honeywell Aerospace, USA, between 2010 and 2012. In NTU, he is leading (has led) several research projects including real-time scheduling theory for mixed-criticality systems, model-in-the-loop intelligent framework for smart manufacturing, real-time optimisation for building energy systems, and assured safety architectures for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems. He was a ACM Distinguished Speaker between 2018-2020, a Cluster Director in the Future Mobility Solutions research programme at the Energy Research Institute @ NTU, and a recipient of the Nanyang Education Award (School) in 2020.", "interests": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass systems in which the cyber world of computation and communication closely interacts with the physical world of sensors and actuators. These are highly networked and deeply embedded systems such as those found in modern day aircrafts, automotives, factories, medical devices, smart phones, electric grids, etc. From driver-less cars and air traffic management using sense and avoid, to plug-and-play operating rooms and smart electric grids that integrate traditional and renewable energy sources, intelligent automation of an enormous scale is finding its way into many of these systems.Primary interests of the CPS Research Group @SCSE,NTU are in the design and analysis of safety-critical and time-critical CPS, with a particular focus on cyber-resource management and safety assurance. The current research themes can be broadly classified as follows:Resource Management in IoT and EdgeSafety Assurance in Learning Enabled ComponentsModel-driven Operational Optimization", "grants": "Assured-Safety Architecture for Machine Learning based CPSHolistic Allocation of Edge and Wireless Resources for Time-Sensitive IoT ApplicationsIntelligent Modelling for Decision-making in Critical Urban Systems (DESCARTES)Intelligent Modelling for Decision-making in Critical Urban Systems (DESCARTES): Main Account SCSE (Sub-project 1)Trust to Train and Train to Trust: Agent Training Programs for Safety-Critical Environments (SCSE)", "articles": ["Chwa, H.
