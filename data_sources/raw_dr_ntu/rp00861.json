From 2012 to 2014, he was a research scientist at Temasek Laboratories in National University of Singapore. From December 2014 to April 2015, he was a postdoctoral research fellow in Singapore University of Technology and Design. He joined School of Computer Engineering in Nanyang Technological University as Assistant Professor in May 2015.", "interests": "Dr. LIN\u2019s research interests can be classified into two main categories: theoretical and practical computer science. In the theoretical part, he focuses on formal methods including model checking and theorem proving. Currently, he is working on automatic compositional verification techniques to alleviate the state explosion problem with respect to model checking. In the practical part, he focuses on embedded system design, multi-core embedded software development, and application framework design on cyber physical systems.", "grants": "A security policy verification and validation platform for smart contracts", "articles": ["Y.
