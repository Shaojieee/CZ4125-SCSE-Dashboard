Prior to joining NTU, he was an instructor with responsibility for lab demonstrator, tutor and final year project supervisor at National University of Singapore. Aside from development of several undergraduate course materials and teaching courses on embedded system design, digital electronic, microcontroller programming and engineering mathematics, he has been working on the development of vision based collision avoidance system from unmanned aerial vehicles, text detection and recognition in the wild. His research interests focus on computer vision, image processing, machine learning, and embedded computer vision system. He is currently a Lecturer with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Concurrently, he is also appointed as CSC Part-time Programme Coordinator. He is a member of IEEE.", "interests": "Computer Vision, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Embedded Vision System", "grants": "Project Plan For NSCC-NTU Student Supercomputing Competition And Event Support", "articles": ["Y.R.
