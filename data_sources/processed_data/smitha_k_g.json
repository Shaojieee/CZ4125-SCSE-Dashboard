Due to multipath fading, single terminal detection is unreliable and results in a high probability of missed detection. This is solved by applying cooperative detection. However, when the number of SUs is large, the bandwidth for reporting their sensing results to the common receiver will be very huge. In this paper, we propose an improved frequency divisional cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing based on the location information which employs a censoring method to reduce the average number of sensing bits sent to the common receiver.

By employing polyphase DFT filter bank prior to spectrum sensing, the sampling rate can be reduced by M (the number of subbands).

In this paper we propose a reconfigurable architecture for adaptive modulation. The proposed architecture uses the highest modulation scheme, when input is of high quality, giving the system more capacity. During a signal fade, the system can shift to a lower modulation scheme to maintain the connection quality and stability. The proposed architecture can be reconfigured for various quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) modulations and it is an area and power efficient scheme compared to conventional adaptive modulation scheme which uses a velcro approach of realizing all the modulations in parallel.", "Frequency spectrum sharing between licensed primary users (PUs) and unlicensed secondary users (SUs) requires the SUs to reliably detect the spectrum occupancy. Due to multipath fading, single terminal detection is unreliable and results in a high probability of missed detection. This is solved by applying cooperative detection. However, when the number of SUs is large, the bandwidth for reporting their sensing results to the common receiver will be very huge. In this paper, we propose an improved frequency divisional cluster based cooperative spectrum sensing based on the location information which employs a censoring method to decrease the average number of sensing bits to the cluster head.", "In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable low complexity non-uniform filter bank architecture based on the fast filter bank design for channelization in military radio receivers. The proposed method is able to reconfigure the filter bank architecture so as to adapt to non-uniform bandwidth channels of military radio signals. The flexibility in realizing multiple bandwidth channels is achieved by suitably designing the prototype filter and efficiently selecting the channels using the information from the spectrum detection unit. A nonuniform bandwidth filter bank is shown as the design example and the complexity comparison shows that our method is 58% less complex than the best known non-uniform discrete Fourier transform filter bank.", "The complexity of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters is mainly dominated by the number of adders (subtractors) used to implement the coefficient multipliers. It is well known that Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) method based on Canonic Signed Digit (CSD) representation considerably reduces the number of adders in coefficient multipliers. Recently, a binary-based CSE (BSE) technique was proposed, which produced better reduction of adders compared to the CSD-based CSE. In this paper, we propose a new 4-bit binary representation-based CSE (BCSE-4) method which employs 4-bit Common Subexpressions (CSs) for implementing higher order low-power FIR filters. The proposed BCSE-4 offers better reduction of adders by eliminating the redundant 4-bit CSs that exist in the binary representation of filter coefficients.

This ability of CRs makes them a feasible choice to achieve green radio networks. CRs perform spectrum sensing, wherein presence and/or absence of licensed users' signals is detected in the wideband input frequency range in order to allow opportunistic access of the vacant frequency bands to unlicensed users.
