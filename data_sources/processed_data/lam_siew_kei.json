However, research on crack detection is still limited and pixel-level automatic crack detection remains a challenging problem, due to heterogeneous pixel intensity, complex crack topology, poor illumination condition, and noisy texture background. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically detecting pavement cracks at pixel level, leveraging on multi-scale neighborhood information, and pixel intensity. Using pixel intensity information, a probabilistic generative model (PGM) based method is developed to calculate the probability of a crack for each pixel. This produces a probability map consisting of the probability of each pixel being part of the crack. We demonstrate that the neighborhoods of each pixel contain critical information for crack detection, and propose a support vector machine (SVM) based\u00a0\u2026", "Recent breakthrough in wireless energy transfer technology has enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to operate with zero-downtime through the use of mobile energy chargers (MCs), that periodically replenish the energy supply of the sensor nodes. Due to the limited battery capacity of the MCs, a significant number of MCs and charging depots are required to guarantee perpetual operations in large scale networks. Existing methods for reducing the number of MCs and charging depots treat the charging tour planning and depot positioning problems separately even though they are inter-dependent. This paper is the first to jointly consider charging tour planning and MC depot positioning for large-scale WSNs. The proposed method solves the problem through the following three stages: charging tour planning, candidate depot identification and reduction, and depot deployment and charging tour assignment\u00a0\u2026", "Accurate travel-time prediction of public transport is essential for reliable journey planning in urban transportation systems. However, existing studies on bus travel-/arrival-time prediction often focus only on improving the prediction accuracy of a single bus trip. This is inadequate in modern public transportation systems, where a bus journey usually consists of multiple bus trips. In this paper, we investigate the problem of travel-time prediction for bus journeys that takes into account a passenger's riding time on multiple bus trips, and also his/her waiting time at transfer points (interchange stations or bus stops). A novel framework is proposed to separately predict the riding and waiting time of a given journey from multiple datasets (i.e., historical bus trajectories, bus route, and road network), and combining the results to form the final travel-time prediction. We empirically determine the impact factors of bus riding times\u00a0\u2026", "Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for collision avoidance in autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, predicting a pedestrian's trajectory in crowded environments is non-trivial as it is influenced by other pedestrians' motion and static structures that are present in the scene. Such human-human and human-space interactions lead to non-linearities in the trajectories. In this paper, we present a new spatio-temporal graph based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting pedestrian trajectory in crowded environments, which takes into account the interaction with static (physical objects) and dynamic (other pedestrians) elements in the scene. Our results are based on two widely-used datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in human trajectory prediction. In particular, our method leads to a reduction in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) of up to 55% and 61% respectively over state-of-the-art approaches.", "Hardware/software (HW/SW) partitioning is a crucial step in HW/SW codesign that determines which components of the system are implemented on hardware and which ones on software. It has been proved that the HW/SW partitioning problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we present two approaches for HW/SW partitioning that aims to minimize the hardware cost while taking into account software and communication constraints. The first is a heuristic approach that treats the HW/SW partitioning problem as an extended 0\u20131 knapsack problem. In the second approach, tabu search is used to further improve the solution obtained from the proposed heuristic algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform a recently reported work by up to 28\u00a0%.", "In this paper, we address the problem of travel time prediction of bus journeys which consist of bus riding times (may involve multiple bus services) and also the waiting times at transfer points. We propose a novel method called Traffic Pattern centric Segment Coalescing Framework (TP-SCF) that relies on learned disparate patterns of traffic conditions across different bus line segments for bus journey travel time prediction. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a training and a prediction stage. In the training stage, the bus lines are partitioned into bus line segments and the common travel time patterns of segments from different bus lines are explored using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Bus line segments with similar patterns are classified into the same cluster. The clusters are then coalesced in order to extract data records for model training and bus journey time prediction.

In this paper, a novel architecture for the BCVC (Between Class Variance Computation) of Otsu's method is presented to meet these high-speed requirements. The proposed implementation employs a binary Logarithmic Conversion Unit (LCU) to eliminate the complex divisions and multiplications in the Otsu's procedure. Implementations on the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform show that our method achieves a computation speed-up of about 2.75 times by occupying only 1/6/sup th/ of the FPGA slices required by one that relies on the direct implementation.", "Pedestrian detection plays an important role in many applications such as autonomous driving. We propose a method that explores semantic segmentation results as self-attention cues to significantly improve the pedestrian detection performance. Specifically, a multi-task network is designed to jointly learn semantic segmentation and pedestrian detection from image datasets with weak box-wise annotations. The semantic segmentation feature maps are concatenated with corresponding convolution features maps to provide more discriminative features for pedestrian detection and pedestrian classification. By jointly learning segmentation and detection, our proposed pedestrian self-attention mechanism can effectively identify pedestrian regions and suppress backgrounds. In addition, we propose to incorporate semantic attention information from multi-scale layers into deep convolution neural network to boost pedestrian detection. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves the best detection performance with MR of 6.27% on Caltech dataset and obtain competitive performance on CityPersons dataset while maintaining high computational efficiency.", "It has been well recognized that detecting road surface in a realistic environment is a challenging problem that is also computationally intensive. Existing road surface detection methods attempt to fit the road surface into rigid models (e.g., planar, clothoid, or B-Spline), thereby restricting to road surfaces that match specific models. In addition, the curve-fitting strategies employed in such techniques incur high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for in-vehicle deployments. In this paper, we propose an efficient nonparametric road surface detection algorithm that exploits the depth cue. The proposed method relies on four intrinsic road scene attributes observed under stereo geometry and has been shown to reliably detect both planar and nonplanar road surfaces efficiently. Extensive evaluations are performed on three widely used benchmarks (i.e., enpeda, KITTI, and Daimler), encompassing many\u00a0\u2026", "This paper proposes three algorithms for multiple-choice hardware-software partitioning with the objectives of minimizing execution time and power consumption, while meeting area constraint. Firstly, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to rapidly generate an approximate solution. In the second algorithm we refined the approximate solution using a customized tabu search algorithm. Finally, a dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to calculate the exact solution. Simulation results show that the approximate solution is very close to the exact solution. This can be further refined by tabu search to achieve a solution with less than 1.5% error for all cases considered in this paper.", "RISPs (Reconfigurable Instruction Set Processors) are increasingly becoming popular as they can be customized to meet design constraints. However, existing instruction set customization methodologies do not lend well for mapping custom instructions on to commercial FPGA architectures. In this paper, we propose a design exploration framework that provides for rapid identification of a reduced set of profitable custom instructions and their area costs on commercial architectures without the need for time consuming hardware synthesis process. A novel clustering strategy is used to estimate the utilization of the LUT (Look-Up Table) based FPGAs for the chosen custom instructions. Our investigations show that the area costs computations using the proposed hardware estimation technique on 20 custom instructions are shown to be within 8% of those obtained using hardware synthesis. A systematic approach has\u00a0\u2026", "Knowledge of the ego-vehicle's motion state is essential for assessing the collision risk in advanced driver assistance systems or autonomous driving. Vision-based methods for estimating the ego-motion of vehicle, i.e., visual odometry, face a number of challenges in uncontrolled realistic urban environments. Existing solutions fail to achieve a good tradeoff between high accuracy and low computational complexity. In this paper, a framework for ego-motion estimation that integrates runtime-efficient strategies with robust techniques at various core stages in visual odometry is proposed. First, a pruning method is employed to reduce the computational complexity of Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature detection without compromising on the quality of the features. Next, three strategies, i.e., smooth motion constraint, adaptive integration window technique, and automatic tracking failure detection scheme, are introduced\u00a0\u2026", "Videoendoscopy is becoming increasingly popular in surgical procedures. Wide-angle lenses are commonly employed in such applications for enhanced viewing capability. However, images captured with these lenses suffer from barrel distortion. 2D distortion correction for images captured with wide-angle lenses has been widely investigated in clinical applications, it is necessary to incorporate correction techniques that are independent of the distance from the object to the camera lens. In this paper, we prove that for a wide-angle camera lens with fixed focal length, the distortion correction coefficients remain the same for distances within the minimum and maximum range (depth of field). Experiments have also been performed to verify this.", "The increasing demand for urban mobility calls for a robust real-time traffic monitoring system. In this paper we present a vision-based approach for road traffic density estimation which forms the fundamental building block of traffic monitoring systems. Existing techniques based on vehicle counting and tracking suffer from low accuracy due to sensitivity to illumination changes, occlusions, congestions etc. In addition, existing holistic-based methods cannot be implemented in real-time due to high computational complexity. In this paper we propose a block based holistic approach to estimate traffic density which does not rely on pixel based analysis, therefore significantly reducing the computational cost. The proposed method employs variance as a means for detecting the occupancy of vehicles on pre-defined blocks and incorporates a shadow elimination scheme to prevent false positives. In order to take into\u00a0\u2026", "Civil infrastructure (e.g., buildings, roads, underground tunnels) could lose its expected physical and functional conditions after years of operation. Timely and accurate inspection and assessment of such infrastructures are essential to ensure safety and serviceability, e.g., by preventing unsafe working conditions and hazards. Cracks, which are one of the most common distress, can indicate severe structural integrity issues that threaten the safety of the structure and people in the environment. As such, accurate, fast, and automatic detection of cracks on structure surfaces is a major issue for a variety of civil engineering applications. Due to advances in hardware data acquisition systems, significant progress has been made in the automatic detection and quantification of cracks in recent decades. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the research progress and prospects in computer vision frameworks for\u00a0\u2026", "Intelligent vehicles and social robots need to navigate in crowded environments while avoiding collisions with pedestrians. To achieve this, pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential. However, predicting pedestrians' trajectory in crowded environments is nontrivial as human-to-human interactions among the crowd participants influence their motion. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end graph-centric gated learning model to estimate the existence of interactions between individuals. Accordingly, the model predicts pedestrians' future locations and velocities. Recent methods based on LSTM networks used thresholding techniques to define neighborhood boundaries and relationships. Other graph-structured methods grow edges in polynomial size. In contrast, our graph-based GRU network model employs an online data-driven criterion that can learn from interactions and grow connections between pedestrian nodes. The proposed model yields outperforming prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art works in two public datasets, ie Crowds and SDD.", "Network pruning for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has recently achieved notable research progress on image-level classification. However, most existing pruning methods are not catered to or evaluated on semantic segmentation networks. In this paper, we advocate the importance of contextual information during channel pruning for semantic segmentation networks by presenting a novel Context-aware Pruning framework. Concretely, we formulate the embedded contextual information by leveraging the layer-wise channels interdependency via the Context-aware Guiding Module (CAGM) and introduce the Context-aware Guided Sparsification (CAGS) to adaptively identify the informative channels on the cumbersome model by inducing channel-wise sparsity on the scaling factors in batch normalization (BN) layers. The resulting pruned models require significantly lesser operations for inference while maintaining comparable performance to (at times outperforming) the original models. We evaluated our framework on widely-used benchmarks and showed its effectiveness on both large and lightweight models. On Cityscapes dataset, our framework reduces the number of parameters by 32%, 47%, 54%, and 63%, on PSPNet101, PSPNet50, ICNet, and SegNet, respectively, while preserving the performance.", "This paper presents an efficient approach to represent the environment, which can be used to facilitate dynamic path planning in robot navigation systems. The environment is modelled by first defining a 'virtual rectangle' to represent an environment that avoids unwanted obstacles. The obstacles within the environment are then represented as convex polygons to generate the required visibility graph. The devised techniques lend well for hardware porting and thus highly suited to high-speed generation of the visibility graph. It has been demonstrated that efficient dynamic path planning can be realised by generating the 'virtual rectangle' on the fly such that only the environment needed to facilitate onward traversal can be identified. Finally, the proposed algorithms lend well for high-speed computations as they facilitate a high-degree of parallelism at the architecture level.", "Detection of malicious programs using hardware-based features has gained prominence recently. The tamper-resistant hardware metrics prove to be a better security feature than the high-level software metrics, which can be easily obfuscated. Hardware Performance Counters (HPC), which are inbuilt in most of the recent processors, are often the choice of researchers amongst hardware metrics. However, a lack of determinism in their counts, thereby affecting the malware detection rate, minimizes the advantages of HPCs. To overcome this problem, in our work, we propose a three-step methodology for fine-grained malware detection. In the first step, we extract the HPCs of each system call of an unknown program. Later, we make a dimensionality reduction of the fine-grained data to identify the components that have maximum variance. Finally, we use a machine learning based approach to classify the nature of\u00a0\u2026", "Feature matching is a fundamental step in many real-time computer vision applications such as simultaneous localization and mapping, motion analysis, and stereo correspondence. The performance of these applications depends on the distinctiveness of the visual feature descriptors used, and the speed at which they can be extracted from video frames. When combined with standard key-point detectors, the rotation-aware binary robust independent elementary features (rBRIEF) descriptor has been shown to outperform its counterparts. In this paper, we present a deep-pipelined stream processing architecture that is capable of extracting rBRIEF features from high-throughput video frames. To achieve high processing rate and low complexity hardware, the proposed architecture incorporates an enhanced moving summation strategy to calculate the key-points' patch moments and employs approximate computations to\u00a0\u2026", "Intermodality in transportation systems is fast becoming a research topic of great interest. The computation of multiple paths in a multimodal network is desirable to identify efficient routes based on user preferences. This paper describes the clustering technique, which improves the performance of conventional k-shortest paths computations in multimodal transportation networks by first transforming the network into an acyclic representation through identification of cycles and clustering them into hypothetical nodes. The generalized Floyd algorithm is then applied on these clusters to compute the k-shortest paths. Simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly improves the performance of the conventional algorithm, particularly when the required number of k-shortest paths increases.", "Technology scaling into the nano-scale CMOS regime has resulted in increased leakage and roadblock on voltage scaling, which has led to several issues like high power density and elevated on-chip temperature. This consequently aggravates device aging, compromising lifetime reliability of the manycore systems. This paper proposes HiMap, a dynamic hierarchical mapping approach to maximize lifetime reliability of manycore systems while satisfying performance, power, and thermal constraints. HiMap is process variation- and aging-aware. It comprises of two levels: (1) it identifies a region of cores suitable for mapping, and (2) it maps threads in the region and intersperses dark cores for thermal mitigation while considering the current health of the cores. Both the levels strive to reduce aging variance across the chip. We evaluated HiMap for 64-core and 256-core systems. Results demonstrate an improved\u00a0\u2026", "The combination of features from an accelerated segment test (FAST) corners and binary robust independent elementary feature (BRIEF) descriptors provide highly robust image features. We present a novel detector for computing the FAST-BRIEF features from streaming images. To reduce the complexity of the BRIEF descriptor, we employ an optimized adder tree to perform summation by accumulation on streaming pixels for the smoothing operation. Since the window buffer used in existing designs for computing the BRIEF point-pairs are often poorly utilized, we propose an efficient sampling scheme that exploits register reuse to minimize the number of registers. Synthesis results based on 65-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed FAST-BRIEF core achieves over 40% reduction in area-delay product compared to the baseline design. In addition, we show that the proposed architecture can achieve 1.4\u00d7\u00a0\u2026", "Accurately detecting the presence and evolving boundaries of cracks on rock surfaces is critical for understanding the behavior of crack evolutions and facture mechanism of rock and rock-like material, which could cause engineering disasters if proper operation were not taken to deal with the evolving cracks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of vision-based automatic detection of cracks on rock surface at pixel-level, which is a preliminary step of crack evolution analysis. We build a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) system to simulate the crack evolution process and capture the process as video data using a high frame camera, where a dataset of evolving cracks is created consisting of rock crack images that are manually labeled in pixel-level granularity. We propose a two-stage method to detect cracks in video data: the first stage employs Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning\u00a0\u2026", "RowHammer attacks pose a security threat to DRAM chips by causing bit-flips in sensitive memory regions. We propose a technique that combines a sliding window protocol and a dynamic integrity tree to rapidly detect multiple bit-flips caused by RowHammer attacks. Sliding window protocol monitors the frequent accesses made to the same bank in short intervals to identify the vulnerable rows. Dynamic integrity tree relies on SHA-3 Keccak hash function while maintaining the minimal number of vulnerable rows at any particular time to enable detection of bit flips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by performing RowHammer attacks using the prime and probe method with a DDR3 DRAM.

However, the inefficient collision detection algorithms and fault tolerance mechanisms make them time-consuming and their success rate low. Moreover, they may still leave very huge chain spaces that makes it difficult for key recovery. In this article, we exploit collision attack to optimize Template Attack (TA), and propose a Lightweight Collision Detection (LCD) algorithm. The proposed method exploits a jump detection mechanism to efficiently reduce the repetitive collision detections on chains with the same prefix sub-chains.

Their ability to find optimal solutions depends heavily on the parameterization of the pheromone trails. However, the pheromone parameterization mechanisms in existing ACO algorithms have two major shortcomings: 1) pheromone trails are instance-specific; hence they need to be generated for each new problem instance, 2) solution is constructed based on static pheromone trails, which ignores the impact of the evolving decisions on the final solution.

Specifically, semantic information is fused with motion states of the scene via a probability framework to enable accurate and robust moving object extraction in order to retain the useful features for pose estimation and mapping. Our work highlights the importance of distinguishing between motion states of potential moving objects for vSLAM in highly dynamic environments. The proposed method can be integrated into existing vSLAM systems to increase their robustness in dynamic environments without incurring much computation cost.

The challenge lies in generating as few ROIs as possible at low computational complexity, while ensuring none of the pedestrians in the scene are omitted. However, existing ROIs generation methods either result in a large number of irrelevant ROIs or are compute-intensive. In addition, distinguishing pedestrians who are in close proximity is still a big challenge. In this paper, we propose an efficient stereo based ROIs generation method that is based on a two-level incremental segmentation strategy.

There has been an enormous effort in developing a generalised solution to this problem, but a little has been done considering the security of resource constraint embedded devices. In this paper, we attempt to develop a lightweight malware detection tool designed specifically for embedded platforms using micro-architectural side-channel information obtained through Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). The methodology aims to develop a distance metric, called \u03bb, for a given program from a benign set of programs which are expected to execute in the embedded environment. The distance metric is decided based on observations from carefully chosen features, which are tuples of high-level system calls along with low-level HPC events. An ideal \u03bb-value for a malicious program is 1, as opposed to 0 for a benign program. However, in reality, the efficacy of \u03bb to classify a malware largely depends on the proper assignment of weights to the features. We employ a gradient-descent based learning mechanism to determine optimal choices for these weights. We justify through experimental results on an embedded Linux running on an ARM processor that such a side-channel based learning mechanism improves the classification accuracy significantly compared to an ad-hoc selection of the weights, and leads to significantly low false positives and false negatives in all our test cases.", "Timing side-channel attacks pose a major threat to embedded systems due to their ease of accessibility.

To alleviate this, we propose a highly-efficient collision-optimized attack named Collision Tree (CoTree). This collision detection tool exploits tree structure to store the chains created from the same sub-chain on the same branch, thus significantly reducing the storage requirements. It then benefits from the properties of both tree and collisions, and exploits a top-down tree building procedure and traverses each node only once when detecting their collisions with a candidate of the sub-key\u00a0\u2026", "Methods and systems for obfuscating computer program code are disclosed. In an embodiment, a method of generating obfuscated binary code from input source code for execution on a target processor comprises: generating a set of random obfuscation transform selections; and iteratively optimizing the obfuscation transform selections until a termination criterion is met. The obfuscation transformation selections may comprise indications of custom instructions which are executable on the co-processor in order to reduce side channel leakage.", "The performance of Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) decays rapidly when considering more sub-keys, making the full-key recovery a very challenging problem. Limited to independent collision information utilization, collision attacks establish the relationship among sub-keys but do not significantly slow down this trend. To solve it, we first exploit the samples from the previously attacked S-boxes to assist attacks on the targeted S-box under an assumption that similar leakage occurs in program loop or code reuse scenarios. The later considered S-boxes are easier to be recovered since more samples participate in this assist attack, which results in the``snowball''effect. We name this scheme as Snowball, which significantly slows down the attenuation rate of attack performance. We further introduce confusion coefficient into the collision attack to construct collision confusion coefficient, and deduce its relationship with correlation coefficient. Based on this relationship, we give two optimizations on our Snowball exploiting the``values''information and``rankings''information of collision correlation coefficients named Least Deviation from Pearson correlation coefficient (PLD) and Least Deviation from confusion coefficient (CLD). Experiments show that the above optimizations significantly improve the performance of our Snowball.", "A framework for efficiently and automatically exploring a data network and accurately identifying network threats, which comprises a plurality of software and hardware-based agents, distributed over the data network. The agents are capable of adjusting or reconfiguring, on the fly, the behavior of the agents and their ability to collect data in a targeted manner, so as to investigate suspicious incidents and alerts and collect data that was not yet collected by the system; collecting forensic data by executing tasks defined in workflows, being distributed threat intercepting programs and reporting about the collected forensic data, back to a Central Control Unit (C&C). Distributed threat intercepting programs (\u201cworkflows\u201d) are used to provide instructions to agents, to perform branching and provide instructions to the Central Control Unit (C&C), which orchestrates the agents to assure proper execution of the workflows\u00a0\u2026", null, "By introducing collision information into side-channel distinguishers, the existing collision-optimized attacks exploit collision detection algorithm to transform the original candidate space under consideration into a significantly smaller collision chain space, thus achieving more efficient key recovery. However, collision information is detected very repeatedly since collision chains are created from the same sub-chains, ie, with the same candidates on their first several sub-keys. This aggravates when exploiting more collision information. The existing collision detection algorithms try to alleviate this, but the problem is still very serious. In this paper, we propose a highly-efficient detection algorithm named Collision Tree (CoTree) for collision-optimized attacks. CoTree exploits tree structure to store the chains creating from the same sub-chain on the same branch. It then exploits a top-down tree building procedure and traverses each node only once when detecting their collisions with a candidate of the sub-key currently under consideration. Finally, it launches a bottom-up branch removal procedure to remove the chains unsatisfying the collision conditions from the tree after traversing all candidates (within given threshold) of this sub-key, thus avoiding the traversal of the branches satisfying the collision condition. These strategies make our CoTree significantly alleviate the repetitive collision detection, and our experiments verify that it significantly outperforms the existing works.", "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been a major tool in performing characterization of environmental data where in, the data is typically a hyper spectral image. Using statistical methods, PCA is often capable of reducing the dimensionality of data. On the other hand Nonlinear Iterative PArtial Least Squares (NIPALS) algorithm provides an efficient alternative for extracting the principal components with a minimum penalty on processing speed. In this work we provide the hardware implementation of NIPALS algorithm on an FPGA, for extracting principal components of a given dataset. Experimental results of our approach on various hyper spectral images show 92.31% average reduction in dimensionality with 0.1% average loss on information of the dataset. The results obtained from XILINX Artix-7 FPGA implementation show the advantage of the proposed method.

Meeting the real-time requirements is mandatory for VO in such applications. Previous works have primarily focused on improving accuracy at the cost of longer runtime. In this work, we propose novel strategies for feature correspondence setup, outlier removal and robust pose optimization in the VO pipeline to achieve real-time performance of close to 30 frames-per-seconds (fps) on a dual-core 3.5 GHz CPU while maintaining high accuracy. In particular, computationally efficient strategies are introduced to obtain an initial set of good features and rapidly filter out the outliers to minimize the computational overhead in later stages. In addition, we propose a depth based weighting and saturated-residual scheme during pose optimization to increase the robustness of VO. Experimental results show that the proposed VO\u00a0\u2026", "Recovering keys efficiently from far beyond exhaustible candidate spaces is a meaningful but very challenging topic in Side-Channel Attacks (SCA). Recent methods often utilize collision optimizations to reduce the key candidate space so that exhaustive search methods can be feasibly applied for key recovery. However, the current collision optimization methods can only utilize information of a small number of collisions, which limits the number of wrong key candidates that can be removed. In addition, their application is restricted to situations where only small thresholds can be applied. As such, the existing methods are not feasible for recovering the full key if sub-keys and collision values are located in much deeper spaces as we will discuss in this paper. To overcome these problems, we propose Full Collision Attack (FCA). Compared to the existing methods, FCA makes use of all possible collisions between any two sub-keys and removes a larger number of wrong key candidates, thus enabling key recovery in much deeper spaces. Moreover, we find that the collision values that fall beyond the threshold usually occurs only for a few sub-keys. Based on this finding, we propose the Rotational Error Tolerant FCA (RET-FCA) to significantly reduce the candidate space of collisions. Our results show that RET-FCA performs favourably when the collision values fall in the intractable space of FCA.", "Side-channel attacks and evaluations typically utilize leakage models to extract sensitive information from measurements of cryptographic implementations. Efforts to establish a true leakage model is still an active area of research since Kocher proposed Differential Power Analysis (DPA) in 1999. Leakage certification plays an important role in this aspect to address the following question:\" how good is my leakage model?\". However, existing leakage certification methods still need to tolerate assumption error and estimation error of unknown leakage models. There are many probability density distributions satisfying given moment constraints. As such, finding the most unbiased and most reasonable model still remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we address a more fundamental question:\" what's the true leakage model of a chip?\". In particular, we propose Maximum Entropy Distribution (MED) to estimate the leakage model as MED is the most unbiased, objective and theoretically the most reasonable probability density distribution conditioned upon the available information. MED can theoretically use information on arbitrary higher-order moments to infinitely approximate the true leakage model. It well compensates the theory vacancy of model profiling and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for approximating the leakage model using MED estimation.", "In the modern data centers based on virtualization, virtual machine assignment (VMA) is the primary research topic to efficiently schedule the cloud resources. It has been proved that the problem of VMA to minimize the maximum access latency is of NP-hard. Most existing works focus on how to assign the virtual machines to the data nodes, but few works are reported on fault-tolerant techniques that is indispensable for the security and reliability of the data center network. This paper presents fault-tolerant algorithms to minimize the maximum data access latency for the problem of VMA with fault virtual machines. The proposed algorithm searches the clique with controllable redundancy in the set of the available virtual machines, and then it selects the machines from the redundant clique and assigns them for the data nodes of the data center network.

However, existing methods result in large area wastage due to the module size difference and the waste area inside each module. In this paper, we propose an efficient and dynamic module partitioning approach for the library based design flow that minimizes the area wastage. Our proposed approach efficiently utilizes the pre-placement module information such as relative positions of blocks including CLBs, DSPs and RAMs, and the module sizes (width, height) for placing these blocks. We introduce a B*-tree representation to enable a fast modular placement. Simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to direct each round of the placement and to search for the optimization. We develop a set of efficient rules to guide the module selection and partition during placement, to eliminate the\u00a0\u2026", "The development of a fully automated robotic endoscopic steering system has been an active area of research for more than a decade. This paper aims at proposing a hardware-efficient iterative thresholding strategy to locate the lumen region in captured endoscopic images in order to enhance traditional endoscopes with certain degree of autonomy and intelligence. The proposed method is characterized by a definite requirement on the number of iterations of thresholding in order to detect the lumen region. The proposed algorithm has been demonstrated to be robust against varying characteristics using real endoscopic sample images. The reduction in the number of operations required by the proposed method can be up to 71% compared to a previously reported method. FPGA synthesis results of the proposed approach confirm its viability for real-time realization.", "Adaptive and low-complexity corner detection is essential for the realization of modern real-time video processing applications on low-resource embedded platforms. In our earlier work, we have proposed an efficient iterative pruning strategy for widely used Shi-Tomasi and Harris corner detectors.

In comparison to the conventional nonmaximal suppression, applying the proposed strategy results in higher efficiency in computations for the iterative pruning based Shi-Tomasi/Harris corner detectors.

The proposed approach utilizes stable dark regions in iris images for recognition and does not rely on special hardware or on computationally expensive image restoration algorithms. We have employed a Gabor-based model to establish that stable features, which are not sensitive to defocus, correspond to local regions in iris images with low gray-level intensity. We will also present an approach to identify stable bits from the iris code representation, which correspond to dark regions in the enrolled image. Only these stable bits are used for recognition. Experimental results based on 15,000 images with varying degree of defocus show that the proposed method achieves an average recognition performance gain of about 1.45 times over a conventional method that relies on the entire code representation for iris recognition.", "In this paper, we present a novel and computationally efficient pruning technique to speed up the Shi-Tomasi and Harris corner detectors. The proposed technique quickly prunes non-corners and selects a small corner candidate set by approximating the complex corner measure of Shi-Tomasi and Harris. The actual corner measure is then applied only to the reduced candidate set. Experimental results on the NiOS-II platform show that the proposed technique achieves an average execution time savings of 90% for Shi-Tomasi and 70% for Harris detectors for 500 corners with no loss in accuracy.", "Advancement in design tools is necessary to bridge the widening productivity gap between hardware design and software development in state-of-the-art Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).

In this thesis, techniques for the automatic generation of profitable custom instructions for FPGA based Reconfigurable Instruction Set Processors (RISPs) have been proposed. A detailed literature review was undertaken to establish the shortcomings in the existing work on RISPs. In particular, challenges in the selection, hardware estimation, area-time optimization and runtime reconfiguration of custom instructions for FPGA based RISPs have been established. A method for the selection of custom instructions has been proposed and compared with the existing ones reported in the literature. The proposed technique based on Largest-Fit-First (LFF) has been shown to yield large custom instructions that are capable of representing a number of frequently executed ones. It was shown that the outputs generated using LFF can be further refined by considering the overlapping templates that were previously ignored. Performance evaluations show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing methods by up to 32%. Moreover, the proposed selection process can be realized in the order of milliseconds.Techniques for the rapid estimation of critical path delays and area measures of custom instructions implemented on LUT based FPGAs have been devised.

In this paper, area-time measures for fully parallel, serial and pipelined implementations of a well-known BSD addition technique are presented. All three versions were synthesized at gate level using 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS cell-based libraries. Our results show that while the fully parallel method provides the fastest with highest area complexity, both the serial and pipelined approaches facilitate scalable implementations that lend well for area-time optimal solutions in VLSI.", "A new pipelined architecture for adaptive progressive thresholding (APT) is proposed. Unlike the conventional architectures that rely heavily on multipliers and dividers to evaluate the maximum between-class variance, our method employs a reconfigurable logarithmic computing unit to simplify the circuitry and increases the application's ability to handle operational variation. Our logarithmic conversion algorithm avoids large look-up tables by streaming the operand's bits into segments so that several small look-up tables and simple adders and shifters are sufficient to guarantee an accurate result. Besides being cost effective, the proposed architecture has also significantly reduced the latency of the critical pipelined stage.", "One of the major drawbacks of the visibility graph-based environment modelling process is its high computational complexity, particularly when the number of obstacles is large. In this paper, a logarithmic approximation based gradient computation method has been proposed to efficiently identify the farthest front vertices. It has been shown that the half-plane methods can be employed by examining only these farthest front vertices to rapidly identify the links that are obstructed by other objects. Novel techniques have been incorporated to substantially reduce the size of the look-up table required to implement the logarithmic approximation method. VLSI efficient architecture was then developed to demonstrate the viability of incorporating the visibility graph-based approach into a high-speed environment modelling process, which is well suited to dynamic robot navigation.", "Image compression is the reduction of data required to adaptation of this compression algorithm had been devised represent an image to save on storage space and to reduce which would allow for its implementation in hardware. transmission requirements.

However, divide-and-conquer distinguishers used such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) cannot directly provide the success probability of attack which impedes effective threshold setting for determining the candidate space. In particular, they uniformly demarcate the thresholds for all sub-keys, which restricts the candidate space that is able to be analyzed and increases the attack difficulty. Moreover, the existing works mainly focus on improving collision detection algorithms, and lacks theoretical basis. Finally, the inadequate use of collision information and backward faulttolerant mechanism of existing schemes lead to low attack efficiency. To overcome these problems, this work first introduces guessing theory into Template Attack (TA) to facilitate the estimation of success probability and the corresponding complexity of key recovery. We also extend Multiple-Differential Collision Attack (MDCA) to a new combined collision attack named Multiple-Differential Combined Collision Filter (MDCCF), which achieves the multiple-differential voting mechanism via two levels: Distinguisher Voting (DV) and Collision Voting (CV). DV exploits the information from CPA, TA and Correlation enhanced Collision Attack (CCA) to filter the candidates of TA that fall within a threshold. CV further applies differential voting on the selected sub-keys with the smallest number of candidates to vote other sub-keys. The experimental results show that the proposed MDCCF significantly improves key\u00a0\u2026", "Recovering keys efficiently from very deep candidate space is a very important but challenging issue in Side-Channel Attacks (SCA). State-of-the-art combined collision attacks extract specific collisions from the outputs of a divide-and-conquer attack and an analytical attack, thus reducing the large guessing spaces to much smaller collision spaces. However, the inefficient chain detection makes them timeconsuming. The very limited collisions exploited and very different performance of two combined attacks also prevent their application in much deeper spaces. In this paper, we propose a Minkowski Distance enhanced Collision Attack (MDCA) with performance close to Template Attack (TA), thus making their combination more practical and meaningful. Moreover, we build a more advanced combined collision attack named Combined Full Collision Attack (CFCA) from TA and MDCA to fully exploit collisions. We further incorporate guessing theory into CFCA to enable the determination of suitable thresholds and optimize search orders of sub-keys. Finally, to set the thresholds as small as possible while guaranteeing a high success probability of key recovery, we propose Block based Fault-Tolerant CFCA (BFT-CFCA). We further exploit the Fault-Tolerant Vector (FTV) to provide a reference for its chain space adjustment. Experimental results show that BFT-CFCA notably outperforms the existing methods and CFCA.", "Table of contents Page 1 APRIL 2019 VOLUME 27 NUMBER 4 ITCOB4 (ISSN 1063-8210) \nREGULAR PAPERS Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence High-Throughput and Area-Optimized \nArchitecture for rBRIEF Feature Extraction ........................................ ............................................................................................ \nTH Pham, P.
