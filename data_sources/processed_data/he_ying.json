He received his Bachelor and Master degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, Master and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. His research interests fall into the general areas of visual computing and he is particularly interested in the problems which require geometric analysis and computation. He is an Associate Editor of Journal of Computational Visual Media (Springer) and Computer Graphics Forum (Wiley). He regularly serves on the Technical Program Committee for major research conferences in geometric modeling and computer graphics.", "grants": "A 4D Variational Framework for Constructing 3D Self-Supporting SurfacesHolistic Moving Target Defence for Autonomous Driving PerceptionIterative Poisson Surface Reconstruction: A Novel Computational Tool for Constructing Large-scale, Complex 3D Scenes in MetaverseReconstruct 3D Surfaces of Arbitrary Topology Using Unsigned Distance FieldsSmall Dataset Training, Efficient Geodesic Representation", "google_scholar": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ISNmBxwAAAAJ", "orcid": null, "github": null, "scopus": "https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36975461300", "web_of_science": null, "dr_ntu": "https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00503", "other_websites": ["https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yhe"], "interests": ["Geometric modeling", "computer graphics", "3D deep learning"], "bachelor_degree": null, "masters": null, "phd": null, "published_by_year": {"unknown": 32, "2019": 13, "2014": 13, "2009": 4, "2008": 1, "2010": 8, "2016": 13, "2013": 11, "2021": 8, "2011": 15, "2005": 4, "2007": 1, "2015": 5, "2012": 16, "2017": 6, "2006": 2, "2018": 14, "2020": 11, "2023": 14, "2022": 6}, "citations_by_year": {"Year": [2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023], "# of Citations": [4, 25, 27, 31, 38, 44, 73, 89, 131, 180, 205, 166, 168, 177, 182, 213, 215, 285, 268]}, "all_time_h_index": 29, "all_time_i10_index": 93, "h_index_by_publication_year": {"2019": 7, "2014": 8, "2009": 4, "2008": 1, "2010": 8, "2016": 8, "2013": 10, "2021": 5, "2011": 11, "2005": 4, "2007": 1, "2015": 3, "2012": 10, "2017": 5, "2006": 2, "2018": 5, "2020": 5, "2023": 3, "2022": 4}, "h_index_by_year": {"2019": 21, "2020": 24, "2021": 26, "2022": 27, "2023": 29, "2014": 15, "2015": 16, "2016": 18, "2017": 19, "2018": 20, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 12, "2013": 13, "2008": 6, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 4}, "h_index_by_years_from_publication_year": {"Publication Year": [2019, 2014, 2009, 2008, 2010, 2016, 2013, 2021, 2011, 2005, 2007, 2015, 2012, 2017, 2006, 2018, 2020, 2023, 2022], "Year": [2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023], "h-index": [[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [null, null, null, null, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [null, null, null, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [null, null, null, null, null, 1, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 1, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, 3, 5], [null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, 3, 6, 6, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11], [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [null, null, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5], [null, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 1, 4, 5, 5], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 3], [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 1, 4]]}}
