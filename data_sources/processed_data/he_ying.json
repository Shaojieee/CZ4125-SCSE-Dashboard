He received his Bachelor and Master degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, Master and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. His research interests fall into the general areas of visual computing and he is particularly interested in the problems which require geometric analysis and computation. He is an Associate Editor of Journal of Computational Visual Media (Springer) and Computer Graphics Forum (Wiley). He regularly serves on the Technical Program Committee for major research conferences in geometric modeling and computer graphics.", "google_scholar": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ISNmBxwAAAAJ", "orcid": null, "github": null, "scopus": "https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36975461300", "web_of_science": null, "other_websites": ["https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yhe"], "citation_statistics": {"table": {"": ["Citations", "h-index", "i10-index"], "All": ["5299", "41", "126"], "Since 2018": ["2496", "27", "73"]}, "chart": {"2005": 21, "2006": 60, "2007": 53, "2008": 94, "2009": 112, "2010": 140, "2011": 176, "2012": 250, "2013": 270, "2014": 352, "2015": 444, "2016": 378, "2017": 370, "2018": 379, "2019": 383, "2020": 400, "2021": 388, "2022": 484, "2023": 456}}, "interests": ["Geometric modeling", "computer graphics", "3D deep learning"], "num_published": {"unknown": 32, "2019": 13, "2014": 13, "2009": 4, "2008": 1, "2010": 8, "2016": 13, "2013": 11, "2021": 8, "2011": 15, "2005": 4, "2007": 1, "2015": 5, "2012": 16, "2017": 6, "2006": 2, "2018": 14, "2020": 11, "2023": 14, "2022": 6}}
