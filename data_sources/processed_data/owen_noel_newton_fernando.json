["Cuteness in interactive systems is a relatively new development, yet having its roots in the aesthetics of many historical and cultural elements. Symbols of cuteness abound in nature as in the creatures of neotenous proportions; drawing in the care and concern of the parent and the care from a protector. We provide an in depth look at the role of cuteness in interactive systems beginning with a history. We particularly focus on the Japanese culture of Kawaii, which has made a large impact around the world, especially in entertainment, fashion, and animation. We then take the approach of defining cuteness in contemporary popular perception. User studies are presented offering an in-depth understanding of key perceptual elements which are identified as cute. This knowledge provides for the possibility to create a cute filter which can transform inputs and automatically create more cute outputs.

By introducing this technology, we expect people to share their smell and taste experiences with their family and friends remotely. Sharing these senses are immensely beneficial since those are strongly associated with individual memories, emotions, and everyday experiences. As the initial step, we developed a control system, an actuator, which could digitally stimulate the sense of taste remotely. The system uses two approaches to stimulate taste sensations digitally: the electrical and thermal stimulations on tongue. Primary results suggested that sourness and saltiness are the main sensations that could be evoked through this device. Furthermore, this paper focuses on future aspects of such technology for remote smell actuation followed by applications and possibilities for further developments.", "This paper describes a social media system to prevent dengue in Sri Lanka and potentially in the rest of the South and Southeast Asia regions. The system integrates three concepts of public health prevention that have thus far been implemented only in silos. First, the predictive surveillance component uses a computer simulation to forewarn health authorities and the general public about impending disease outbreaks. The civic engagement component allows the general public to use social media tools to interact and engage with health authorities by aiding them in surveillance efforts by reporting symptoms, mosquito bites and breeding sites using smartphone technologies. The health communication component utilizes citizen data gathered from the first two components to disseminate customized health awareness messages to enhance knowledge and increase preventive behaviors among citizens.

Blockchain became popular in various industries due to its decentralized trust ecosystem. When integrating blockchain with big data, one encounters many challenges. Current public blockchain does not support high transaction throughput; it does not scale in terms of big data storage and management; it does not provide keyword-based search and retrieval; and so on. As a result, it is hard to incorporate existing blockchain systems for big data applications. In this research, we propose a new blockchain storage \"Mystiko\" that is built over the Apache Cassandra distributed database to incorporate big data.

In the fast paced modern world people are generally too busy to monitor various significant social or human aspects of their lives, such as time spent with their family, their overall health, state of the ecology, etc. By quantifying such information digitally, information is semantically coupled into living microorganisms, E. coli. Through the use of transformed DNA, the E. coli will then glow or dim according to the data. The core technical innovation of this system is the development of an information system based on a closed-loop control system through which digital input is able to control input fluids to the E. coli, and thereby control the output glow of the E. coli in real time.

Existing dengue monitoring prevention programs are exhausted as public health inspectors (PHIs) cope with increasing workloads and paper-based modes of surveillance and education, characterizing a reactive system unable to cope with the enormity of the problem. On the other hand, the unprecedented proliferation and affordability of mobile phones since 2009 and a supportive political climate have thus far remained unexploited for the use of mobile-based interventions for dengue management. Objective To conduct a needs assessment of PHIs in Colombo with respect to their dengue-related tasks and develop a new mobile-based system to address these needs while strengthening existing systems. Methods One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 PHIs to a) gain a nuanced, in-depth understanding of the current state of surveillance practices, b) understand the logistical, technological and social challenges they confront, and c) identify opportunities for mobile-based interventions. Quantitative analysis included simple descriptive statistics while qualitative analysis comprised textual analysis of 209 pages of transcripts (or nearly 600 minutes of conversations) using grounded theory approaches.

In 2012, nearly 40,000 people were affected by Dengue with reports that the capital city of Colombo was the epicentre from which Dengue was spreading to different parts of the country. While Dengue prevention efforts by public health authorities have witnessed vast improvements over the past 5 years, the magnitude of the problem demands that existing systems be enhanced and strengthened. The unprecedented penetration of mobile phones and profusion of social media in Asia calls for the optimization of such technologies to address this issue.  Objectives 1) To understand the information flow related to Dengue case incidence among the public health authorities in Colombo; 2) To understand gaps in Dengue surveillance and education, and thereby examine informational and technological needs of public health inspectors (PHIs); 3) To obtain feedback from PHIs on the utility of a mobile, social media-based system in development by the team that integrates three components: a) predictive surveillance, b) civic engagement and c) health education.   Methods We conducted a mixed methods cross-sectional study among PHIs in Colombo, Sri Lanka. First, we conducted a 10-minute paper based survey that included demographics, technological self efficacy and information seeking behaviors of PHIs. Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand the information flow (dynamics and challenges of identifying and reporting Dengue cases), educational activities related to Dengue, technology use and preferences, client interaction and\u00a0\u2026", "This study analyzes interaction techniques in previously proposed 16 user interface concepts that utilize the form factor of a finger-ring, i.e. \u201cringterfaces\u201d.

The mnemonics can be created by taking photos of the user's vicinity and by binding them onto command sequences. The mnemonic is triggered every time a similar photo is taken. Our method uses natural feature matching algorithms and end-user programming approaches. The mnemonics can be concatenated into more complex command sequences. Thus, limited user input is realized by just taking photos with a camera embedded into a finger-ring, which enables rapid, subtle and socially acceptable user interaction. Our method can be used as semi-automatic way of achieving location and context sensitive services, activity recognition or tangible interaction.", "Petimo is designed specifically for the use of children in the age group of 7-9yrs and special consideration was given to this factor when designing the physical properties. In Piaget [10] theory of cognitive development, children between the age of 7-12yrs are in the third stage of their cognitive development known as Concrete operations stage where they make the transition from the security and comfort of home to school and friends. Further, John Gottman states that to form successful friendships, children needed to find common-ground activities, communicate clearly, exchange information, resolve conflict and engage in sharing of personal information [5]. In addition, sociocultural theories determined that direct interaction children have with peers and adults have a profound influence in the child development and participating effectively in society [6, 7]. Therefore, Petimo is designed to enhance their experience of building social circles and networking both in the physical and digital world in a secure and healthy environment.After understanding the developmental stage our target user, the key factor taken into consideration during the design process of Petimo robot is the user-friendliness with an interactive interface and natural gestures. The purpose is to give them a tool that encourages them in making friends in both physical and virtual world. The Petimo allows them to move effortlessly between the physical and virtual interactive spaces.

However, despite its nimble and flexible nature, social media has been applied to health issues in silos. By this, we mean that social media affordances have either been applied to addressing specific aspects of a health issue, or have focused on addressing one issue at a time, such as infectious diseases. Given the apparent commonalities in the technological characteristics of social media for health interventions, applying the same features to a distinct set of health issues leads to reinventing the wheel and, more important, redundancy in technological deliverables. This paper addresses this issue by proposing the general architecture of Health Suite, an integrative common platform built on a plug-and-play model for health-related social media solutions. We present summary findings from formative research studies that informed our idea, offer a detailed description of Health Suite and its various modules, and demonstrate how Health Suite\u2019s modules have been adapted for designing a social media-based dengue prevention intervention in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
