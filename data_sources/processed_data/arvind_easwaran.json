He\u00a0received a PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, in 2008. Prior to joining NTU in 2013,\u00a0he has been an Invited Research Scientist at the\u00a0Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal, between 2009 and 2010, and a\u00a0Research & Development Scientist at Honeywell Aerospace, USA, between 2010 and 2012. In NTU, he is leading (has led) several research projects including real-time scheduling theory for mixed-criticality systems, model-in-the-loop intelligent framework for smart manufacturing, real-time optimisation for building energy systems, and assured safety architectures for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems. He was a ACM Distinguished Speaker between 2018-2020, a Cluster Director in the Future Mobility Solutions research programme at the Energy Research Institute @ NTU, and a recipient of the Nanyang Education Award (School) in 2020.", "google_scholar": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B_ouhTgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9628-3847", "github": "https://cps-research-group.github.io/", "scopus": "https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=13409980100", "web_of_science": null, "other_websites": [], "citation_statistics": {"table": {"": ["Citations", "h-index", "i10-index"], "All": ["2846", "28", "72"], "Since 2018": ["1432", "20", "51"]}, "chart": {"2006": 13, "2007": 25, "2008": 29, "2009": 69, "2010": 109, "2011": 138, "2012": 120, "2013": 149, "2014": 177, "2015": 177, "2016": 147, "2017": 185, "2018": 215, "2019": 230, "2020": 205, "2021": 235, "2022": 337, "2023": 207}}, "interests": ["Real-Time Systems", "Cyber-Physical Systems", "Embedded Systems"], "num_published": {"2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2011": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2006": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 13, "2010": 7, "2019": 18, "2012": 5, "2022": 13, "2020": 20, "2021": 10, "2018": 12, "2005": 2, "2004": 1, "2023": 4, "unknown": 20}, "bachelor_degree": null, "masters": null, "phd": "University of Pennsylvania", "h_index_by_publication_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2011": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2006": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2010": 5, "2019": 10, "2012": 4, "2022": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2018": 6, "2005": 1, "2004": 1, "2023": 1}, "h-index_over_time": {"2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 12, "2014": 13, "2015": 16, "2016": 17, "2017": 19, "2018": 21, "2019": 22, "2020": 23, "2021": 24, "2022": 26, "2023": 27, "2006": 3, "2005": 1, "2004": 0}}
