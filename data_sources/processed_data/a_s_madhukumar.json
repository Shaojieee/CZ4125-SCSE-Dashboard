and methods for processing symbol blocks of a spread signal in both frequency and time domains are described. A transmitter (10) of the CDMA system spreads pilot symbols and data of the symbol blocks to derive a spread sequence. Thereafter, the spread sequence is extended with a predetermined number of chips and pulse shaped for transmission as the spread signal. A receiver (400) of the CDMA system receives the spread signal, removes the predetermined number of chips and then orthogonally transforms the spread signal to the frequency domain to derive a transformed signal. The transformed signal is equalized in the frequency domain to derive an equalized signal. The equalized signal is then inverse orthogonally transformed to an output in the time domain. The output is then despreaded to derive the symbol blocks.", "A high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is a major shortcoming in multicarrier systems, as it causes nonlinearity in the transmitter, degrading the performance of the system significantly. Partial transmit sequences (PTS) is one of the best methods in reducing PAPR, in which the information-bearing subcarriers are divided into M disjoint subblocks, each controlled by a phase rotation factor which brings PAPR down. Though PAPR reduction by PTS is more effective with more subblocks, there is a corresponding exponential increase in complexity. In this paper, a novel implementation of PTS is presented, in which a dual-layered approach is employed to reduce the complexity.", "Novel air traffic management (ATM) strategies are proposed through the Next Generation Air Transportation and Single European Sky for ATM Research projects to improve the capacity of the airspace and to meet the demands of the future air traffic.

Free-space optics (FSO) communication, which is the term used for OWC in an outdoor scenario, is a good candidate to establish ground-to-satellite/satellite-to-ground links. Despite of many advantages, FSO communication in uplink is limited by the adverse effects of beam-wander, beam scintillation, and pointing errors.

The short DR of RSNS enables it to be effectively used for error detection without the addition of any redundant modulus as in Redundant Residue Number System. Although RSNS has a large redundant range, its detection ability is not optimal due to the Gray code property associated with it.

Our extensive studies show that the PSD of these signals not only depends on the time dithering code and the modulation schemes, but also on the energy spectral density (ESD) of orthogonal pulses. The different order orthogonal pulses provide different ESD which changes the shape of continuous spectral component with symbols. We show that orthogonal pulse-based signals reduce the dynamic range of amplitude of discrete spectral components. Further, we reduce the dynamic range by adopting longer TH code over orthogonal pulse-based signals. As a result, UWB system performance improves with average transmitted power.

This paper suggests the use of a novel pulse waveform in UWB obtained from the combination of the two higher order derivatives of Gaussian pulse to minimize the interference with other systems. This pulse waveform reduces UWB interference power at the center frequency of narrowband systems based on spectral nulls. These null points can be shifted by changing the time gap between the combined pulses. It is also possible to reduce multi-user interference (MUI) of UWB systems by using the special template signal at the receivers.

The performance has been evaluated for two combining schemes of hybrid auto repeat request (ARQ) namely chase combining and incremental redundancy. The results show that the proposed SR scheme achieves significant improvement in terms of system throughput over the conventional schemes. This effect is more significant for chase combining because the rotated mechanism is more effective when the same packet is transmitted during the retransmission. It is also found that SR scheme is not sensitive to Doppler frequency variation, which makes SR scheme an attractive candidate for fast fading channels.

One way of achieving proper coordination is through the use of feedback channels. An implicit feedback channel available during relaying has been determined to minimize the feedback among cooperating nodes. In addition, it improves the reliability of information decoding at the destination by mitigating erroneous relay transmissions. The present paper studies the outage analysis of a cooperative transmission scheme assisted by the implicit feedback channel.

The trade-off for simplicity is a loss in performance. The pulse-repetition interval (PRI) for non-coherent UWB schemes is limited by the maximum channel delay, to avoid intersymbol interference (ISI). This affects the maximum data rate achievable. For a coherent system, ISI can be mitigated by equalization, which is generally not applicable for non-coherent methods. In a non-coherent energy detector for instance, the square-law device at the receiver destroys the multipath phase information, making complete ISI mitigation impossible.

The resulting power spectral density of UWB systems can become very small due to the very large bandwidth. With such low radiated power, it is important to design a receiver that maximises the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventionally, this is achieved by a pulse matched filter. Due to the high data rate of UWB, pulse matching may not be feasible. Therefore, a template matching approach is employed instead.

However, this results in undesirable side effects in the form of artifacts appearing the correlated outputs. We discuss the effect of quantization on the correlator outputs and we propose two simple methods which reduce artifacts considerably.

For such systems, schemes based on incremental relaying have great potential to improve the spectral efficiency by adapting the transmission to time varying channel conditions. The performance enhancement brought about by the presence of relays in such incremental relaying based cooperative systems is dependent on the level of cooperation (based on the relay information quality) and on coordination among the nodes. Coordination is achieved through the use of feedback channels, which incurs significant bandwidth penalty and brings down the spectral efficiency. In order to mitigate this, one can exploit an implicit feedback channel available due to broadcast nature of relay transmissions. Instead of using dedicated feedback channels, the implicit feedback channel is used to measure the relay information quality. Based on this information, the transmitter (source/relay) for the additional coded (redundancy) bits is determined. Such a mechanism enhances the reliability as it ensures the availability of correct information at the destination node for decoding. This paper studies the impact of such an implicit feedback channel by employing powerful codes which exhibit inherent incremental redundancy features, such as rate-compatible codes (rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes and punctured low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes) and rateless codes (Luby Transform (LT) codes).

This paper proposes a data dependent pilot structure for downlink transmission of SCRIP-CDMA to enhance pilot assisted channel estimation in frequency domain. The pilot symbols are computed by assuming constant envelope in frequency domain. This structure gives an easy method for channel estimation. The performance of the proposed pilot structure is compared with common pilot structure, which is data independent. Extensive computer simulations were conducted for both pilot structures.", "The conventional RAKE receiver employed in CDMA system can not satisfy the desired demand when the propagation channel possesses a considerable number of paths and a deep fading that causes serious inter-user and inter-symbol interferences. This paper proposes a novel means of adaptive equalizer based on QRD-RLS algorithm to substitute the traditional RAKE receiver. Regarding the computational complexity of the RLS, the well-known CORDIC algorithm has been exploited and plays a key role in the hardware implementation of the new approach. The proposed RLS structure is simulated extensively under different channel parameters and performance is compared against conventional RAKE structure.", "This paper presents a new method to improve bandwidth efficiency of RNS based CDMA system by combining RNS representation, PSK/QAM modulation and orthogonal modulation. Using the proposed method significantly reduces the computational complexity of the receiver unit and significantly increases the data transmission rate. The modified system is simulated extensively for different channel conditions and found that it can be used for faster data transmission without affecting the system performance.", "This paper is concerned with a new method to enhance the bandwidth efficiency of an MC-CDMA system by using a residue number based representation for information symbols. The residues are mapped into a set of orthogonal sequences and are transmitted in parallel. To increase the data rate further, a modified residue representation scheme is used with significantly lesser number of orthogonal sequences. A multicarrier modulation scheme is used for both transmission and reception of residue channels. The issues involved in the design of an enhanced RNS based MC-CDMA architecture is discussed and the performance of the system is evaluated in a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel via extensive simulations.", "Research and Development on Third Generation Mobile Communication Systems in \nSingapore (invited) - NASA/ADS Now on home page ads icon ads Enable full ADS view \nNASA/ADS Research and Development on Third Generation Mobile Communication Systems \nin Singapore (invited) Madhukumar, AS ; Chin, F.

Whenever there are several devices in close proximity are connecting to each other, different degrees of cooperation among the devices can result in significant performance gain under cost constraints. Particularly when a two way relay node receives and transmits data from the same set of users, it has some potential to exploit the receiver side information while encoding the transmitted signals. When there are some users communicating with users under a different relay or base station, that presents some additional complexity. This poster points out and compares some possible methods to encode the data streams for different users in intra and inter cellular environments.", "M-ary Signaling for Ultra Wideband Communication Systems Based on Pulse Position and \nOrthogonal Pulse Shape Modulation \u00d7 Close The Infona portal uses cookies, ie strings of text \nsaved by a browser on the user's device.
