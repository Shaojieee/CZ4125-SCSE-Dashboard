user-generated data, Internet and financial companies, and supply chain systems) over the past two decades. The term big data was coined to capture the meaning of this emerging trend. In addition to its sheer volume, big data also exhibits other unique characteristics as compared with traditional data. For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions.

However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs.

Energy consumption models are pivotal in designing and optimizing energy-efficient operations to curb excessive energy consumption in data centers. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art techniques used for energy consumption modeling and prediction for data centers and their components. We conduct an in-depth study of the existing literature on data center power modeling, covering more than 200 models. We organize these models in a hierarchical structure with two main branches focusing on hardware-centric and software-centric power models. Under hardware-centric approaches we start from the digital circuit level and move on to describe higher-level energy consumption models at the hardware component level, server level, data center level, and finally systems of systems level. Under the software\u00a0\u2026", "The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks.

Our objective is to conserve energy for the mobile device, by optimally executing mobile applications in the mobile device (i.e., mobile execution) or offloading to the cloud (i.e., cloud execution). One can, in the former case sequentially reconfigure the CPU frequency; or in the latter case dynamically vary the data transmission rate to the cloud, in response to the stochastic channel condition. We formulate both scheduling problems as constrained optimization problems, and obtain closed-form solutions for optimal scheduling policies. Furthermore, for the energy-optimal execution strategy of applications with small output data (e.g., CloudAV), we derive a threshold policy, which states that the data consumption rate, defined as the ratio between the data size (L) and the delay constraint (T), is\u00a0\u2026", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently become a hot research topic; however, they have been studied since 2014, and a large number of algorithms have been proposed. Nevertheless, few comprehensive studies explain the connections among different GAN variants and how they have evolved. In this paper, we attempt to provide a review of the various GAN methods from the perspectives of algorithms, theory, and applications. First, the motivations, mathematical representations, and structures of most GAN algorithms are introduced in detail, and we compare their commonalities and differences. Second, theoretical issues related to GANs are investigated. Finally, typical applications of GANs in image processing and computer vision, natural language processing, music, speech and audio, the medical field, and data science are discussed.", "We extend the computation and information sharing capabilities of networked robotics by proposing a cloud robotic architecture. The cloud robotic architecture leverages the combination of an ad-hoc cloud formed by machine-to-machine (M2M) communications among participating robots, and an infrastructure cloud enabled by machine-to-cloud (M2C) communications. Cloud robotics utilizes an elastic computing model, in which resources are dynamically allocated from a shared resource pool in the ubiquitous cloud, to support task offloading and information sharing in robotic applications. We propose and evaluate communication protocols, and several elastic computing models to handle different applications. We discuss the technical challenges in computation, communications and security, and illustrate the potential benefits of cloud robotics in different applications.", "In the era of mobile Internet, mobile operators are facing pressure on ever-increasing capital expenditures and operating expenses with much less growth of income. Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is expected to be a candidate of next generation access network techniques that can solve operators' puzzle. In this article, on the basis of a general survey of C-RAN, we present a novel logical structure of C-RAN that consists of a physical plane, a control plane, and a service plane. Compared to traditional architecture, the proposed C-RAN architecture emphasizes the notion of service cloud, service-oriented resource scheduling and management, thus it facilitates the utilization of new communication and computer techniques. With the extensive computation resource offered by the cloud platform, a coordinated user scheduling algorithm and parallel optimum precoding scheme are proposed, which can achieve\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we propose to leverage cloud computing to tame resource-poor mobile devices. Specifically, mobile applications can be executed in the mobile device (known as mobile execution) or offloaded to the cloud clone for execution (known as cloud execution), with an objective to conserve energy for mobile device. The energy-optimal execution policy is obtained by solving two constrained optimization problems, i.e., how to optimally configure the clock frequency to complete CPU cycles for mobile execution, and how to optimally schedule the data transmission for cloud execution in order to achieve the minimal energy within time delay. Closed-form solutions are obtained for both cases and applied to decide the optimal condition under whether the local execution or the remote execution is more energy-efficient for the mobile device. Moreover, numerical results illustrate that a significant amount of energy (e\u00a0\u2026", "This paper investigates collaborative task execution between a mobile device and a cloud clone for mobile applications under a stochastic wireless channel. A mobile application is modeled as a sequence of tasks that can be executed on the mobile device or on the cloud clone. We aim to minimize the energy consumption on the mobile device while meeting a time deadline, by strategically offloading tasks to the cloud. We formulate the collaborative task execution as a constrained shortest path problem. We derive a one-climb policy by characterizing the optimal solution and then propose an enumeration algorithm for the collaborative task execution in polynomial time. Further, we apply the LARAC algorithm to solving the optimization problem approximately, which has lower complexity than the enumeration algorithm. Simulation results show that the approximate solution of the LARAC algorithm is close to the\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, a new notion which we call private data deduplication protocol, a deduplication technique for private data storage is introduced and formalized. Intuitively, a private data deduplication protocol allows a client who holds a private data proves to a server who holds a summary string of the data that he/she is the owner of that data without revealing further information to the server. Our notion can be viewed as a complement of the state-of-the-art public data deduplication protocols of Halevi et al [7]. The security of private data deduplication protocols is formalized in the simulation-based framework in the context of two-party computations. A construction of private deduplication protocols based on the standard cryptographic assumptions is then presented and analyzed. We show that the proposed private data deduplication protocol is provably secure assuming that the underlying hash function is collision\u00a0\u2026", "This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on Predictive Maintenance (PdM) with emphasis on system architectures, purposes and approaches. In industry, any outages and unplanned downtime of machines or systems would degrade or interrupt a company's core business, potentially resulting in significant penalties and unmeasurable reputation loss. Existing traditional maintenance approaches suffer from some assumptions and limits, such as high prevent/repair costs, inadequate or inaccurate mathematical degradation processes and manual feature extraction. With the trend of smart manufacturing and development of Internet of Things (IoT), data mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI), etc., PdM is proposed as a novel type of maintenance paradigm to perform maintenances only after the analytical models predict certain failures or degradations. In this survey, we first provide a high-level view of the PdM system architectures including the Open System Architecture for Condition Based Monitoring (OSA-CBM), cloud-enhanced PdM system and PdM 4.0, etc. Then, we make clear the specific maintenance purposes/objectives, which mainly comprise cost minimization, availability/reliability maximization and multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we provide a review of the existing approaches for fault diagnosis and prognosis in PdM systems that include three major subcategories: knowledge based, traditional Machine Learning (ML) based and DL based approaches. We make a brief review on the knowledge based and traditional ML based approaches applied in diverse industrial systems or components with a complete list of\u00a0\u2026", "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has proven an effective tool for two-view dimension reduction due to its profound theoretical foundation and success in practical applications. In respect of multi-view learning, however, it is limited by its capability of only handling data represented by two-view features, while in many real-world applications, the number of views is frequently many more. Although the ad hoc way of simultaneously exploring all possible pairs of features can numerically deal with multi-view data, it ignores the high order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all features. Therefore, in this work, we develop tensor CCA (TCCA) which straightforwardly yet naturally generalizes CCA to handle the data of an arbitrary number of views by analyzing the covariance tensor of the different views. TCCA aims to directly maximize the canonical correlation of\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal content cache management for HTTP adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming over wireless networks. Specifically, in the media cloud, each content is transcoded into a set of media files with diverse playback rates, and appropriate files will be dynamically chosen in response to channel conditions and screen forms. Our design objective is to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of an individual content for the end users, under a limited storage budget. Deriving a logarithmic QoE model from our experimental results, we formulate the individual content cache management for HTTP ABR streaming over wireless network as a constrained convex optimization problem. We adopt a two-step process to solve the snapshot problem. First, using the Lagrange multiplier method, we obtain the numerical solution of the set of playback rates for a fixed number of cache copies and\u00a0\u2026", "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) are extremely energy consuming, accounting for 40% of total building energy consumption. It is crucial to design some energy-efficient building thermal comfort control strategy which can reduce the energy consumption of the HVAC while maintaining the comfort of the occupants. However, implementing such a strategy is challenging, because the changes of the thermal states in a building environment are influenced by various factors. The relationships among these influencing factors are hard to model and are always different in different building environments. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework, DeepComfort, for thermal comfort control in buildings. We formulate the thermal comfort control as a cost-minimization problem by jointly considering the energy consumption of the HVAC and the occupants' thermal\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, after proposing a novel metric, i.e., global resource capacity (GRC), to quantify the embedding potential of each substrate node, we propose an efficient heuristic virtual network embedding (VNE) algorithm, called as GRC-VNE. The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the revenue and to minimize the cost of the infrastructure provider (InP). Based on GRC, the proposed algorithm applies a greedy load-balance manner to embed each virtual node sequentially, and then adopts the shortest path routing to embed each virtual link. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed GRC-VNE algorithm achieves lower request blocking probability and higher revenue due to the more appropriate consideration of the resource distribution of the entire network, when compared to the two lastest VNE algorithms that also consider the resources of entire substrate network. Then, we introduce a classical reserved\u00a0\u2026", "Data centers (DCs), owing to the exponential growth of Internet services, have emerged as an irreplaceable and crucial infrastructure to power this ever-growing trend. A DC typically houses a large number of computing and storage nodes, interconnected by a specially designed network, namely, DC network (DCN). The DCN serves as a communication backbone and plays a pivotal role in optimizing DC operations. However, compared to the traditional network, the unique requirements in the DCN, for example, large scale, vast application diversity, high power density, and high reliability, pose significant challenges to its infrastructure and operations. We have observed from the premium publication venues (e.g., journals and system conferences) that increasing research efforts are being devoted to optimize the design and operations of the DCN. In this paper, we aim to present a systematic taxonomy and survey of\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of economic and pricing models for resource management in cloud networking. To achieve sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction, and flexibility in provisioning of cloud resources, resource management in cloud networking requires adaptive and robust designs to address many issues, e.g., resource allocation, bandwidth reservation, request allocation, and workload allocation. Economic and pricing models have received a lot of attention as they can lead to desirable performance in terms of social welfare, fairness, truthfulness, profit, user satisfaction, and resource utilization. This paper reviews applications of the economic and pricing models to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for resource management in cloud networking. Besides, we survey a variety of incentive mechanisms using the pricing strategies in sharing resources in\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we investigate the scheduling policy for collaborative execution in mobile cloud computing. A mobile application is represented by a sequence of fine-grained tasks formulating a linear topology, and each of them is executed either on the mobile device or offloaded onto the cloud side for execution. The design objective is to minimize the energy consumed by the mobile device, while meeting a time deadline. We formulate this minimum-energy task scheduling problem as a constrained shortest path problem on a directed acyclic graph, and adapt the canonical \u201cLARAC\u201d algorithm to solving this problem approximately. Numerical simulation suggests that a one-climb offloading policy is energy efficient for the Markovian stochastic channel, in which at most one migration from mobile device to the cloud is taken place for the collaborative task execution. Moreover, compared to standalone mobile execution\u00a0\u2026", "The swift adoption of cloud services is accelerating the deployment of data centers. These data centers are consuming a large amount of energy, which is expected to grow dramatically under the existing technological trends. Therefore, research efforts are in great need to architect green data centers with better energy efficiency. The most prominent approach is the consolidation enabled by virtualization. However, little effort has been paid to the potential overhead in energy usage and the throughput reduction for virtualized servers. Clear understanding of energy usage on virtualized servers lays out a solid foundation for green data-center architecture. This paper investigates how virtualization affects the energy usage in servers under different task loads, aiming to understand a fundamental trade-off between the energy saving from consolidation and the detrimental effects from virtualization. We adopt an\u00a0\u2026", "Data center (DC) plays an important role to support services, such as e-commerce and cloud computing. The resulting energy consumption from this growing market has drawn significant attention, and noticeably almost half of the energy cost is used to cool the DC to a particular temperature. It is thus an critical operational challenge to curb the cooling energy cost without sacrificing the thermal safety of a DC. The existing solutions typically follow a two-step approach, in which the system is first modeled based on expert knowledge and, thus, the operational actions are determined with heuristics and/or best practices. These approaches are often hard to generalize and might result in suboptimal performances due to intrinsic model errors for large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose optimizing the DC cooling control via the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework.

We start with two alternative perspectives for cloud mobile media networks: an end-to-end view and a layered view. Summaries of existing research in this area are organized according to the layered service framework: i) cloud resource management and control in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), ii) cloud-based media services in platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and iii) novel cloud-based systems and applications in software-as-a-service (SaaS). We further substantiate our proposed design principles for cloud-based mobile media using a concrete case study: a cloud-centric media platform (CCMP) developed at Nanyang Technological University. Finally, this paper concludes with an outlook of open research problems for realizing the vision of cloud-based mobile media.", "We consider the problem of detecting failures for all-optical networks, with the objective of keeping the diagnosis cost low. Compared to the passive paradigm based on parity check in SONET, optical probing signals are sent proactively along lightpaths to probe their state of health and failure pattern is identified through the set of test results (i.e., probe syndromes). As an alternative to our previous adaptive approach where all the probes are sent sequentially, we consider in this work a non-adaptive approach where all the probes are sent in parallel. The design objective is to minimize the number of parallel probes, so as to keep network cost low. The non-adaptive fault diagnosis approach motivates a new technical framework that we introduce: combinatorial group testing with graph-based constraints. Using this framework, we develop several new probing schemes to detect network faults for all-optical networks\u00a0\u2026", "The increasing popularity of online social networks (OSNs) has been transforming the dissemination pattern of social video contents. We can utilize the social information propagation pattern to improve the efficiency of social video distribution. In this paper, motivated by the social community classification, we present a social video replication and user request dispatching mechanism in the cloud content delivery network architecture to reduce the system operational cost, while guaranteeing the averaged service latency. Specifically, we first present a community classification method that clusters social users with social relationships, close geolocations, and similar video watching interests into various communities. Then, we conduct a large-scale measurement on a real OSN system to study the diversities of social video propagation and the effectiveness of our communities on smoothing the diversity. Finally, we\u00a0\u2026", "In computer vision, image datasets used for classification are naturally associated with multiple labels and comprised of multiple views, because each image may contain several objects (e.g., pedestrian, bicycle, and tree) and is properly characterized by multiple visual features (e.g., color, texture, and shape). Currently, available tools ignore either the label relationship or the view complementarily. Motivated by the success of the vector-valued function that constructs matrix-valued kernels to explore the multilabel structure in the output space, we introduce multiview vector-valued manifold regularization (MV 3 MR) to integrate multiple features. MV 3 MR exploits the complementary property of different features and discovers the intrinsic local geometry of the compact support shared by different features under the theme of manifold regularization. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging, but popular\u00a0\u2026", "The emergence of cloud computing provides a cost-effective approach to deliver video streams to a large number of end users with the desired user quality of experience (QoE). Under such a paradigm, a video service provider (VSP) can launch its own video streaming services virtually by renting the distribution infrastructure from one or more cloud service providers (CSPs). However, CSPs such as Amazon EC2 normally offer multiple pricing options for virtual machine (VM) instances that they can provide, such as on-demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances. Such diverse pricing models make it challenging for a VSP to determine how to optimally procure the required number of VM instances in different types to satisfy dynamic user demands. Given the limited budget, a VSP needs to carefully balance the procurement cost and the achieved QoE for end users.

A family of failure-localization algorithms that exploit the unique properties of all-optical networks is proposed. Optical probe signals are sequentially sent along a set of designed lightpaths, and the network state is inferred from the result of this set of end-to-end measurements. The design objective is to minimize the diagnosis effort (e.g., the average number of probes) to locate failures. By establishing a mathematical equivalence between the fault-diagnosis problem and the source-coding problem in information theory, we obtain a tight lower bound for the minimum average number of probes per edge (of the network modeled as a graph) as Hb(p), the entropy of the individual edges.

Recently, matrix completion (MC) has been developed to deal with multi-label classification tasks. MC has distinct advantages, such as robustness to missing entries in the feature and label spaces and a natural ability to handle multi-label problems. However, current MC-based multi-label image classification methods only consider data represented by a single-view feature, therefore, do not precisely characterize images that contain several semantic concepts. An intuitive way to utilize multiple features taken from different views is to concatenate the different features into a long vector; however, this concatenation is prone to over-fitting and leads to high time complexity in MC-based image classification. Therefore, we present a novel multi-view learning model for MC-based image classification, called low-rank multi-view matrix completion (lrMMC), which first seeks a low-dimensional common representation of all views by utilizing the proposed low-rank multi-view learning (lrMVL) algorithm. In lrMVL, the common subspace is constrained to be low rank so that it is suitable for MC. In addition, combination weights are learned to explore complementarity between different views. An efficient solver based on fixed-point continuation (FPC) is developed for optimization, and the learned low-rank representation is then incorporated into MC-based image classification. Extensive experimentation on the challenging PASCAL VOC'07 dataset demonstrates the superiority of lrMMC\u00a0\u2026", "Feature selection is beneficial for improving the performance of general machine learning tasks by extracting an informative subset from the high-dimensional features. Conventional feature selection methods usually ignore the class imbalance problem, thus the selected features will be biased towards the majority class. Considering that F-measure is a more reasonable performance measure than accuracy for imbalanced data, this paper presents an effective feature selection algorithm that explores the class imbalance issue by optimizing F-measures. Since F-measure optimization can be decomposed into a series of cost-sensitive classification problems, we investigate the cost-sensitive feature selection by generating and assigning different costs to each class with rigorous theory guidance. After solving a series of cost-sensitive feature selection problems, features corresponding to the best F-measure will be\u00a0\u2026", "Trust and security have been considered as built-in properties for future Internet architecture. Leveraging the concept of named content in recently proposed information centric network, we propose a name-based trust and security protection mechanism. Our scheme is built with identity-based cryptography (IBC), where the identity of a user or device can act as a public key string. Uniquely, in named content network such as content-centric network (CCN), a content name or its prefixes can be used as public identities, with which content integrity and authenticity can be achieved with IBC algorithms. The trust of a content is seamlessly integrated with the verification of the content's integrity and authenticity with its name or prefix, instead of the public key certificate of its publisher. In addition, flexible confidentiality protection is enabled between content publishers and consumers.

In this article, we present a survey on enabling DCN technologies for future cloud infrastructures through which the huge amount of resources in data centers can be efficiently managed. Specifically, we start with a detailed investigation of the architecture, technologies, and design principles for future DCN. Following that, we highlight some of the design challenges and open issues that should be addressed for future DCN to improve its energy efficiency and increase its throughput while lowering its cost.", "Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of deep-network based services and applications. A practical and critical problem thus has emerged: how to effectively deploy the deep neural network models such that they can be executed efficiently. Conventional cloud-based approaches usually run the deep models in data center servers, causing large latency because a significant amount of data has to be transferred from the edge of network to the data center. In this paper, we propose JALAD, a joint accuracy- and latency-aware execution framework, which decouples a deep neural network so that a part of it will run at edge devices and the other part inside the conventional cloud, while only a minimum amount of data has to be transferred between them. Though the idea seems straightforward, we are facing challenges including i)how to find the best partition of a deep structure; ii)how to deploy the component at\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient job-dispatching algorithm for transcoding as a service (TaaS) in a multimedia cloud. We aim to minimize the energy consumption of service engines in the cloud while achieving low delay for TaaS. We formulate the job-dispatching problem as a constrained optimization problem under the framework of Lyapunov optimization. Using the drift-plus-penalty function, we propose an online algorithm that dispatches the transcoding jobs to service engines, with an objective to Reduce Energy consumption while achieving the QUEue STability (REQUEST).

The high communication overhead is one of the major performance bottlenecks for distributed DNN training across multiple GPUs. Our investigations have shown that popular open-source DNN systems could only achieve 2.5 speedup ratio on 64 GPUs connected by 56 Gbps network. To address this problem, we propose a communication backend named GradientFlow for distributed DNN training, and employ a set of network optimization techniques. First, we integrate ring-based allreduce, mixed-precision training, and computation/communication overlap into GradientFlow. Second, we propose lazy allreduce to improve network throughput by fusing multiple communication operations into a single one, and design coarse-grained sparse communication to reduce network traffic by only transmitting important gradient\u00a0\u2026", "Community detection is an important issue due to its wide use in designing network protocols such as data forwarding in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and worm containment in Online Social Networks (OSN). However, most of the existing community detection algorithms focus on binary networks. Since most networks are naturally weighted such as DTN or OSN, in this article, we address the problems of community detection in weighted networks, exploit community for data forwarding in DTN and worm containment in OSN, and demonstrate how community can facilitate these network designs. Specifically, we propose a novel community detection algorithm, and introduce two metrics: intra-centrality and inter-centrality, to characterize nodes in communities, based on which we propose an efficient data forwarding algorithm for DTN and a worm containment strategy for OSN.

However, it could incur a tremendous cost. Meanwhile, most viewers terminate viewing sessions within 20% of their durations; only a small fraction of each video is consumed. Built upon this user viewing pattern, we propose a Partial Transcoding Scheme for content management in media clouds. Particularly, each content is encoded into different bitrates and split into segments. Some of the segments are stored in cache, resulting in storage cost; others are transcoded online in the case of cache miss, resulting in computing cost. We aim to minimize the long-term overall cost by determining whether a segment should be cached or transcoded online. We formulate it as a constrained stochastic optimization problem.

In order to estimate an accurate age or age group of a facial image, most of the existing algorithms require a huge face data set attached with age labels. This imposes a constraint on the utilization of the immensely unlabeled or weakly labeled training data, e.g., the huge amount of human photos in the social networks. These images may provide no age label, but it is easy to derive the age difference for an image pair of the same person. To improve the age estimation accuracy, we propose a novel learning scheme to take advantage of these weakly labeled data through the deep convolutional neural networks.

We, therefore, propose a novel large margin multi-modal multi-task feature extraction (LM3FE) framework for handling multi-modal features for image classification. In particular, LM3FE simultaneously learns the feature extraction matrix for each modality and the modality combination coefficients. In this way, LM3FE not only handles correlated and noisy features, but also utilizes the complementarity of different\u00a0\u2026", "Mobile cloud computing has been proposed as an effective solution to augment the capabilities of resource-poor mobile devices.

However, existing content delivery networks may not be cost efficient enough to distribute adaptive video streaming, mainly due to the lack of orchestration on storage, computing, and bandwidth resources. In this paper, we leverage Media Cloud to deliver on-demand adaptive video streaming services, where those resources can be dynamically scheduled in an on-demand fashion. Our objective is to minimize the total operational cost by optimally orchestrating multiple resources. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem, by examining a three-way tradeoff between the caching, transcoding, and bandwidth costs, at each edge server.

However, due to its long-tail nature, UGC presents a list of design challenges in media distribution, which in turn dictate a set of required features to support UGC delivery. Existing solutions based on content delivery network (CDN), due to their lack of all the required features, are often inadequate. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of Content-Delivery-as-a-Service (CoDaaS). Specifically, virtual Content Delivery Service (vCDS) is configured, in an on-demand manner, for UGC providers to distribute their contents to a group of designated consumers.

Previous work focused on optimally placing virtual machines with cloud providers to minimize total cost. However, many applications require large amounts of network bandwidth. Therefore, considering only virtual machines offers an incomplete view of the system.

However, the increasing awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image data that grows explosively in multiple parties (eg mobile phones and cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning framework, FedU.

On the one hand, applications are growing at an accelerated pace, which is fundamentally unpredictable in both breadth and depth. On the other hand, the underlying networking has been the focus of a huge transformation enabled by new models resulting from virtualization and cloud computing. This has led to a number of novel architectures supported by emerging technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and more recently, edge cloud and fog networking, or network slicing   ,   .

In this paper, we propose a public cloud-assisted architecture to tackle this problem. In particular, by motivating mobile users to upload videos to the local public cloud to serve requests, and, therefore, having a permission to access friends' videos stored in the cloud, our method can alleviate the traffic burden to the social service providers, while reducing the service latency of mobile users. First, we present a general framework to model the information diffusion and utility function of each user on the proposed architecture, and formulate the problem as a decentralized social utility maximization game.

One distinguishing aspect of smart grid communication networks is the large-scale deployment of smart meters and sensors. Thus, a large amount of data and information will be generated from metering, sensing, monitoring, etc. Data aggregation (integration or fusion) aims at the merging of data from disparate sources with differing conceptual, contextual, and typographical representations. In order to satisfy the requirement of different information services, the placement of data aggregation services in smart grid communication networks is a critical design issue.

In reality, mobile video applications commonly adopt buffering techniques to handle bandwidth fluctuation and minimize the impact of stochastic wireless channels on user experiences. However, recent measurement work reveals that mobile users tend to abort more frequently than PC users during viewing videos. Such a high abortion rate results in a significant wastage of buffered video data, which is directly translated into monetary and energy cost for mobile users. In this paper, we propose an intelligent buffer management strategy called CBM (Cost-aware Buffer Management), for mobile video streaming applications. Our purpose is to minimize cost induced by un-consumed video data while respecting certain user experience requirements.

When the labeled information in a target domain is limited, transfer metric learning (TML) helps to learn the metric by leveraging the sufficient information from other related domains. Multitask metric learning (MTML), which can be regarded as a special case of TML, performs transfer across all related domains. Current TML tools usually assume that the same feature representation is exploited for different domains. However, in real-world applications, data may be drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches can be adopted to remedy this drawback by deriving a metric from the learned transformation across different domains. However, they are often limited in that only two domains can be handled. To appropriately handle multiple domains, we develop a novel heterogeneous\u00a0\u2026", "Rate adaptation is widely adopted in video streaming to improve the quality of experience (QoE). However, most of the existing rate adaptation approaches neglect the underlying video semantic information. In fact, influenced by video semantics and viewer preferences, the viewer may have different degrees of interest on different parts of a video. The interesting parts of a video can draw more visual attention from the viewer and have higher visual importance. As such, delivering the parts of a video that are interesting to the viewer in a higher quality can improve the perceptual video quality, compared with the semantics-agnostic approaches that treat each part of a video equally. Thus, it is natural to wonder: how to allocate bitrate budgets temporally over a video session under time-varying bandwidth while considering viewer interest? As an exploratory study, we propose an interest-aware rate adaptation approach\u00a0\u2026", "Many cluster management systems (CMSs) have been proposed to share a single cluster with multiple distributed computing systems. However, none of the existing approaches can handle distributed machine learning (ML) workloads given the following criteria: high resource utilization, fair resource allocation and low sharing overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a new CMS named Dorm, incorporating a dynamically-partitioned cluster management mechanism and an utilization-fairness optimizer. Specifically, Dorm uses the container-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one application per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at application runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for resources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead.

However, traditional approaches could not avoid the service interruption completely. Moreover, they often result in longer delay and are prone to failures. In this paper, we leverage the emerging named data networking (NDN) to design an efficient and robust protocol to support seamless virtual machine migration in cloud data center. Specifically, virtual machines (VMs) are named with the services they provide. Request routing is based on service names instead of IP addresses that are normally bounded with physical machines. As such, services would not be interrupted when migrating supported VMs to different physical machines. We further analyze the performance of our proposed NDN-based VM migration protocol, and optimize its\u00a0\u2026", "Disasters (e.g., earthquakes, flooding, tornadoes, oil spilling and mining accidents) often result in tremendous cost to our society. Previously, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proposed and deployed to provide information for decision making in post-disaster relief operations. The existing WSN solutions for post-disaster operations normally assume that the deployed sensor network can tolerate the damage caused by disasters and maintain its connectivity and coverage, even though a significant portion of nodes have been physically destroyed. In reality, however, this assumption is often invalid for disastrous events like earthquakes in large scale, limiting the relief capability of the existing solutions.

Feature selection offers several advantages in highly dimensional cases. Recently, multi-task feature selection has attracted much attention, and has been shown to often outperform the traditional single-task feature selection. Current multi-task feature selection methods are either supervised or unsupervised. In this paper, we address the semi-supervised multi-task feature selection problem. We firstly introduce manifold regularization in multi-task feature selection to utilize the limited number of labeled samples and the relatively large amount of unlabeled samples. However, the graph constructed in manifold regularization from a single feature representation (view) may be unreliable. We thus propose to construct the graph using the heterogeneous feature representations from multiple views.

However, solutions to this problem, including static power models and canonical prediction models, either aim to build a static relationship between power consumption and hardware/application configurations without considering the dynamic fluctuation of power; or simply treat it as time series, ignoring the inherit power data characteristics. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we present a systematic power prediction framework based on extensive power dynamic profiling and deep learning models. In particular, we first analyse different power series samples to illustrate their noise patterns; accordingly we propose a power data de-noising method, which lowers noise interference to the modelling.

A number of recent works have used high throughput graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate SpGEMM. However, exploiting the power of GPUs for SpGEMM requires addressing a number of challenges, including highly imbalanced workloads and large numbers of inefficient random global memory accesses. This paper presents a SpGEMM algorithm which uses several novel techniques to overcome these problems. We first propose two low cost methods to achieve perfect load balancing during the most expensive step in SpGEMM. Next, we show how to eliminate nearly all random global memory accesses using shared memory based hash tables. To optimize the performance of the hash tables, we propose a lightweight method to estimate the number of nonzeros in the output matrix.

It enables mobile users to create ultra-short video clips and instantly share them with social friends. Due to the huge volume of videos and limited available bandwidth of wireless infrastructure, it is challenging to distribute these massive videos to mobile users with satisfactory quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we present a general framework to model the video diffusion among mobile users and user QoS of the MSVS service over the wireless infrastructure. Then, we utilize the hierarchical structure to decompose this problem into two subproblems, including a bitrate adjustment and spectrum allocation problems. For the bitrate adjustment problem, we propose a QoS estimation model based on the large deviation principle.

The proposed algorithm, named as revenue-driven VNE (RD-VNE), adopts a node-ranking approach that takes the global resource information into account in a recursive manner to assist the greedy node mapping, and leverages the shortest-path routing for link mapping. Our simulation results suggest that the proposed VNE algorithm outperforms two existing VNE algorithms that also take global resource information into consideration, in terms of request blocking probability, and brings higher time-average revenue to the infrastructure provider (InP).", "The Internet explosion makes energy consumption of the ICT sector a global concern. Nowadays, the power consumption of access networks increases rapidly due to the rollout of broadband services. Cable access networks provide Internet access over the existing cable television systems. Among all wired access networks, they have the second biggest user base, which is still growing fast due to the release of the new industry standard, DOCSIS 3.0. Therefore, we expect that cable access networks will play an important role in the ICT sector of future smart cities. In order to boost up bidirectional throughput, DOCSIS 3.0 introduces the channel bonding technology, which could lead to increased power consumption if not properly managed.

We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of cloud and edge.

However, recent works discovered that an adversary can fully recover the sensitive training samples from the shared gradients. Such reconstruction attacks pose severe threats to collaborative learning. Hence, effective mitigation solutions are urgently desired. In this paper, we propose to leverage data augmentation to defeat reconstruction attacks: by preprocessing sensitive images with carefully-selected transformation policies, it becomes infeasible for the adversary to extract any useful information from the corresponding gradients. We design a novel search method to automatically discover qualified policies. We adopt two new metrics to quantify the impacts of transformations on data privacy and model usability, which can significantly accelerate the search speed. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the policies discovered by our method can defeat existing reconstruction attacks in collaborative learning, with high efficiency and negligible impact on the model performance.", "Recently, network operators around the world have encountered a paradox. On the one hand, they have made enormous investments to handle the tremendous growth of Internet media services triggered by the ubiquitous penetration of high-speed wireless networks and the increasing popularity of mobile devices.

The objective of operator tree placement is to minimize the total energy consumed in performing in-network processing. Two types of placement algorithms, centralized and distributed, have been proposed. A problem with the centralized algorithm is that it does not scale to large WSN's, because each sensor node is required to know the complete topology of the network.

It needs to determine the strategy for intelligently provisioning the right amount of resource under dynamic workload to meet the heterogeneous QoS requirements. To this end, this paper develops a robust dynamic resource provisioning scheme for transcoding with heterogeneous QoS criteria.

ICACR is a variation of IPACR because it can be suitable for clustering cases to satisfy the larger scale situations. Both the numerical algorithm performance analysis and simulation of IPACR and ICACR are given. The results show that ICACR outperforms IPACR in terms of both network lifetime and QoS-aware routing metrics in large scale wireless multimedia sensor networks. Moreover, the simulation based on the real video traces shows that by extending the multi-path to ICACR for different priorities of video frames better performance can be achieved.", "Distance metric learning (DML) aims to find an appropriate way to reveal the underlying data relationship. It is critical in many machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining algorithms, and usually require large amount of label information (such as class labels or pair/triplet constraints) to achieve satisfactory performance. However, the label information may be insufficient in real-world applications due to the high-labeling cost, and DML may fail in this case.

To answer this, the authors designed a network function virtualization (NFV)-based virtual cache (vCache). In vCache, video chunks have two mutually exclusive caching states: physically cached and virtually cached. A physically cached video chunk can be directly read from storage, and it consumes storage resources. A virtually cached video chunk will be transcoded online when being requested, and it consumes computing resources.

While several out-of-core graph processing systems and computation models have been proposed, the high disk I/O overhead could significantly reduce performance in many practical cases. In this paper, we propose GraphMP to tackle big graph analytics on a single machine. GraphMP achieves low disk I/O overhead with three techniques. First, we design a vertex-centric sliding window (VSW) computation model to avoid reading and writing vertices on disk. Second, we propose a selective scheduling method to skip loading and processing unnecessary edge shards on disk.

In particular, campaigns normally adopt a pragmatic approach of seeding videos with a selected list of influential users, hoping to create a viral distribution to reach as many users as possible. In this paper, we propose a multitopic-aware influence maximization framework to identify a fixed number of influential users and assign video clips of specific topics to them, with an ultimate objective to maximize the number of message deliveries, defined as expected posting number (EPN). We first prove the submodularity of the EPN function, resulting in a general greedy algorithm with a performance bound of 1-1/e.

Specifically, we propose a two-step iterative approach. First, in NFV-based resource allocation phase, we maximize total cache hits by optimally allocating storage and computing resources for a giving routing policy. Second, in SDN-based routing phase, we minimize the networking cost by optimally configuring the routing matrix for a given resource placement.

However, it usually suffers from the long-tail issue. The training data mainly concentrates on a few types of relations, leading to the lack of sufficient annotations for the remaining types of relations. In this paper, we propose a general approach to learn relation prototypes from unlabeled texts, to facilitate the long-tail relation extraction by transferring knowledge from the relation types with sufficient training data. We learn relation prototypes as an implicit factor between entities, which reflects the meanings of relations as well as their proximities for transfer learning. Specifically, we construct a co-occurrence graph from texts, and capture both first-order and second-order entity proximities for embedding learning. Based on this, we further optimize the distance from entity pairs to corresponding prototypes\u00a0\u2026", "To provide elastic cloud services with QoS guarantee, it is essential for cloud data centers to provision virtual machines rapidly according to user requests.

In this paper, we develop a simple theoretic model to analyze two typical P2P models for VM image distribution, namely, isolated-image P2P distribution model and cross-image P2P distribution model. We compare their efficiency under different parameter settings and derive their corresponding optimal server bandwidth allocation strategies. In addition, we also propose a practical optimal server bandwidth provisioning algorithm for chunk-level cross-image P2P distribution mechanism to further improve its efficiency.

This solution may consume significant resources and incur intolerable processing delays. Meanwhile, different videos have different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for transcoding. Delay-sensitive videos must be transcoded within a strict deadline, whereas delay-tolerant videos are not required to be transcoded immediately. Some intelligent policies are required for provisioning the right amount of resources in the transcoding system to meet the heterogeneous QoS requirements, especially under dynamic workloads. To this end, we develop a robust dynamic priority-based resource provisioning scheme for video transcoding.

However, the benefits of such an approach depend on proper channel state information (CSI) availability at the transmitter. The CSI is usually estimated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter through a band-limited channel. Thus, an efficient feedback scheme is needed. In this paper, a comprehensive Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) based feedback mechanism is proposed for time-varying spatially and temporally correlated vector autoregression (VAR) wireless channel, and the feedback rate distortion function is derived in closed form in statistics. The proposed BCS feedback scheme utilizes the sparse CSI features and prior knowledge to significantly compress the dimensionality of the feedback CSI.

The novelty of our FUN approach lies in combining the best features of fountain coding, intra-session network coding, and cross-next-hop network coding. This paper provides an in-depth study of FUN codes. First, we theoretically analyze the throughput of FUN codes. Second, we identify several practical issues that may undermine the actual performance, such as buffer overflow, and quantify the resulting throughput degradation. Finally, we propose a systematic design to overcome these issues. Simulation results in TDMA multi-hop networks show that our methods yield near-optimal throughput and are significantly better than fountain codes and existing network coding schemes.", "The dramatic growth of user-generated contents (UGCs) transforms the digital media value chain, and stresses current content distribution network (CDN). In order to deliver UGCs in an efficient and economical fashion, we have proposed content-delivery-as-a-service (CoDaaS) by leveraging cloud computing technology. However, due to the exponential increase of Internet traffic (especially the UGCs), traditional hashing-based content routing and lookup scheme in CDNs suffers from high delay and consequent inefficient delivery. This paper introduces a global compressed counting BF (CCBF) into CoDaaS to address this issue. By equipping it with the global CCBF, our system is able to check early on for the existence of any specific content among all the peering surrogates, before any local checking on each cache node. Based on this global CCBF, we propose two content routing and lookup mechanisms (i.e\u00a0\u2026", "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity.

Transfer metric learning (TML) can help DML in the target domain with limited label information by utilizing information from some related source domains. The heterogeneous TML (HTML), where the feature representations vary from the source to the target domain, is general and challenging. However, current HTML approaches are usually conducted in a batch manner and cannot handle sequential data. This motivates the proposed online HTML (OHTML) method. In particular, the distance metric in the source domain is pre-trained using some existing DML algorithms. To enable knowledge transfer, we assume there are large amounts of unlabeled corresponding data that have representations in both the source and target domains. By enforcing the distances (between these unlabeled samples) in the target domain to agree with those in the source domain under the manifold regularization theme, we learn an improved target metric. We formulate the problem in the online setting so that the optimization is efficient and the model can be adapted to new coming data.

In Cloud-scale (or EB-scale) file systems, load balancing in request workloads across a metadata server cluster is critical for avoiding performance bottlenecks and improving quality of services.Many good approaches have been proposed for load balancing in distributed file systems. Some of them pay attention to global namespace balancing, making metadata distribution across metadata servers as uniform as possible. However, they do not work well in skew request distributions, which impair load balancing but simultaneously increase the effectiveness of caching and replication.

In this paper, we show that multiple stage retrieval of fragments is effective to reduce the file-retrieval delay. We first develop a delay model for various multiple stage retrieval schemes applicable to our considered system. With the developed model, we study optimal retrieval schemes given requirements on success decodability.

Our design objective is to minimize total energy consumption while respecting a deterministic delay constraint. We present a convex optimization formulation of the problem, and show that it can be decoupled into two sequential sub-problems: (i) how to allocate all packets onto the two interfaces, and (ii) how to schedule packet transmission durations over each interface. Analytical solutions for both sub-problems reveal two insightful design principles. First, the optimal packet allocation policy should follow a \"water-filling\" algorithm based on the noise level of each interface. Second, packets allocated to each wireless interface should be transmitted with equal duration while filling up the prescribed delay limit.

In the lower level, the precise modelling of VESSs is firstly built, then VESSs are aggregated via aggregators for better participating in the control scheme. Once the violation occurs, a consensus-driven control scheme in the upper level will be initiated to eliminate the error.

The increasing availability of servers that can tolerate higher temperatures and RH due to the regulatory bodies\u2019 prompts to raise DC temperature setpoints sheds light upon the feasibility of air free-cooled DCs in the tropics. However, due to the complex psychrometric dynamics, operating the air free-cooled DC in the tropics generally requires adaptive control of supply air condition to maintain the computing performance and reliability of the servers. This article studies the problem of controlling the supply air temperature and RH in a free-cooled tropical DC below certain thresholds.

As such, the training process involves overwhelmingly manual tuning and is prohibitively costly. In this research, we propose a \u201creinforcement on reinforcement\u201d (RoR) architecture to decompose the convoluted tasks into two decoupled layers of RL.

In this paper, we address this issue by using a data-driven approach to answer three questions: (1) What is a proper definition of the term data scientist from a market-demand perspective? (2) Do self-described data scientists meet the market demand? and (3) Finally, how can companies efficiently recruit data scientists that match their openings?

Our objective is to minimize the mobile cost due to both energy and time usage for servicing all the tasks. First, we adopt voltage scaling to optimize the mobile computation cost. Then, we use data compression to reduce the amount of data to transmit, to minimize the wireless transmission cost.

Transfer metric learning (TML) leverages the side information (eg, similar/dissimilar constraints over pairs of samples) from related domains to help the target metric learning (with limited information). Current TML tools usually assume that different domains exploit the same feature representation, and thus are not applicable to tasks where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches handle heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains. The learned transformation can be used to derive a metric, but these approaches are mostly limited by their capability of only handling two domains. This motivates the proposed heterogeneous multi-task metric learning (HMTML) framework for handling multiple domains by combining side information and unlabeled data. Specifically, HMTML learns the metrics for all different domains simultaneously by maximizing their high-order correlation (parameterized by feature covariance of unlabeled data) in a common subspace, which is induced by the transformations derived from the metrics. Extensive experiments on both multi-language text categorization and multi-view social image annotation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "Nowadays, location\u2010based service (LBS) has become pervasive.

However, ICN proposals may still not be cost efficient enough for adaptive video streaming. The problem is, each ICN node caches duplicated copies of the same content for each bitrate version in its limited storage space. Thus the cache hit ratio drops, and the bandwidth cost of serving the cache missed requests increases. This paper proposes PAINT (Partial In-Network Transcoding) scheme to reduce the operational cost of delivering adaptive video streaming over ICN. Specifically, we consider both the in-network caching and transcoding services at each ICN node, where the storage and transcoding resources can be dynamically scheduled. Then we formulate an optimization problem to balance the trade-off between the transcoding and bandwidth costs.

While main efforts of this research focus on server and storage power reduction, network devices as part of the key components of data centers, also contribute to the overall power consumption as data centers expand. In this paper, we address this problem with two perspectives. First, in a macro level, we attempt to reduce redundant energy usage incurred by network redundancies for load balancing. Second, in the micro level, we design algorithm to limit port rate in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption.

However, manually finding relevant ads to match the provided content is labor-intensive, and hence some automatic advertising techniques are developed. Since ads are usually hard to understand only according to its visual appearance due to the contained visual metaphor, some other modalities, such as the contained texts, should be exploited for understanding. To further improve user experience, it is necessary to understand both the ads' topic and sentiment. This motivates us to develop a novel deep multimodal multitask framework that integrates multiple modalities to achieve effective topic and sentiment prediction simultaneously for ads understanding.

However, most of the existing rate adaptation approaches for ABR are content-agnostic, without considering the semantic information of the video content. Nevertheless, semantic information largely determines the informativeness and interestingness of the video content, and consequently affects the QoE for video streaming. One common case is that the user may expect higher quality for the parts of video content that are more interesting or informative so as to reduce overall subjective quality loss. This creates two main challenges for such a problem: First, how to determine which parts of the video content are more interesting? Second, how to allocate bitrate budgets for different parts of the video content with different significances?

With ABR, each video content is transcoded into multiple representations in different bitrates and resolutions. However, video transcoding is computing intensive, which requires the transcoding service providers to deploy a large number of servers for transcoding the video contents published by the content producers. As such, a natural question for the transcoding service provider is how to provision the computing resource for transcoding the video contents while maximizing service profit. To address this problem, we design a cloud video transcoding system by taking the advantage of cloud computing technology to elastically allocate computing resource.

Recently, transfer distance metric learning (TDM-L) has attracted lots of interests, but most of these methods assume that feature representations for the source and target learning tasks are the same. Hence, they are not suitable for the applications, in which the data are from heterogeneous domains (feature spaces, modalities and even semantics). Although some existing heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL) approaches is able to handle such domains, they lack flexibility in real-world applications, and the learned transformations are often restricted to be linear. We therefore develop a general and flexible heterogeneous TDML (HTDM-L) framework based on the knowledge fragment transfer strategy. In the proposed HTDML, any (linear or nonlinear) distance metric learning algorithms can be employed to learn the source metric beforehand. Then a set of knowledge fragments are extracted from the pre-learned source metric to help target metric learning. In addition, either linear or nonlinear distance metric can be learned for the target domain.

An efficient scheduler design for such GPU datacenter is crucially important to reduce the operational cost and improve resource utilization. However, traditional approaches designed for big data or high performance computing workloads can not support DL workloads to fully utilize the GPU resources. Recently, substantial schedulers are proposed to tailor for DL workloads in GPU datacenters. This paper surveys existing research efforts for both training and inference workloads. We primarily present how existing schedulers facilitate the respective workloads from the scheduling objectives and resource consumption features. Finally, we prospect several promising future research directions.

This research aims to develop and validate an intelligent microgrid management system to secure the competitiveness of Singapore\u2019s energy market, by leveraging the inherent synergy between two emerging technologies, i.e., blockchain for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) solar power trading and fog computing for grid infrastructure management. For this vision, we have developed FogChain, an integrative, cost-effective, and scalable microgrid operating system (MGOS), consisting of three technical service layers: 1) a novel microgrid information infrastructure based on the fog-computing paradigm (i.e., intelligence on edge); 2) a blockchain-based\u00a0\u2026", "DNN-based video analytics have empowered many new applications (e.g., automated retail). Meanwhile, the proliferation of fog devices provides developers with more design options to improve performance and save cost. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first serverless system that takes full advantage of the client-fog-cloud synergy to better serve the DNN-based video analytics. Specifically, the system aims to achieve two goals: 1) Provide the optimal analytics results under the constraints of lower bandwidth usage and shorter round-trip time (RTT) by judiciously managing the computational and bandwidth resources deployed in the client, fog, and cloud environment. 2) Free developers from tedious administration and operation tasks, including DNN deployment, cloud and fog's resource management. To this end, we implement a holistic cloud-fog system referred to as VPaaS (Video-Platform-as-a-Service). VPaaS adopts serverless computing to enable developers to build a video analytics pipeline by simply programming a set of functions (e.g., model inference), which are then orchestrated to process videos through carefully designed modules. To save bandwidth and reduce RTT, VPaaS provides a new video streaming protocol that only sends low-quality video to the cloud. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs deployed at the cloud can identify regions of video frames that need further processing at the fog ends. At the fog ends, misidentified labels in these regions can be corrected using a light-weight DNN model.

Manually screening to select appropriate candidates from large amounts of resumes can be exhausted and time-consuming. However, there is no public tool that can be directly used for automatic resume quality assessment (RQA). This motivates us to develop a method for automatic RQA. Since there is also no public dataset for model training and evaluation, we build a dataset for RQA by collecting around 10K resumes, which are provided by a private resume management company. By investigating the dataset, we identify some factors or features that could be useful to discriminate good resumes from bad ones, e.g., the consistency between different parts of a resume. Then a neural-network model is designed to predict the quality of each resume, where some text processing techniques are incorporated.

In this paper, we propose the idea of Parking Backbone, which does not need any RSUs but leverages a virtual overlay network formed by outside parked vehicles to track vehicles and to disseminate messages between moving vehicles. Our scheme consists of three parts. At first, to each road, parked vehicles both at roadside and off street are grouped into a cluster as far as possible.

We term it as a traffic hole problem, which will drastically affect the data delivery along each road. For mitigating the problem, we investigate the signal operations at the intersections to adjust the traffic flows moving into the roads.", "In this paper, we propose using spatial diversity via multiple node-disjointed lightpaths at the optical layer to achieve ultra-reliable communication with low delay between any source-destination pair in all-optical networks. Using a doubly stochastic point process model and a \"genie-aided\" receiver, we obtain an exponentially tight error probability bound for the lightpath diversity scheme under an independent lightpath failure model. Error probability of the proposed scheme can be designed to be significantly lower than that of a system without lightpath diversity, and system parameters (e.g., the number of lightpaths) can be optimized to achieve efficient utilization of a limited amount of transmitted optical energy. In particular, at the optimum operating point, each lightpath is allocated an optimum average number of signal photons per bit and is biased to have an effective error probability 2f if the decision is based on\u00a0\u2026", "The rapid advancements in cloud computing, Big Data and their related applications have led to a skyrocketing increase in data center energy consumption year by year. The prior approaches for improving data center energy efficiency mostly suffer from high system dynamics or the complexity of data centers. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework based on deep reinforcement learning, named DeepEE, to jointly optimize energy consumption from the perspectives of task scheduling and cooling control. In DeepEE, a PArameterized action space based Deep Q-Network (PADQN) algorithm is proposed to tackle the hybrid action space problem.

Although the ad hoc way of simultaneously exploring all possible pairs of features can numerically deal with multi-view data, it ignores the high order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all features. Therefore, in this work, we develop tensor CCA (TCCA) which straightforwardly yet naturally generalizes CCA to handle the data of an arbitrary number of views by analyzing the covariance tensor of the different views.

Specifically, we investigate energy-efficient dispatching policy for VSaaS under N-version protection, which dispatches a file to multiple service engines for scanning in parallel to reduce the missed detection error cost. However, the benefit of N-version protection is at the cost of increasing energy consumption and the queue length of service engines. To manage this tradeoff, we aim to reduce the energy consumption of service engines and the missed detection error cost, while satisfying the queue stability for VSaaS. We formulate the file-scan dispatching policy as a stochastic optimization problem, and then propose an online algorithm to dispatch file-scan requests under N-version protection.

The principle is to make decisions based on certain critical events (e.g., overheating), rather than fixed periodic control. Specifically, we design an event-driven optimization framework to trigger control operations.

We apply this observation to several settings. First, we consider an offline setting which assumes future electricity prices are given, and propose an efficient algorithm for optimally scaling a processor's speed in order to minimize the total electrical cost for completing a task by a deadline. We then consider a more realistic stochastic setting in which future prices are not known, but vary according to a Markov model.

INTRODUCTION ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learn-ing (ML) approaches have emerged in the networking domain with great expectation.

It has been successfully applied to many pattern recognition and biometric prediction problems. Most of current MTFL methods assume that different tasks exploit the same feature representation, and thus are not applicable to the scenarios where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Existing heterogeneous transfer learning (including multi-task learning) approaches handle multiple heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains, but they ignore the high-order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all domains. We therefore develop a tensor based heterogeneous MTFL (THMTFL) framework to exploit such high-order information. Specifically, feature transformations of all domains are learned together, and finally used to derive new representations. A connection between all domains is built by using the transformations to project the pre-learned predictive structures of different domains into a common subspace, and minimizing their divergence in the subspace. By exploring the high-order information, the proposed THMTFL can obtain more reliable feature transformations compared with existing heterogeneous transfer learning approaches.

The massive parallelism of graphics processing units (GPUs) makes them well suited for Spiv computations. However, fully utilizing the power of GPUs is challenging because Spiv makes a large number of scattered memory accesses which saturate the Gnu's memory bandwidth. Most previous works sought to address the bandwidth limitation by using efficient storage formats for the matrix. However, we show that for most matrices, a majority of the bandwidth is consumed by accesses to the vector. In this paper, we introduce two techniques to significantly decrease the I/O for vector accesses, by making novel use of the Gnu's fast shared memory.

While maintaining average performance in such virtualized environments is important to conform to service level agreements (SLA), cloud users also expect their applications to have minimum variation in tail end latencies like 90th percentile latency for predictable performance. This becomes a challenging problem as the deviation in the application's 90th percentile I/O latency from average latency under storage resource sharing (VM consolidation) can be very high. We show through experiments under VM consolidation that during peak loads this latency variation from average can be as much as 5 times compared to when the application has exclusive access to the storage devices.

However, existing works are inapplicable to face recognition under privacy constraints because they require sharing sensitive face images between two domains. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised federated face recognition approach (FedFR). FedFR improves the performance in the target domain by iteratively aggregating knowledge from the source domain through federated learning. It protects data privacy by transferring models instead of raw data between domains. Besides, we propose a new domain constraint loss (DCL) to regularize source domain training. DCL suppresses the data volume dominance of the source domain. We also enhance a hierarchical clustering algorithm to predict pseudo labels for the unlabeled target domain accurately. To this end, FedFR forms an end-to-end training pipeline: (1) pre-train in the source domain; (2) predict pseudo labels by clustering in the target domain; (3) conduct domain-constrained federated learning across two domains. Extensive experiments and analysis on two newly constructed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FedFR. It outperforms the baseline and classic methods in the target domain by over 4% on the more realistic benchmark. We believe that FedFR will shed light on applying federated learning to more computer vision tasks under privacy constraints.", "It is desired (especially for young people) to shop for the same or similar products shown in the multimedia contents (such as online TV programs).

In the meanwhile, Differential Privacy (DP) emerges as a promising countermeasure to defend against gradient leakage attacks. However, the adoption of DP by clients in FL may significantly jeopardize the model accuracy. It is still an open problem to understand the practicality of DP from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the number of conducted iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally derive the convergence rate with DP noises in FL. Then, we theoretically derive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the number of global iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of local iterations (LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By further substituting the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms into the derived convergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg with the Laplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively prohibited by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can converge to a constant number finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI. To verify our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel distance measurement and build a time series classification algorithm hybridizing nearest neighbor and long short term memory (LSTM) neural network. More specifically, first we propose a new distance measurement termed as local time warping (LTW), which utilizes a user-specified index set for local warping, and is designed to be noncommutative and nondynamic programming.

However, little research work has been done to obtain traffic information efficiently and yet accurately. Researchers often assume the availability of traffic tracing tools (e.g., OpenFlow) when their proposals require traffic information as input, but these tools may generate high monitoring overhead and consume significant switch resources even if they are available in a DCN. Although estimating the traffic matrix between origin-destination pairs using only basic switch SNMP counters is a mature practice in IP networks, traffic flows in DCNs are notoriously more irregular and volatile, while the large number of redundant routes in a DCN further complicates the situation.

The multi-path opportunity inherent to the cooperative network provides a new dimension by optimally allocating all the packets into different paths to improve the user experience. Specifically, we aim to minimize the end-to-end file delay, resulting in a better experience for end users. We first show that the file delay is penalized by a path-starvation effect, which results from poor packet allocation among different paths. Secondly, our in-depth analysis of the canonical two-path case indicates that it could hurt in some cases to use more paths. Especially, when the delay variance of assigning one packet to the slower path is on the same order of that of assigning all the packets to the faster path, using one path is better than using both paths.

SuperGLUE is more challenging than the widely used general language understanding evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, containing eight difficult language understanding tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, and reasoning. [Method] Instead of arbitrarily increasing the size of a pretrained language model (PLM), our aim is to 1) fully extract knowledge from the input pretraining data given a certain parameter budget, e.g., 6B, and 2) effectively transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. To achieve goal 1), we propose self-evolution learning for PLMs to wisely predict the informative tokens that should be masked, and supervise the masked language modeling (MLM) process with rectified smooth labels. For goal 2), we leverage the prompt transfer technique to improve the low-resource tasks by transferring the knowledge from the foundation model and related downstream tasks to the target task.

As DRL opti-mizes a long-term reward, it is a promising approach to improving the energy efficiency of data center cooling. However, enforcement of thermal safety constraint during DRL's state exploration is a main challenge. The widely adopted reward shaping approach adds negative reward when the exploratory action results in unsafety. Thus, it needs to experience sufficient unsafe states before it learns how to prevent unsafety. In this paper, we propose a safety-aware DRL framework for single-hall data center cooling control.

However, considering the media dynamics on resource consumption and the QoS criteria, dynamically providing the cloud computing resource to meet the QoS requirements of media processing is not easy. The current cloud computing infrastructure usually employs auto-scaling to dynamically adjust the computing resource allocation, which is typically performed at relatively long time scale and cannot adapt to the dynamic changes of video arrivals or content changes at relatively short time scale.

A large inflow of newcomers or inexperienced investors can serve as a trigger of herding. Herding in the NFT market tends to arise when the return on Ethereum increases, but it tends to diminish as the return on Bitcoin increases.

The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been explored to approximate the CFD/HT simulation by a linear combination of POD modes and coefficients. Existing approaches to calculating the POD coefficients use either the black-box interpolation or the simplified physical model, leading to unsatisfactory generalization ability.

As a result, higher rate requires more computation resources to process the sampled data, incurring more monetary cost. Second, user needs change frequently. Thus, we need a resource allocation scheme that is (a) able to strike a good balance between accuracy and monetary cost and (b) adaptive enough to meet the frequently changing needs. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions fail on one or more fronts (e.g., simple one shot optimizations).

To accomplish benchmark-related tasks, the developers only need to prepare a configuration file consisting of a few lines of code. Our system, deployed to a leader server in DL clusters, will dispatch users' benchmark jobs to follower workers. Next, the corresponding requests, workload, and even models can be generated automatically by the system to conduct DL serving benchmarks.

In particular, we learn an agent to predict the hashing codes sequentially under the DRL theme. Each coordinate of the hashing function can take the errors incurred by previous ones into consideration and hence more reliable hashing codes can be obtained than learning them independently.

Experiment results show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal tradeoff between inter-user delay and video quality, and demonstrates resilient performance even under very fast wireless channel fading.", "Modern data centers are playing an important role in a world full of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Many efforts have been paid to build a more efficient, cleaner data center for economic, social, and environmental benefits. This objective is being enabled by emerging technologies such as cloud computing and software-defined networking (SDN). However, a data center is inherently heterogeneous, consisting of servers, networking devices, cooling devices, power supply devices, etc., resulting in daunting challenges in its management and control.

However, improper additive noise could result in bias for the aggregate result. It demands an optimal noise distribution to reduce the deviation. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework to derive the optimal noise distribution that provides privacy protection under the constraint of a limited value deviation. Specifically, we first derive a generic system dynamic function that the optimal noise distribution must satisfy, and further investigate the special case that the original values obey Gaussian distribution. Then we detailedly investigate the general cases that the original values obey arbitrary continuous distribution, which can be expressed by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

The data may be Non-IID for different clients and thus resulting in poor performance. Recently, personalized federated learning (PFL) has achieved great success in handling Non-IID data by enforcing regularization in local optimization or improving the model aggregation scheme on the server. However, most of the PFL approaches do not take into account the unfair competition issue caused by the imbalanced data distribution and lack of positive samples for some classes in each client. To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic PFL framework termed Federated Averaging via Binary Classification, dubbed FedABC. In particular, we adopt the ``one-vs-all'' training strategy in each client to alleviate the unfair competition between classes by constructing a personalized binary classification problem for each class. This may aggravate the class imbalance challenge and thus a novel personalized binary classification loss that incorporates both the under-sampling and hard sample mining strategies is designed.

We first formalize the problem of multi-tenant FL, define multi-tenant FL scenarios, and introduce a vanilla multi-tenant FL system that trains activities sequentially to form baselines. Then, we propose two approaches to optimize multi-tenant FL: 1) activity consolidation merges training activities into one activity with a multi-task architecture; 2) after training it for rounds, activity splitting divides it into groups by employing affinities among activities such that activities within a group have better synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuFL outperforms other methods while consuming 40% less energy.

Since cloud data centers are geo-distributed, content transfer costs vary significantly with different data centers, ie, the cost is high for retrieval from distant data centers and lower for nearby retrievals. Many popular caching algorithms in use today, such as Lru, do not consider cost when making caching decisions, and as a result, suffer from high data transfer costs and increased network congestion.

Effective placement of data centers improves network performance and minimizes clients' perceived latency. The problem of determining the optimal placement of data centers in a large network is a classical uncapacitated -median problem.

Moreover, centralized algorithms are computationally expensive and do not scale well with the size of the network. We propose a fully distributed algorithm with linear complexity to optimize the locations of data centers. The proposed algorithm utilizes an iterative two-step optimization approach. Specifically, in each iteration, it first partitions the whole network into  regions through a distributed partitioning algorithm; then within each region, it determines the local approximate optimal location through a distributed message-passing algorithm. When the underlying network is a tree topology, we show that the overall cost is monotonically decreasing between successive iterations and the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations.

This replacement of electronic switching with optical switching at intermediate nodes, however, presents new challenges for fault detection and localization in reconfigurable all-optical networks. Presently, fault detection and localization techniques, as implemented in SONET/G.709 networks, rely on electronic processing of parity checks at intermediate nodes. If similar techniques are adapted to all-optical reconfigurable networks, optical signals need to be tapped out at intermediate nodes for parity checks. This additional electronic processing would break the all-optical transparency paradigm and thus significantly diminish the cost advantages of all-optical networks. In this thesis, we propose new fault-diagnosis approaches specifically tailored to all-optical networks, with an objective of keeping the diagnostic capital expenditure and the diagnostic operation effort low. Instead of the aforementioned passive monitoring paradigm based on parity checks, we propose a proactive lightpath probing paradigm: optical probing signals are sent along a set of lightpaths in the network, and network state (i.e., failure pattern) is then inferred from testing results of this set of end-to-end lightpath measurements.

By conducting a performance evaluation in trace-driven simulations, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of C2.", "Latest advances in mobile communication networks and the increasing penetration of smart phones are transforming the mobile Internet and are empowering end users with rich mobile experience. However, the limited onboard computing and information/energy storage capabilities of mobile devices are hampering their ability to support the increasingly sophisticated applications demanded by users. The emerging cloud computing technology offers a natural solution to extend the limited capabilities of mobile devices. The resulting new paradigm of mobile cloud computing is being embraced by researchers and practitioners as an exciting new way to extend the capabilities of mobile devices and mobile platforms, which has the potential for profound impacts on the business environment and people's daily life.", "It is the aim of this special section to report on the latest research that explores various aspects of cloud-based mobile media. Through an open call for papers, we received 40 submissions. Fourteen (14) papers were accepted for final publication after two rounds of highly competitive reviews. The final papers were selected on the basis of originality and significance of the technical work, as well as relevance to the theme topic. The papers in this special section span a wide range of novel algorithms, techniques, applications, and system-level solutions. They naturally fall into two categories: addressing existing challenges or exploring emerging opportunities.", "This paper presents the initial results of optimising the use of outside air for cooling modularized data centres (MDCs) under tropical climates. MDCs with outside air-cooling have been in use in temperate climates. The concept was test-bedded in Singapore for the first time at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The initial operation data showed that there is a potential of 73% of time, the data centre can be operated using only outside air or mixture of outside air with warm return air. Here, we analyse the cooling system performance of the MDC test-bed with the aid of energy models and standard weather files to evaluate the possibility of cooling mode control algorithm in the air-handling unit (AHU). The results show that, enthalpy based cooling mode control has the potential of maintaining consistent high-energy efficiency of outside air cooled MDC at low IT loads.", "Due to the road-constrained data delivery and highly dynamic topology of vehicle nodes in a Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET), it is better to construct routing based on the road-to-road pattern than the traditional node-to-node routing pattern in MANETs. However, the challenging issue is the opportunistic forwarding at intersections. Therefore, we propose a novel routing scheme, called Buffer and Switch (BAS). In BAS, each road buffers the data packets with multiple duplicates propagation in order to provide more opportunities for packet switching at intersections. Different from conventional protocols in VANETs, the propagation of duplicates in BAS is bidirectional along the routing path. Moreover, BAS's cost is much lower than other flooding-based protocols due to its spatio-temporally controlled duplicates propagation. Different from recent researches, BAS can deliver packets not only to a stationary node, but also to the stationary or mobile nodes in a specified area. We conduct the extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of BAS based on the road map of a real city collected from Google Earth. The simulation results show that BAS can outperform the existing protocols, especially when the network resources are limited.", "We apply three alternative statistical learning methods to estimate optical transmission impairments (e.g., noises, chromatic dispersion) from synchronous histograms. Linear regression yields good accuracy. A more sophisticated locally weighted regression technique performs better.", "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is one of the most popular and challenging tasks in computer vision. This task is to localize the objects in the images given only the image-level supervision. Recently, dividing WSOL into two parts (class-agnostic object localization and object classification) has become the state-of-the-art pipeline for this task. However, existing solutions under this pipeline usually suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they are not flexible since they can only localize one object for each image due to the adopted single-class regression (SCR) for localization; 2) the generated pseudo bounding boxes may be noisy, but the negative impact of such noise is not well addressed. To remedy these drawbacks, we first propose to replace SCR with a binary-class detector (BCD) for localizing multiple objects, where the detector is trained by discriminating the foreground and background. Then we design a weighted entropy (WE) loss using the unlabeled data to reduce the negative impact of noisy bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the popular CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI) aims to extract causal relations between events in a document. It challenges conventional sentence-level task (SECI) with difficult long-text understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel DECI model (SENDIR) for better document-level reasoning. Different from existing works that build an event graph via linguistic tools, SENDIR does not require any prior knowledge. The basic idea is to discriminate event pairs in the same sentence or span multiple sentences by assuming their different information density: 1) low density in the document suggests sparse attention to skip irrelevant information. Our module 1 designs various types of attention for event representation learning to capture long-distance dependence. 2) High density in a sentence makes SECI relatively easy. Module 2 uses different weights to highlight the roles and contributions of intra-and inter-sentential reasoning, which introduces supportive event pairs for joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate great improvements in SENDIR and the effectiveness of various sparse attention for document-level representations. Codes will be released later.", "This paper considers intelligent data center cooling control via the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to improve data center sustainability. Existing DRL-based controllers are trained with a simplified data hall thermodynamic model which assumes uniform room temperature distribution. This assumption is not valid for a real-world data center with highly nonuniform temperature distribution. Furthermore, most of them cannot guarantee thermal safety during the DRL learning process. To bridge these gaps, we propose LyaSafe, a model-assisted safe DRL approach for data center cooling control. To address the safety evaluation issue, we develop a coupled model that combines a differentiable surrogate data hall thermodynamics model with the energy model. It can simulate both data hall temperature distribution and the facility energy consumption. To address safe learning, we introduce a novel\u00a0\u2026", "A typical task in the field of video understanding is hand action recognition, which has a wide range of applications. Existing works either mainly focus on full-body actions, or the defined action categories are relatively coarse-grained. In this paper, we propose FHA-Kitchens, a novel dataset of fine-grained hand actions in kitchen scenes. In particular, we focus on human hand interaction regions and perform deep excavation to further refine hand action information and interaction regions. Our FHA-Kitchens dataset consists of 2,377 video clips and 30,047 images collected from 8 different types of dishes, and all hand interaction regions in each image are labeled with high-quality fine-grained action classes and bounding boxes. We represent the action information in each hand interaction region as a triplet, resulting in a total of 878 action triplets. Based on the constructed dataset, we benchmark representative action recognition and detection models on the following three tracks: (1) supervised learning for hand interaction region and object detection, (2) supervised learning for fine-grained hand action recognition, and (3) intra- and inter-class domain generalization for hand interaction region detection. The experimental results offer compelling empirical evidence that highlights the challenges inherent in fine-grained hand action recognition, while also shedding light on potential avenues for future research, particularly in relation to pre-training strategy, model design, and domain generalization. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/tingZ123/FHA-Kitchens.", "As energy-intensive entities, data centers are associated with significant environmental impacts, making their sustainability a subject of growing interest in recent years. In this article, we revisit data center sustainability and propose a forward-looking vision for improving data center sustainability. We argue that data center sustainability encompasses more than just energy efficiency and must be evaluated and optimized through a multi-faceted approach. To this end, we first present an overview of the sustainability metrics from five aspects. After that, we demonstrate the sustainability status of the latest data centers utilizing publicly available data center sustainability ratings. Furthermore, we examine the evolution of data center sustainability standards in Singapore to highlight several trending features. Based on the analysis, we identify several key elements of sustainable data centers.

We use correlation-based networks to study the crypto token market and compare the optimal portfolio composed of tokens with that of tokens and stocks. We find that tokens with high Sharp ratios but low centrality can serve as the booster of portfolio performance. In addition, we discover that the token market resembles the stock market in terms of correlation network structure. The market is dominated by tokens from Defi, blockchain infrastructure, and GameFi sectors, and becomes more correlated during market downturns.", "While recent deep learning workload schedulers exhibit excellent performance, it is arduous to deploy them in practice due to some substantial defects, including inflexible intrusive manner, exorbitant integration and maintenance cost, limited scalability, as well as opaque decision processes. Motivated by these issues, we design and implement Lucid, a non-intrusive deep learning workload scheduler based on interpretable models. It consists of three innovative modules. First, a two-dimensional optimized profiler is introduced for efficient job metric collection and timely debugging job feedback. Second, Lucid utilizes an indolent packing strategy to circumvent interference. Third, Lucid orchestrates resources based on estimated job priority values and sharing scores to achieve efficient scheduling.

However, multiple simultaneous FL tasks could overload resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose the first FL system to effectively coordinate and train multiple simultaneous FL tasks. We first formalize the problem of training simultaneous FL tasks. Then, we present our new approach, MAS (Merge and Split), to optimize the performance of training multiple simultaneous FL tasks. MAS starts by merging FL tasks into an all-in-one FL task with a multi-task architecture. After training for a few rounds, MAS splits the all-in-one FL task into two or more FL tasks by using the affinities among tasks measured during the all-in-one training. It then continues training each split of FL tasks based on model parameters from the all-in-one training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAS outperforms other methods while reducing training time by 2x and reducing energy consumption by 40%. We hope this work will inspire the community to further study and optimize training simultaneous FL tasks.", "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving them into high-fidelity and real-time digital twins is desirable for online operations of data centers. However, CFD models often have unsatisfactory accuracy and high computation overhead. Manually calibrating the CFD model parameters is tedious and labor-intensive. Existing automatic calibration approaches apply heuristics to search the model configurations. However, each search step requires a long-lasting process of repeatedly solving the CFD model, rendering them impractical especially for complex CFD models. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that calibrates a CFD model by iterating four steps of i) training a neural surrogate model, ii) finding the optimal parameters through neural surrogate retraining, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD\u00a0\u2026", "Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in deep learning model development that provides better model performance at the cost of substantial resources. While existing systems can improve tuning efficiency, they still fail to handle large models with billions of parameters and efficiently leverage cluster resources. Motivated by these deficiencies, we introduce Hydro, a surrogate-based hyperparameter tuning service that optimizes tuning workloads in both the job-level and cluster-level granularities. Specifically, it consists of two key components:(1) Hydro Tuner automatically generates and optimizes surrogate models via scaling, parametrization and fusion;(2) Hydro Coordinator improves tuning efficiency and cluster-wide resource utilization by adaptively leveraging ephemeral and heterogeneous resources. Our comprehensive experiments on two tuning algorithms across six models show that Hydro Tuner can dramatically reduce tuning makespan by up to 78.5 x compared with Ray Tune and no reduction in tuning quality. Hydro's source code is publicly available at https://github. com/S-Lab-System-Group/Hydro.", "The recent breakthrough of foundation model (FM) research raises a new trend to acquire efficient DL models by fine-tuning FMs with low-resource datasets. Current GPU clusters are mainly established to develop DL models by training from scratch. How to tailor a GPU cluster scheduler for FM fine-tuning workloads is still not explored. We propose Titan, a scheduler to improve the efficiency of FM fine-tuning workloads based on their three distinct features. (1) It takes full advantage of the fixed model structure to estimate the job duration accurately and configure the fine-tuning workload efficiently. (2) The multi-task adaptivity of FMs enables multiple fine-tuning workloads to share the same model parameters, which can significantly reduce the GPU resource consumption.

For this vision to come to pass, significant advances in energy storage technologies such as batteries, which solve the intermittency of renewable energy, need to be achieved. Developing new battery materials with higher capacities and longer lifetimes is thus of paramount importance. Moreover, the intermittency of renewable energy presents a significant challenge to smart grid management. To this end, researchers have begun turning to machine learning (ML) techniques: algorithms that learn from datasets and automatically improve through experience. These can be used to make predictions and informed decisions, which can accelerate the process of materials discovery and systems management. Here we discuss key ML concepts that have guided important developments in battery materials discovery and\u00a0\u2026", "Online recruitment platforms are becoming powerful tools for job hunters to look for jobs and for companies to search for outstanding candidates.

To address these issues, we propose a new deep cycle learning-based framework for talent-job fit. In particular, we first propose a noise-incorporated co-attention mechanism to measure resume consistency in a fine-grained manner. Then a multi-scale CNN is utilized for job representation learning, and the matching score between resume and job is measured via multi-scale attention.

The widely adopted reward shaping approach adds negative reward when the exploratory action results in unsafety. Thus, it needs to experience sufficient unsafe states before it learns how to prevent unsafety. In this paper, we propose a safety-aware DRL framework for data center cooling control. It applies offline imitation learning and online post-hoc rectification to holistically prevent thermal unsafety during online DRL. In particular, the post-hoc rectification searches for the minimum modification to the DRL-recommended action such that the rectified action will not result\u00a0\u2026", "Coolingas a Service (CaaS) is an emerging business that provides air conditioning services for buildings. With the rapid development of the business and the continuous increase of energy load, CaaS providers need cost-effective energy procurement to meet the service requirements. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for energy procurement for CaaS providers. First, we focus on two dominant variables of cooling energy cost, including outdoor temperature and electricity price. We predict their trends in the next day and accordingly, we estimate the energy usage and purchase the energy in the day-ahead energy market, one day before the actual usage. During the real-time operation, we can obtain the actual temperature and price, and we use this information to adjust the quality of service without violating the service standards. The adjustment serves as the demand response to the real-time energy\u00a0\u2026", "Occupant thermal comfort is a pillar of smart buildings.

Quite a lot of efforts have been made to develop various algorithms and applications. However, few studies have considered on how to combine these two technologies together and improve their respective performance. Methods In this paper, we propose to address this issue by answering two questions: 1. How does deep learning benefit blockchain? 2. How does blockchain benefit deep learning? Results For the former, we systematically decompose the blockchain system into five layers, including a network layer, a consensus layer, a data model layer, an execution layer, and an application layer, from bottom to top. In each layer, we introduce the major challenge, and the corresponding deep learning-based approach. For the latter, we discuss the benefits of blockchain, including anonymity, decentralization, security and immutability, which can be utilized to protect data privacy and coordinate distributed control in deep learning applications. Then we devise a unified blockchain based deep learning framework by decoupling the data plane and control plane.

The energy reduction in air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) system of the underground data centre is even more significant for the tropical regions where air is hot and humid all the year round. However, little study has been conducted to systematically analyse the relationship between the air-conditioning effectiveness and the corresponding energy efficiency. In this work, both energy simulations and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted to the underground air-conditioning data centres in the tropics. The former one studies the energy consumption and energy efficiency of the whole ACMV system for a data centre. Meanwhile, the latter one studies the corresponding detailed airflow pattern within the data centre room. Optimizations in air management of the ACMV system are also proposed based on the energy and CFD simulation results.", "This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of economic and pricing models for resource management in cloud networking. To achieve sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction, and flexibility in provisioning of cloud resources, resource management in cloud networking requires adaptive and robust designs to address many issues, eg, resource allocation, bandwidth reservation, request allocation, and workload allocation.

Application off-loading allows the mobile devices to run computation-intensive applications. Such applications include virus scanning [10], face recognition [11], image retrieval [29], optical character recognition [30], mobile gaming [45], rescue missions on robotics [18], and healthcare systems [48]. However, it is not always energy-efficient to off-load mobile applications to the cloud for execution. The stochastic nature of wireless channels and various profiles of mobile applications (eg, task topology and time deadline requirement) present challenges for making decision on application off-loading.Previous works have provided analysis of off-loading decision for coarse-grained applications under static network condition. Kumar and Lu in [28] presented a rough analysis to decide whether to off-load applications to the cloud, mainly considering computation energy on the mobile device and the communication energy for off-loading over the static network.

We run experiments using Taskonomy dataset [6], which is a large and challenging computer vision (CV) dataset of indoor scenes of buildings. To facilitate reproducibility and mitigate computational requirements, we use the tiny split of Taskonomy dataset, 1 whose size is around 445GB. We select nine CV applications to form three sets of FL tasks: sdnkt, erckt, sdnkterca. These nine tasks are also used in [5]. Figure 1 provides sample images of these nine FL tasks.

In existing distributed hash table (DHT) based metadata management systems, the lookup service could be a performance bottleneck due to its significant CPU overhead. Our investigations showed that the lookup service could reduce system throughput by up to 70%, and increase system latency by a factor of up to 8 compared to ideal scenarios. In this paper, we present MetaFlow, a scalable metadata lookup service utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) techniques to distribute lookup workload over network components. MetaFlow tackles the lookup bottleneck problem by leveraging B-tree, which is constructed over the physical topology, to manage flow tables for SDN-enabled switches. Therefore, metadata requests can be forwarded to appropriate servers using only switches. Extensive performance evaluations in both simulations and testbed showed that MetaFlow increases system throughput by a factor of up to 3.2, and reduce system latency by a factor of up to 5 compared to DHT-based systems. We also deployed MetaFlow in a distributed file system, and demonstrated significant performance improvement.", "This supplementary material provides more implementation details and presents more experimental results, including ablation studies on DAPU, batch size, and the number of clients.

In this paper, we propose GraphMP to tackle big graph analytics on a single machine. GraphMP achieves low disk I/O overhead with three techniques. First, we design a vertex-centric sliding window (VSW) computation model to avoid reading and writing vertices on disk. Second, we propose a selective scheduling method to skip loading and processing unnecessary edge shards on disk. Third, we use a compressed edge cache mechanism to fully utilize the available memory of a machine to reduce the amount of disk accesses for edges. Extensive evaluations have shown that GraphMP could outperform existing single-machine out-of-core systems such as GraphChi, X-Stream and GridGraph by up to 30, and can be as highly competitive as distributed graph engines like Pregel+, PowerGraph and Chaos.", "Many cluster management systems (CMSs) have been proposed to share a single cluster with multiple distributed computing systems. However, none of the existing approaches can handle distributed machine learning (ML) workloads given the following criteria: high resource utilization, fair resource allocation and low sharing overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a new CMS named Dorm, incorporating a dynamicallypartitioned cluster management mechanism and an utilizationfairness optimizer. Specifically, Dorm uses the container-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one application per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at application runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for resources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead.

Unlike the traditional methodologies, the key innovation of ML lies with its capability to extract insights and knowledge from the massive amount of data. Data plays an important part in smart city applications. Deployment of sensors, actuators, and smart objects on a city-scale generates a huge amount of data in real-time. With such diverse and large volume of the collected data for smart cities, ML comes in to perform data analytics for system modeling, trend prediction, and intelligence generation [1].ML provides a wide spectrum of algorithms and technologies, each having its unique design philosophy and analysis mechanism.

We propose a family of failure localization algorithms that exploit the unique properties of all-optical networks. Optical probe signals are sequentially sent along a set of designed lightpaths and the network state is inferred from the result of this set of end-to-end measurements. The design objective is to minimize the diagnosis effort (eg, the average number of probes) to locate failures.By establishing a mathematical equivalence between the fault diagnosis problem and the source coding problem in Information Theory, we obtain a tight lower bound for the minimum average number of probes per edge (of the network modeled as a graph) as Hb (p), the entropy of the individual edges. Using the rich set of results from coding theory to solve the fault diagnosis problem, we show that the \u20182m-splitting\u2019probing scheme is optimum for the special case of single failure over a linear network. We then develop a class of near-optimum run-length probing schemes that have low computation complexity. Analytical and numerical results suggest that the average number of probes per edge for the run-length probing scheme is uniformly bounded above by (1+ \u03b5) Hb (p), and converges to the entropy lower bound as the failure probability decreases. From an information theoretic perspective, we show that the run-length probing scheme outperforms the greedy probing scheme of the same computational complexity. The investigation reveals a guideline for efficient fault diagnosis schemes: each probe should provide", "This paper investigates the fault diagnosis of alloptical networks with independent links failures. We propose a family of failure identification algorithms that exploit the unique characteristic of all-optical networks. In particular, optical signals are sequentially sent along a set of lightpaths to probe their state of heath, and the network state is inferred from the set of end-to-end measurements. Using the average number of probes per link as the cost metric, we build the equivalence between the network diagnosis problem and the source coding problem. This equivalence suggests that the average number of probes per link is lower bounded by the information entropy of individual links. We show that it is optimum to probe individual links when the link failure probability is higher than (3-\u221a 5)/2\u2248 0.382 and find that the \u20182m-splitting\u2019probing scheme is optimum for the special case of at most one failure over a linear network\u00a0\u2026"]}}
