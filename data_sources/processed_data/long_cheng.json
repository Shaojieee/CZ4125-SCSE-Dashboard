He received the PhD degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2015 and Bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2010. He has research interests broadly in data management and data mining. Specifically, he works in (a) spatial data management with machine learning-based techniques, (b) spatial data mining in the urban domain (e.g., traffic and mobility), (c) graph data mining (namely dense subgraph mining and graphlet mining), and recently in (d) high-dimensional vector data management (e.g., approximate nearest neighbor search). His research has been recognized with the \"Best Research Award\" provided by ACM-Hong Kong, the \"Fulbright-RGC Research Award\" provided by Research Grant Council (Hong Kong), the \"PG Paper Contest Award\" provided by IEEE-HK, and the \"Overseas Research Award\" provided by HKUST.", "google_scholar": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LybJ7ksAAAAJ", "orcid": null, "github": null, "scopus": null, "web_of_science": null, "other_websites": ["https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long"], "citation_statistics": {"table": {"": ["Citations", "h-index", "i10-index"], "All": ["1868", "25", "45"], "Since 2018": ["1567", "24", "45"]}, "chart": {"2014": 27, "2015": 61, "2016": 78, "2017": 104, "2018": 99, "2019": 118, "2020": 180, "2021": 328, "2022": 395, "2023": 442}}, "interests": ["data management", "data mining"], "num_published": {"2013": 5, "2019": 7, "2011": 1, "2014": 7, "2020": 17, "2021": 23, "2018": 6, "2017": 4, "2022": 18, "2015": 2, "2023": 21, "2024": 1}, "bachelor_degree": null, "masters": null, "phd": null}
