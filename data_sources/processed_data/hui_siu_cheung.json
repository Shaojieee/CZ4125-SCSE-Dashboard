Fuzzy logic can be incorporated to ontology to represent uncertainty information. Typically, fuzzy ontology is generated from a predefined concept hierarchy. However, to construct a concept hierarchy for a certain domain can be a difficult and tedious task. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes the FOGA (fuzzy ontology generation framework) for automatic generation of fuzzy ontology on uncertainty information. The FOGA framework comprises the following components: fuzzy formal concept analysis, concept hierarchy generation, and fuzzy ontology generation. We also discuss approximating reasoning for incremental enrichment of the ontology with new upcoming data. Finally, a fuzzy-based technique for integrating other attributes of database to the ontology is proposed.", "In traditional customer service support of a manufacturing environment, a customer service database usually stores two types of service information: (1) unstructured customer service reports record machine problems and its remedial actions and (2) structured data on sales, employees, and customers for day-to-day management operations. This paper investigates how to apply data mining techniques to extract knowledge from the database to support two kinds of customer service activities: decision support and machine fault diagnosis. A data mining process, based on the data mining tool DBMiner, was investigated to provide structured management data for decision support. In addition, a data mining technique that integrates neural network, case-based reasoning, and rule-based reasoning is proposed; it would search the unstructured customer service records for machine fault diagnosis.

Our model, LRML (Latent Relational Metric Learning) is a novel metric learning approach for recommendation. More specifically, instead of simple push-pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose to learn latent relations that describe each user item interaction. This helps to alleviate the potential geometric inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches. This enables not only better performance but also a greater extent of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn to attend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. The memory-based attention module is controlled by the user-item interaction, making the learned relation vector specific to each user-item pair. Hence, this can be\u00a0\u2026", "Many recent state-of-the-art recommender systems such as D-ATT, TransNet and DeepCoNN exploit reviews for representation learning. This paper proposes a new neural architecture for recommendation with reviews. Our model operates on a multi-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews are created equal, i.e., only a selected few are important. The importance, however, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To this end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that extracts important reviews from user and item reviews and subsequently matches them in a word-by-word fashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for prediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method operates with a gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the incorporation of discrete vectors\u00a0\u2026", "Local differential privacy (LDP) is a recently proposed privacy standard for collecting and analyzing data, which has been used, e.g., in the Chrome browser, iOS and macOS. In LDP, each user perturbs her information locally, and only sends the randomized version to an aggregator who performs analyses, which protects both the users and the aggregator against private information leaks. Although LDP has attracted much research attention in recent years, the majority of existing work focuses on applying LDP to complex data and/or analysis tasks. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem of collecting multidimensional data under LDP has not been addressed sufficiently, and there remains much room for improvement even for basic tasks such as computing the mean value over a single numeric attribute under LDP. Motivated by this, we first propose novel LDP mechanisms for collecting a numeric\u00a0\u2026", "Organizations with a large user base, such as Samsung and Google, can potentially benefit from collecting and mining users' data. However, doing so raises privacy concerns, and risks accidental privacy breaches with serious consequences. Local differential privacy (LDP) techniques address this problem by only collecting randomized answers from each user, with guarantees of plausible deniability; meanwhile, the aggregator can still build accurate models and predictors by analyzing large amounts of such randomized data. So far, existing LDP solutions either have severely restricted functionality, or focus mainly on theoretical aspects such as asymptotical bounds rather than practical usability and performance. Motivated by this, we propose Harmony, a practical, accurate and efficient system for collecting and analyzing data from smart device users, while satisfying LDP. Harmony applies to multi-dimensional data containing both numerical and categorical attributes, and supports both basic statistics (e.g., mean and frequency estimates), and complex machine learning tasks (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression and SVM classification). Experiments using real data confirm Harmony's effectiveness.", "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been actively researched through various approaches, including computational techniques. A review on basic elements of TCM is provided to illuminate various challenges and progresses in its study using computational methods. Information on various TCM formulations, in particular resources on databases of TCM formulations and their integration to Western medicine, are analyzed in several facets, such as TCM classifications, types of databases, and mining tools. Aspects of computational TCM diagnosis, namely inspection, auscultation, pulse analysis as well as TCM expert systems are reviewed in term of their benefits and drawbacks. Various approaches on exploring relationships among TCM components and finding genes/proteins relating to TCM symptom complex are also studied.

While neural network architectures have been successful in predicting the overall polarity of sentences, aspect-specific sentiment analysis still remains as an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for integrating aspect information into the neural model. More specifically, we incorporate aspect information into the neural model by modeling word-aspect relationships. Our novel model, Aspect Fusion LSTM (AF-LSTM) learns to attend based on associative relationships between sentence words and aspect which allows our model to adaptively focus on the correct words given an aspect term. This ameliorates the flaws of other state-of-the-art models that utilize naive concatenations to model word-aspect similarity. Instead, our model adopts circular convolution and circular correlation to model the similarity between aspect and words and elegantly incorporates this within a differentiable neural attention framework. Finally, our model is end-to-end differentiable and highly related to convolution-correlation (holographic like) memories. Our proposed neural model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming ATAE-LSTM by 4%-5% on average across multiple datasets.", "With the proliferation of harmful Internet content such as pornography, violence, and hate messages, effective content-filtering systems are essential. Many Web-filtering systems are commercially available, and potential users can download trial versions from the Internet. However, the techniques these systems use are insufficiently accurate and do not adapt well to the ever-changing Web. To solve this problem, we propose using artificial neural networks to classify Web pages during content filtering. We focus on blocking pornography because it is among the most prolific and harmful Web content. However, our general framework is adaptable for filtering other objectionable Web material.", "The automatic recognition of facial expression presents a significant challenge to the pattern analysis and man-machine interaction research community. Recognition from a single static image is particularly a difficult task. In this paper, we present a methodology for facial expression recognition from a single static image using line-based caricatures. The recognition process is completely automatic. It also addresses the computational expensive problem and is thus suitable for real-time applications. The proposed approach uses structural and geometrical features of a user sketched expression model to match the line edge map (LEM) descriptor of an input face image. A disparity measure that is robust to expression variations is defined. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and promising results are obtained. This work has proven the proposed idea that facial expressions can be\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents a new deep learning architecture for Natural Language Inference (NLI). Firstly, we introduce a new architecture where alignment pairs are compared, compressed and then propagated to upper layers for enhanced representation learning. Secondly, we adopt factorization layers for efficient and expressive compression of alignment vectors into scalar features, which are then used to augment the base word representations. The design of our approach is aimed to be conceptually simple, compact and yet powerful. We conduct experiments on three popular benchmarks, SNLI, MultiNLI and SciTail, achieving competitive performance on all. A lightweight parameterization of our model also enjoys a  times reduction in parameter size compared to the existing state-of-the-art models, e.g., ESIM and DIIN, while maintaining competitive performance. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our propagated features are highly interpretable.", "Author co-citation analysis (ACA) has been widely used in bibliometrics as an analytical method in analyzing the intellectual structure of science studies. It can be used to identify authors from the same or similar research fields. However, such analysis method relies heavily on statistical tools to perform the analysis and requires human interpretation. Web Citation Database is a data warehouse used for storing citation indices of Web publications. In this paper, we propose a mining process to automate the ACA based on the Web Citation Database. The mining process uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) as the mining technique for author clustering and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for displaying author cluster maps. The clustering results and author cluster map have been incorporated into a citation-based retrieval system known as PubSearch to support author retrieval of Web publications.", "Sarcasm is a sophisticated speech act which commonly manifests on social communities such as Twitter and Reddit. The prevalence of sarcasm on the social web is highly disruptive to opinion mining systems due to not only its tendency of polarity flipping but also usage of figurative language. Sarcasm commonly manifests with a contrastive theme either between positive-negative sentiments or between literal-figurative scenarios. In this paper, we revisit the notion of modeling contrast in order to reason with sarcasm. More specifically, we propose an attention-based neural model that looks in-between instead of across, enabling it to explicitly model contrast and incongruity. We conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from Twitter, Reddit and the Internet Argument Corpus. Our proposed model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets but also enjoys improved interpretability.", "The dominant neural architectures in question answer retrieval are based on recurrent or convolutional encoders configured with complex word matching layers. Given that recent architectural innovations are mostly new word interaction layers or attention-based matching mechanisms, it seems to be a well-established fact that these components are mandatory for good performance. Unfortunately, the memory and computation cost incurred by these complex mechanisms are undesirable for practical applications. As such, this paper tackles the question of whether it is possible to achieve competitive performance with simple neural architectures. We propose a simple but novel deep learning architecture for fast and efficient question-answer ranking and retrieval. More specifically, our proposed model, HyperQA, is a parameter efficient neural network that outperforms other parameter intensive models such as\u00a0\u2026", "We describe a new deep learning architecture for learning to rank question answer pairs. Our approach extends the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with holographic composition to model the relationship between question and answer representations. As opposed to the neural tensor layer that has been adopted recently, the holographic composition provides the benefits of scalable and rich representational learning approach without incurring huge parameter costs. Overall, we present Holographic Dual LSTM (HD-LSTM), a unified architecture for both deep sentence modeling and semantic matching. Essentially, our model is trained end-to-end whereby the parameters of the LSTM are optimized in a way that best explains the correlation between question and answer representations. In addition, our proposed deep learning architecture requires no extensive feature engineering.

In this paper, we describe a new neural architecture that enhances vanilla neural network models with auxiliary neural coherence features. Our new method proposes a new SkipFlow mechanism that models relationships between snapshots of the hidden representations of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network as it reads. Subsequently, the semantic relationships between multiple snapshots are used as auxiliary features for prediction. This has two main benefits. Firstly, essays are typically long sequences and therefore the memorization capability of the LSTM network may be insufficient. Implicit access to multiple snapshots can alleviate this problem by acting as a protection against vanishing gradients. The parameters of the SkipFlow mechanism also acts as an auxiliary memory. Secondly, modeling relationships between multiple positions allows our model to learn features that represent and approximate textual coherence. In our model, we call this neural coherence features. Overall, we present a unified deep learning architecture that generates neural coherence features as it reads in an end-to-end fashion. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark ASAP dataset, outperforming not only feature engineering baselines but also other deep learning models.", "To provide intelligent personalized online services such as Web recommendations, it is usually necessary to model users' Web access behavior. To achieve this, one of the promising approaches is Web usage mining, which mines Web logs for user models and recommendations. Different from most Web recommender systems that are mainly based on clustering and association rule mining, this paper proposes an intelligent Web recommender system known as SWARS (sequential Web access-based recommender system) that uses sequential access pattern mining. In the proposed system, CS-mine, an efficient sequential pattern mining algorithm is used to identify frequent sequential Web access patterns. The access patterns are then stored in a compact tree structure, called Pattern-tree, which is then used for matching and generating Web links for recommendations. In this paper, the proposed SWARS system\u00a0\u2026", "This paper proposes a new fuzzy FCA-based approach to conceptual clustering for automatic generation of concept hierarchy on uncertainty data.

Next, a fuzzy conceptual clustering technique is proposed to cluster the fuzzy concept lattice into conceptual clusters. Then, hierarchical relations are generated among conceptual clusters for constructing the concept hierarchy.

The performance of the proposed approach is also discussed in the paper.", "Summary writing is an important part of many English Language Examinations. As grading students\u2019 summary writings is a very time-consuming task, computer-assisted assessment will help teachers carry out the grading more effectively. Several techniques such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), n-gram co-occurrence and BLEU have been proposed to support automatic evaluation of summaries. However, their performance is not satisfactory for assessing summary writings. To improve the performance, this paper proposes an ensemble approach that integrates LSA and n-gram co-occurrence. As a result, the proposed ensemble approach is able to achieve high accuracy and improve the performance quite substantially compared with current techniques. A summary assessment system based on the proposed approach has also been developed.", "This paper proposes Dyadic Memory Networks (DyMemNN), a novel extension of end-to-end memory networks (memNN) for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Originally designed for question answering tasks, memNN operates via a memory selection operation in which relevant memory pieces are adaptively selected based on the input query. In the problem of ABSA, this is analogous to aspects and documents in which the relationship between each word in the document is compared with the aspect vector. In the standard memory networks, simple dot products or feed forward neural networks are used to model the relationship between aspect and words which lacks representation learning capability. As such, our dyadic memory networks ameliorates this weakness by enabling rich dyadic interactions between aspect and word embeddings by integrating either parameterized neural tensor compositions\u00a0\u2026", "Taxonomic relation identification aims to recognize the \u2018is-a\u2019relation between two terms. Previous works on identifying taxonomic relations are mostly based on statistical and linguistic approaches, but the accuracy of these approaches is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised learning approach for identifying taxonomic relations using term embeddings. For this purpose, we first design a dynamic weighting neural network to learn term embeddings based on not only the hypernym and hyponym terms, but also the contextual information between them. We then apply such embeddings as features to identify taxonomic relations using a supervised method. The experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 9% to 13% in terms of accuracy for both general and specific domain datasets.", "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this research is to study the characteristics of chat messages from analysing a collection of 33,121 sample messages gathered from 1,700 sessions of conversations of 72 pairs of MSN Messenger users over a four month duration from June to September of 2005.

In this research, we propose the Scholarly Semantic Web for the sharing, reuse and management of scholarly information. To support the Scholarly Semantic Web, we need to construct ontology from data which is a tedious and difficult task. To generate ontology automatically, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is an effective technique that can formally abstract data as conceptual structures. To enable FCA to deal with uncertainty in data and interpret the concept hierarchy reasonably, we propose to incorporate fuzzy logic into FCA for automatic generation of ontology. The proposed new framework is known as Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA). In this paper, we will discuss the Scholarly Semantic Web, and the ontology generation process from the FFCA framework.

We propose a curriculum learning (CL) based Pointer-Generator framework for reading/sampling over large documents, enabling diverse training of the neural model based on the notion of alternating contextual difficulty. This can be interpreted as a form of domain randomization and/or generative pretraining during training. To this end, the usage of the Pointer-Generator softens the requirement of having the answer within the context, enabling us to construct diverse training samples for learning. Additionally, we propose a new Introspective Alignment Layer (IAL), which reasons over decomposed alignments using block-based self-attention. We evaluate our proposed method on the NarrativeQA reading comprehension benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance, improving existing baselines by  relative improvement on BLEU-4 and  relative improvement on Rouge-L. Extensive ablations confirm the effectiveness of our proposed IAL and CL components.", "It is important to know the presence of other concurrently online users before real-time communication can be established with them. While many instant messaging (IM) systems are available, there is no standard protocol for online presence notification due to the proprietary nature of such systems. These systems generally have many security weaknesses such as anonymous messaging, message spoofing, account hijacking and authorization overriding because they depend heavily on client-side operations. This paper proposes an open protocol for online presence notification that also provides negotiation support for real-time communication services. The open nature of the protocol promotes interoperability, but demands higher levels of security than proprietary ones. The separation of instant messaging from online presence notification also distinguishes this open protocol from others.

Our approach performs a series of soft attention operations, each time casting a scalar feature upon the inner word embeddings. The key idea is to provide a real-valued hint (feature) to a subsequent encoder layer and is targeted at improving the representation learning process. There are several advantages to this design, e.g., it allows an arbitrary number of attention mechanisms to be casted, allowing for multiple attention types (e.g., co-attention, intra-attention) and attention variants (e.g., alignment-pooling, max\u00a0\u2026", "In traditional help desk service centres, service engineers provide a world-wide customer support service through the use of long-distance telephone calls.

In particular, a fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA)-based approach is developed for automatic generation of fuzzy machine service ontology that can deal with uncertain information.

Using the analysis of pornographic web pages as a case study, we present an intelligent bilingual web page categorization engine that can determine if an English or Chinese language web page contains pornographic materials. We have implemented the categorization engine to perform offline web page analysis and near-instantaneous online filtering. Performance evaluation of our system has verified its effectiveness.", "Web surfing has become a popular activity for many consumers who not only make purchases online, but also seek relevant information on products and services before they commit to buy. The authors propose a web recommender that models user habits and behaviors by constructing a knowledge base using temporal web access patterns as input. Fuzzy logic is applied to represent real-life temporal concepts and requested resources of periodic pattern-based web access activities. The fuzzy representation is used to construct a knowledge base of the user's web access habits and behaviors, which is used to provide timely personalized recommendations to the user.

Fuzzy Conceptual Clustering then constructs the concept hierarchy from the fuzzy concept lattice. Finally, Fuzzy Ontology Generation generates the fuzzy ontology from the concept hierarchy.

This paper proposes a series of lightweight and memory efficient neural architectures for a potpourri of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To this end, our models exploit computation using Quaternion algebra and hypercomplex spaces, enabling not only expressive inter-component interactions but also significantly () reduced parameter size due to lesser degrees of freedom in the Hamilton product. We propose Quaternion variants of models, giving rise to new architectures such as the Quaternion attention Model and Quaternion Transformer. Extensive experiments on a battery of NLP tasks demonstrates the utility of proposed Quaternion-inspired models, enabling up to  reduction in parameter size without significant loss in performance.", "Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space. Specifically, \"fully-connected layers with Quaternions\" (4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of Quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily  learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject verb agreement demonstrate architectural flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "Traditional help desk service relies heavily on the expertise of service personnel.

To this end, we propose novel Bidirectional Attention Connectors (BAC) for efficiently forging connections throughout the network. We conduct extensive experiments on four challenging RC benchmarks.

Recent works in this area of knowledge graph embeddings such as TransE, TransH and TransR have shown extremely competitive and promising results in relational learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of the translational embedding model to solve three main problems of the current models. Firstly, translational models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as margin and learning rate. Secondly, the translation principle only allows one spot in vector space for each golden triplet. Thus, congestion of entities and relations in vector space may reduce precision. Lastly, the current models are not able to handle dynamic data especially the introduction of new unseen entities/relations or removal of triplets. In this paper, we propose Parallel Universe TransE (puTransE), an adaptable and robust adaptation of the translational model. Our approach non-parametrically estimates the energy score of a triplet from multiple embedding spaces of structurally and semantically aware triplet selection. Our proposed approach is simple, robust and parallelizable. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms TransE and many other embedding methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs on both public benchmark dataset and a real world dynamic dataset.", "Associative classification (AC), which is based on association rules, has shown great promise over many other classification techniques. To implement AC effectively, we need to tackle the problems on the very large search space of candidate rules during the rule discovery process and incorporate the discovered association rules into the classification process. This paper proposes a new approach that we call artificial immune system-associative classification (AIS-AC), which is based on AIS, for mining association rules effectively for classification. Instead of massively searching for all possible association rules, AIS-AC will only find a subset of association rules that are suitable for effective AC in an evolutionary manner. In this paper, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed AIS-AC approach for AC based on large datasets. The performance results have shown that the proposed approach is efficient in\u00a0\u2026", "One of the key remaining problems in face recognition is that of handling the variability in appearance due to changes in pose.

It addresses the computationally expensive problem of current generic 3-D model pose recovery methods and thus is able to be applied in real-time applications. Compared with the virtual view methods, the face identification system with the proposed pose recovery method demands much less storage space as it transforms the 2-D rotated face to the 2-D fronto-parallel view for subsequent identification rather than generating multiple virtual views for a single input face. Experiments evaluating the effectiveness of the technique are reported. The systems are compared with human performances and existing techniques.", "The relationships between consumer emotions and their buying behaviors have been well documented.

We use fuzzy logic to represent real-life temporal concepts (e.g., morning) and requested resource attributes (ontological domain concepts for the requested URLs) of periodic pattern-based web access activities.

In the proposed approach, math expressions are first converted into the corresponding MathML representation, from which math features are extracted. Next, the extracted features are used to construct a mathematical concept lattice.

More recent algorithms that are based on the Web Access Pattern tree (or WAP-tree) can achieve an order of magnitude faster than traditional Apriori-like sequential pattern mining techniques. However, the use of conditional search strategies in WAP-tree based mining algorithms requires re-construction of large numbers of intermediate conditional WAP-trees during mining process, which is also very costly.

Co-Attention enables the learning of pairwise attentions, ie, learning to attend based on computing word-level affinity scores between two documents. However, text matching problems can exist in either symmetrical or asymmetrical domains. For example, paraphrase identification is a symmetrical task while question-answer matching and entailment classification are considered asymmetrical domains. In this paper, we argue that Co-Attention models in asymmetrical domains require different treatment as opposed to symmetrical domains, ie, a concept of word-level directionality should be incorporated while learning word-level similarity scores. Hence, the standard inner product in real space commonly adopted in co-attention is not suitable. This paper leverages attractive properties of the complex vector space and proposes a co-attention mechanism based on the complex-valued inner product (Hermitian products). Unlike the real dot product, the dot product in complex space is asymmetric because the first item is conjugated. Aside from modeling and encoding directionality, our proposed approach also enhances the representation learning process. Extensive experiments on five text matching benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "You can build an effective palmprint verification system using a combination of mostly off-the-shelf components and techniques.

Based on the personal Web usage lattice, resources that the user is most probably interested in during a given period can be deduced efficiently. This approach enables the costly personalized resources preparation process to be done in advance rather than in real-time. The performance evaluation of the proposed periodic Web personalization approach is also given in the paper", "Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), which is based on ordered lattice theory, is applied to mine association rules from web logs.

In recurrent models such as the long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal gates control the amount of information retained or discarded over time, not only playing an important role in influencing the learned representations but also serving as a protection against vanishing gradients. This paper explores the idea of learning temporal gates for sequence pairs (question and answer), jointly influencing the learned representations in a pairwise manner. In our approach, temporal gates are learned via 1D convolutional layers and then subsequently cross applied across question and answer for joint learning. Empirically, we show that this conceptually simple sharing of temporal gates can lead to competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. Intuitively, what our network achieves can be interpreted as learning representations of question and answer pairs that are aware of what each other is remembering or forgetting, ie, pairwise temporal gating. Via extensive experiments, we show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two community-based QA datasets and competitive performance on one factoid-based QA dataset.", "The discovery of frequent itemsets is a fundamental task of association rule mining. The challenge is the computational complexity of the itemset search space. One of the solutions for this is to use constraints to focus on some specific itemsets.

The reference lines are detected by searching for suitable peaks in the Hough transformation space of these points.

This task enables many potential applications such as question answering and paraphrase identification. This paper proposes Co-Stack Residual Affinity Networks (CSRAN), a new and universal neural architecture for this problem. CSRAN is a deep architecture, involving stacked (multi-layered) recurrent encoders. Stacked/Deep architectures are traditionally difficult to train, due to the inherent weaknesses such as difficulty with feature propagation and vanishing gradients. CSRAN incorporates two novel components to take advantage of the stacked architecture. Firstly, it introduces a new bidirectional alignment mechanism that learns affinity weights by fusing sequence pairs across stacked hierarchies. Secondly, it leverages a multi-level attention refinement component between stacked recurrent layers. The key intuition is that, by leveraging information across all network hierarchies, we can not only improve gradient flow but also improve overall performance.

CFC also aggressively prune terms that appear across all classes, discarding some non-exclusive but useful terms. To overcome these CFC limitations while retaining its intrinsic and worthy design goals, we propose an improved centroid-based classifier that uses precise term-class distribution properties instead of presence or absence of terms in classes.

To tackle these problems, we propose a progressive structural analysis (PSA) approach for dynamic recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions.

However, WAP-mine requires re-constructing large numbers of intermediate conditional WAP-trees during mining, which is also very costly. In this paper, we propose an efficient WAP-tree mining algorithm, known as CS-mine (Conditional Sequence mining algorithm), which is based directly on the initial conditional sequence base of each frequent event and eliminates the need for re-constructing intermediate conditional WAP-trees. This can improve significantly on efficiency comparing with WAP-mine, especially when the support threshold becomes smaller and the size of database gets larger.", "In this paper, we propose a fuzzy FCA (formal concept analysis) based approach to conceptual clustering for citation-based document retrieval. In the proposed approach, fuzzy logic is first incorporated into FCA to form a fuzzy concept lattice that can handle vague and uncertain information. A fuzzy conceptual clustering technique is then performed to cluster the fuzzy concept lattice into conceptual clusters and construct a concept hierarchy. Fuzzy query can then be formulated for document retrieval. The proposed fuzzy FCA-based approach has been applied to a citation database for fuzzy document retrieval. The performance of the citation-based document retrieval system is evaluated and presented in the paper.", "The ISO STEP specifications aim to provide an effective means by which product information can be shared and exchanged between applications and enterprises.

Today, many romantic partnerships originate from the Internet, signifying the importance of technology and the web in modern dating. In this paper, we present a text-based computational approach for estimating the relationship compatibility of two users on social media. Unlike many previous works that propose reciprocal recommender systems for online dating websites, we devise a distant supervision heuristic to obtain real world couples from social platforms such as Twitter. Our approach, the CoupleNet is an end-to-end deep learning basedestimator that analyzes the social profiles of two users and subsequently performs a similarity match between the users. Intuitively, our approach performs both user profiling and match-making within a unified end-to-end framework. CoupleNet utilizes hierarchical recurrent neural models for learning representations of user profiles and subsequently coupled attention mechanisms to fuse information aggregated from two users. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first data-driven deep learning approach for our novel relationship recommendation problem. We benchmarkour CoupleNet against several machine learning and deep learning baselines. Experimental results show that our approach outperformsall approaches significantly in terms of precision. Qualitative analysis shows that our model is capable of also producing explainable results to users.", "Web-based testing has become a ubiquitous self-assessment method for online learning. One useful feature that is missing from today's web-based testing systems is the reliable capability to fulfill different assessment requirements of students based on a large-scale question data set. A promising approach for supporting large-scale web-based testing is static test generation (STG), which generates a test paper automatically according to user specification based on multiple assessment criteria. And the generated test paper can then be attempted over the web by users for assessment purpose. Generating high-quality test papers under multiobjective constraints is a challenging task. It is a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) that is not only NP-hard but also need to be solved efficiently.

In the prediction phase, the label of a test document vector is assigned to that of its nearest class prototype. Recently there has been revived interest in reformulating the prototype/centroid to improve classification performance. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the recently proposed Class Feature Centroid (CFC) classifier by considering the rate of change of each prototype vector with respect to individual dimensions (terms). The implication of our theoretical finding is that CFC is inherently biased towards large (dominant majority) classes, which means it is destined to perform poorly for highly class-imbalanced data. Another practical concern about CFC lies in its overly-aggressive design in weeding out terms that appear in\u00a0\u2026", "Discovering and understanding Web users' surfing behavior are essential for the development of successful Web monitoring and recommendation systems.

Machine learning techniques are then applied to a tongue dataset. In performance analysis, we use the Weka machine learning environment for conducting the experiment. Five different machine learning algorithms including ID3, J48, Naive Bayes, BayesNet and SMO are used and applied to a tongue dataset of 457 instances.

The sequence labeling-based NER models do not perform well in recognizing long entities as they focus only on word-level information, while the segment-based NER models which focus on processing segment instead of single word are unable to capture the word-level dependencies within the segment. Moreover, as boundary detection and type prediction may cooperate with each other for the NER task, it is also important for the two sub-tasks to mutually reinforce each other by sharing their information. In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Interaction Network (MIN) model which utilizes both segment-level information and word-level dependencies, and incorporates an interaction mechanism to support information sharing between boundary detection and type prediction to enhance the performance for the NER task. We have conducted extensive experiments based on three NER benchmark datasets. The performance results have shown that the proposed MIN model has outperformed the current state-of-the-art models.", "Instant Messaging (IM) is a peer-to-peer service for remote users to communicate with each others. There are many IM systems such as MSN Messenger and Yahoo Messenger which are used by millions of users everyday.

To help enforce legitimate contents communicated in chat environments, IM monitoring systems have been developed for monitoring chat messages. Although most of these systems can provide good monitoring functions, they only provide simple message analysis features such as browsing and simple keyword-based searching of the recorded messages. In this paper, we propose a system, called IMAnalysis, that supports intelligent chat message analysis using text mining techniques\u00a0\u2026", "Attentional models are distinctly characterized by their ability to learn relative importance, ie, assigning a different weight to input values.

This is strongly contrasted with vanilla attention, which simply re-weights input tokens. Our proposed\\textit {Compositional De-Attention}(CoDA) is fundamentally built upon the intuition of both similarity and dissimilarity (negative affinity) when computing affinity scores, benefiting from a greater extent of expressiveness.

This paper proposes a recurrently controlled recurrent network (RCRN) for expressive and powerful sequence encoding. More concretely, the key idea behind our approach is to learn the recurrent gating functions using recurrent networks. Our architecture is split into two components-a controller cell and a listener cell whereby the recurrent controller actively influences the compositionality of the listener cell. We conduct extensive experiments on a myriad of tasks in the NLP domain such as sentiment analysis (SST, IMDb, Amazon reviews, etc.), question classification (TREC), entailment classification (SNLI, SciTail), answer selection (WikiQA, TrecQA) and reading comprehension (NarrativeQA). Across all 26 datasets, our results demonstrate that RCRN not only consistently outperforms BiLSTMs but also stacked BiLSTMs, suggesting that our controller architecture might be a suitable replacement for the widely adopted stacked architecture. Additionally, RCRN achieves state-of-the-art results on several well-established datasets.", "The World Wide Web has become an important medium for disseminating scientific publications.

FMs are characterized by its usage of the inner product of factorized parameters to model pairwise feature interactions, making it highly expressive and powerful. This paper proposes Holographic Factorization Machines (HFM), a new novel method of enhancing the representation capability of FMs without increasing its parameter size. Our approach replaces the inner product in FMs with holographic reduced representations (HRRs), which are theoretically motivated by associative retrieval and compressed outer products. Empirically, we found that this leads to consistent improvements over vanilla FMs by up to 4% improvement in terms of mean squared error, with improvements larger at smaller parameterization. Additionally, we propose a neural adaptation of HFM which enhances its capability to handle nonlinear structures. We conduct extensive experiments on nine publicly available datasets for collaborative filtering with explicit feedback. HFM achieves state-of-theart performance on all nine, outperforming strong competitors such as Attentional Factorization Machines (AFM) and Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF).", "This paper proposes a new neural architecture that exploits readily available sentiment lexicon resources.

Conceptual association rules can convey more semantic meanings than those classical association rules. Conceptual association rules can be mined using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). However, the FCA-based method for conceptual rule mining suffers from high computational cost when dealing with large datasets. To tackle this problem, we propose a cluster-based approach to mine conceptual association rules regionally, rather than globally.

While solution definitely exists (evidenced by the fact that we do hold classes), an automated optimal schedule is very difficult to derive at present. There were successful attempts to address this problem using heuristics search methods. However, until now, university timetabling is still largely done by hand, because a typical university setting requires numerous customized complicated constraints that are difficult to model or automate.

Recently, there has been specific interest in adapting advanced computer techniques in the field of document retrieval. The most recent attempt investigates the possibility of applying the neural-network paradigm as a means of providing end-users with a more powerful retrieval mechanism. Most of the work done thus far has been focused on incorporating neural networks into the existing classical retrieval methods.

In this approach, Indexing Agents search and download scientific publications from web sites that typically include academic web pages, then they extract citations and store them in a Web Citation Database. In addition, researcher information is also saved into the Researcher Database. Data mining techniques are applied to the Web Citation Database on citation keywords and authors to form document clusters and author clusters.

Information over the Web can be retrieved by searching and browsing. Although existing search engines are powerful in helping users to locate and find information of interest, they do not support tracking changes on behalf of users or delivering timely personalized information to users. In addition, existing monitoring tools either work on a specific domain, or do not provide a user-friendly environment to support users monitor the information that they are interested. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a Web-monitoring model that can help users to specify Web information in a user-friendly environment.

Proposes a Web citation\u2010based retrieval system, known as PubSearch, for the retrieval of Web publications. PubSearch indexes Web publications based on citation indices and stores them into a Web Citation Database. The Web Citation Database is then mined to support publication retrieval.

However, the current chemical structural retrieval methods have focused mainly on finding chemicals with similar structures to the input chemical structural query, and tend to ignore the functional features which are important for determining the chemical property and activity of the chemicals. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based approach for chemical structural retrieval. The proposed lattice-based approach is based on Formal Concept Analysis.

In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-objective optimization approach based on the divide-and-conquer memetic algorithm (DAC-MA) for Online-TPG. Instead of solving the multi-objective constraints simultaneously, the set of constraints is divided into two subsets of relevant constraints, which can then be solved separately and effectively by evolutionary computation and local search of DAC-MA.

This paper proposes one such system, the Web access monitoring and filtering (WAMF) system. The WAMF system comprises two main decoupled components, one for online monitoring and filtering, and the other for offline Web classification and data analysis. The former tracks, tallies, and selectively blocks user Web access in real-time, whereas the latter employs Web mining techniques to classify Web pages into pre-defined user categories and analyze user Web access data for user behavior patterns.

In particular, nested entities are commonly existed in real-life textual data for the NER task. However, the current span-based methods for nested NER are computationally expensive, lacking of explicit boundary supervision and generating many negative samples for span classification, which affect their overall performance. In this paper, we propose a Segment Enhanced Span-based model for nested NER (SESNER). The proposed model treats the nested NER task as a segment covering problem. First, it models entities as segments, detects the segment endpoints and identifies the positional relationship between neighboring endpoints. Then, it detects the outermost segments to generate candidate entity spans nested in it for span classification.

In our approach, gating functions are learned by modeling relationships and reasoning over multi-granular sequence information, enabling compositional learning that is aware of both long and short term information. We conduct experiments on three RC datasets, showing that our proposed encoder demonstrates very promising results both as a standalone encoder as well as a complementary building block. Empirical results show that simple Bi-Attentive architectures augmented with our proposed encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art/highly competitive results but is also considerably faster than other published works.", "Mathematical formulas or expressions are essential for presenting scientific knowledge in many research documents in academic areas such as physics and mathematics. Searching for related mathematical formulas is an important but challenging problem as formulas contain both structural and semantic information. Such information is hidden inside the mathematical expressions of the formulas.

In this paper, we propose an effective approach for formula feature extraction. To evaluate the proposed approach, the extracted features are tested with three popular clustering algorithms, namely K-means, Self Organizing Map (SOM), and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), for formula retrieval.

An approach for estimating the prediction confidence of a rule is also given. The use of prediction confidence instead of confidence measure helps gather better association rules for associative classification. As a result, a more accurate associative classifier can be constructed using the prediction confidence measure.", "Standards are important to the growth and acceptance of emerging industries such as the biometric industry.

English grammar is one of the important components in learning English. To learn English grammar effectively, it requires students to practice questions containing focused grammar knowledge. In this paper, we study a novel problem of retrieving English grammar questions with similar grammatical focus. Since the grammatical focus similarity is different from textual similarity or sentence syntactic similarity, existing approaches cannot be applied directly to our problem. To address this problem, we propose a syntactic based approach for English grammar question retrieval which can retrieve related grammar questions with similar grammatical focus effectively.

The proposed approach can progressively generate the recognition result after recognizing each symbol and users can make any corrections to the recognition result immediately. In addition, the proposed approach can recognize both cyclic and non-cyclic chemical structures.

However, there exists little research on math topic classification. Math documents contain both textual data and math expressions. The text and math can be considered as two related but different views of a math document. The goal of online math topic classification is to automatically categorize a math document containing both mathematical expressions and textual content into an appropriate topic without the need for periodically retraining the classifier. To achieve this, it is essential to have a two-view online classification algorithm, which deals with the textual data view and the math expression view at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive two-view online math document classifier based on the Passive Aggressive (PA) algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated\u00a0\u2026", "We propose a two-view online learning algorithm that utilizes two different views of the same data to achieve something that is greater than the sum of its parts. Our algorithm is an extension of the single-view Passive Aggressive (PA) algorithm, where we minimize the changes in the two view weights and disagreements between the two classifiers. The final classifier is an equally weighted sum of the individual classifiers. As a result, disagreements between the two views are tolerated as long as the final combined classifier output is not compromised. Our approach thus allows the stronger voice (view) to dominate whenever the two views disagree. This additional allowance of diversity between the two views is what gives our approach the edge, as espoused by classical ensemble learning theory.

Online-TPG is challenging as it is a multi-objective optimization problem on constraint satisfaction that is NP-hard, and it is also required to satisfy the online runtime requirement. The current techniques such as dynamic programming, tabu search, swarm intelligence and biologically inspired algorithms are ineffective for Online-TPG as these techniques generally require long runtime for generating good quality test papers.

Currently, the most common way of searching and retrieving information from digital libraries is still by means of keyword-based queries. Over the past many years, there have been many attempts to enhance the query formalism to allow users to retrieve information in a more effective manner. Among them, natural query that is expressed using natural language is obviously the most natural form of search requests. However, typical NLP techniques for natural query retrieval suffer from high cost of complexity. In addition, they are also not very effective when dealing with grammatically imprecise search requests.

In this paper, we investigate AIS, and in particular the clonal selection algorithm for Associative Classification (AC). To implement associative classification effectively, we need to tackle the problems on the very large search space of candidate rules during the rule mining process. This paper proposes a new approach known as AIS-AC for mining association rules effectively for classification. In AIS-AC, we treat the rule mining process as an optimization problem of finding an optimal set of association rules according to some predefined constraints. The proposed AIS-AC approach is efficient in dealing with the complexity problem on the large search space of rules.

The WAX system comprises two gateways, namely, the Fax\u2010In and the Fax\u2010Out Gateways. The Fax\u2010In Gateway accepts fax messages over Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and stores them in a transit database.

In chemical skeletal structural formulas, the Carbon atoms are omitted in the drawing of chemical connected bonds, in which the single bonds are connected with hidden Carbon atoms as the connection points. To recognize chemical skeletal structural formulas, it is important to recognize the connected bond strokes and differentiate them from other similar symbols. Moreover, even if the connected bond stroke is identified, it is also challenging to split the connected bond stroke into several single bonds and identify the locations of the hidden Carbon atoms, and its positional relationship in the overall chemical structure. In this paper, we propose a progressive approach for recognizing chemical skeletal structural formulas, in particular the connected bonds\u00a0\u2026", "Automatic mathematical solution assessment checks the equivalence of mathematical expressions in the user answer and standard solution. It is a challenging problem as the semantics of mathematical expressions are highly symbolic and equivalent mathematical expressions can be expressed in different forms.

The proposed PEV approach is a randomized method based on the probabilistic numerical equivalence testing of two mathematical expressions.

However, one of the major problems of using association rule mining for associative classification is the very large search space of possible rules which usually leads to a very complex rule discovery process. This paper proposes a multiple-step rule discovery approach for associative classification called Mstep-AC. The proposed Mstep-AC approach focuses on discovering effective rules for data samples that might cause misclassification in order to enhance classification accuracy. Although the rule discovery process in Mstep-AC is performed multiple times to mine effective rules, its complexity is comparable with conventional associative classification approach.

With the advancement of internet technologies, customer services nowadays are supported through web-based systems. More recently, rapid development of the semantic web and semantic web services has prompted us to develop a semantic help-desk for supporting customer services over the semantic web environment, which is presented in this paper. In particular, a fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA)-based approach is developed for automatic generation of fuzzy machine service ontology that can deal with uncertain information. The proposed automatic fuzzy ontology generation technique consists of the following steps: fuzzy formal concept analysis, fuzzy conceptual clustering, and ontology generation. As such, the supporting machine services provided by the proposed system will potentially improve customer satisfaction in terms of reducing machine down time and increasing productivity.

To discover web information, web users need to constantly monitor certain web sites and web pages for related information. However, the dynamic nature of the web has made such monitoring task complicated and time-consuming. As most web pages organize its information in a structured manner, users may be interested in only a certain part of a web page rather than the whole web page.

In this paper, we propose an effective Content-based Collaborative Filtering (CCF) approach for automatic calibration of question difficulty degree. In the proposed approach, a dataset of questions with available user responses and knowledge features is first gathered. Next, collaborative filtering is used to predict unknown user responses from known responses of questions. With all the responses, the difficulty degree of each question in the dataset is then estimated using IRT.

Association rule mining searches for interesting relationships amongst items for a given dataset based mainly on the support and confidence measures. Support is used for filtering out infrequent rules, while confidence measures the implication relationships from a set of items to one another. However, one of the main drawbacks of the confidence measure is that it presents the absolute value of implication that does not reflect truthfully the relationships amongst items. For example, if two items have a very high frequency, then they will probably form a rule with a high confidence even if there is no relationship between them at all. In this paper, we propose a new measure known as relative confidence for mining association rules, which is able to reflect truthfully the relationships of items.

In the absence of existing automatic Chinese thesauri, techniques used in English thesaurus generation have been evaluated and adapted to generate a Chinese equivalent. The automatic thesaurus is generated by computing the co\u2010occurrence values between domain\u2010specific terms found in a document collection.

The accuracy of the verification engine in a biometric system depends heavily on the performance of the adopted Data Acquisition Sensor. In this paper, a face data acquisition technique called the Eye-Masking Method, is proposed to perform face image capturing and preprocessing. In addition, a fast and accurate eye location approach for feature extraction in the Eye-Masking Method is proposed. An experiment that evaluates the performance of the Eye-Masking Method is also given in this paper.", "Despite the increasing popularity of the Internet as a communications medium, the bulk of its traffic is still made up of non-multimedia data. The best effort nature of the current Internet Protocol (IPv4) does not provide any quality of service (QoS) guarantees for high bandwidth applications such as real-time multimedia transmission, which have severe constraints on bandwidth, packet loss and delay. We describe current QoS control mechanisms and propose an integrated QoS control mechanism (IQCM). IQCM is a 5-stage mechanism that performs network congestion control, forward error correction (FEC) and error-resilient coding. To support generic data, our focus is primarily on the transport layer rather than compression semantics. IQCM may be used to support multimedia data delivery over the Internet, such as Web-based video-on-demand systems. Experimental results have validated IQCM's ability to control\u00a0\u2026", "In order to facilitate Internet fax-to-fax communication, an Internet fax adapter (IFA) is designed to provide a seamless interface for traditional fax users to do Internet faxing without changing the mode of faxing operations they are familiar with. The IFA is designed to be inserted between the fax machine and the telephone line socket. It routes fax messages to an Internet fax gateway and captures the destination fax number without user intervention. The user simply needs to operate the fax machine normally by keying in the destination fax number and then feeding in the documents to be faxed. The entire process of routing the fax through the Internet is thus transparent.", "The study outlines a number of security requirements that is typical of a host of Web-based applications using a case study of a real life online Web-based customer support system. It subsequently proposes a security solution that employs a combination of Web server security measures and cryptographic techniques. The Web server security measures include the formulation and implementation of a policy for server physical security, configuration control, users' access control and regular Web server log checks. Login passwords, in conjunction with public key cryptographic techniques and random nounces, are used to achieve user authentication, provide a safeguard against replay attacks, and prevent nonrepudiatory usage of system by users. These techniques, together with the use of session keys, will allow data integrity and confidentiality of the customer support system to be enforced. Furthermore, a number of security guidelines have been observed in the implementation of the relevant software to ensure the further safeness of the system.", "Facsimile (fax) machines have been widely used as a communication tool in business, industry, and even the personal environment. However, as fax messages are transmitted via telephone lines and treated as paper documents for reading and dissemination, new approaches are needed to handle fax messages automatically in an IT environment. In this paper, we discuss a fax image analysis and management system. The objective of the system is to recognize, store, and route fax messages automatically in a distributed environment. Fax message images are interpreted and routed to the appropriate receiver's mailbox. In addition, the contents of each fax message is recognized and stored according to its logical and layout format in order to reduce the amount of storage required. The proposed system is based on a client-server architecture. The fax server consists of six processes: (1) preprocessing, (2) block\u00a0\u2026", "This paper focuses on describing how to apply document image processing technology into fax communications. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the concepts on document image processing. Section 3 describes the fax message analysis process, it focuses on discussing the address block identification and address data analysis. Some experimental results are also given. Section 4 describes the system architecture and user interface of the AutoFax system. Finally, conclusion and future work are given in Section 5.", "An Internet telephony system functions like a conventional telephone to support real-time voice communication over the Internet. A performance evaluation using qualitative assessment techniques have been conducted for four Internet telephony systems, namely, Cool Talk, NetMeeting, Internet Phone, and IHPhone. In addition, five codecs (compression/decompression techniques) extracted from Speak Freely were similarly assessed. These include simple compression, GSM, ADPCM, LPC and LPC-10. A total of four methods comprising Diagnostic Rhyme Test, Diagnostic Acceptability Measure, Degradation Category Rating, and Free Conversation Test have been utilised in the qualitative assessment of these systems and codecs.", "ParaServe is an intelligent parallel mass storage file server. Drawing on the concepts of RAID it utilizes arrays of volume production disk drives connected and controlled by a transputer based network to achieve as a primary objective, high I/O performance. These levels of performance are required by systems which provide database services, especially multimedia and video data, to a large number of users. The scalability of transputer arrays will provide the processing capabilities for the eventual incorporation of database processing facilities like select, join and sort.< >", "The diversity of natural language expressions for describing events poses a challenge for the task of Event Detection (ED) with machine learning methods. To detect and classify event mentions, ED models essentially need to construct a semantic linkage between representations of the mentions and a set of target types. Unfortunately, most existing models use meaningless homogeneous one-hot vectors to represent the event type classes in ED, ignoring the fact that the event type labels also consist of meaningful words and can provide important clues for type representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Semantic Prototype Representation Learning Framework for Event Detection (SemPRE), which exploits the pre-defined event type label words to inject the semantic information of the types and guide event detection. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained BERT to fuse text and event type into a joint\u00a0\u2026", "Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is a challenging topic in Natural Language Processing. Recently, deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance for the AES task. However, applying deep learning models to the AES system in practice is expensive when both data collection and model training are taken into consideration. This paper aims to tackle this problem by proposing the Crowdsourcing-based Automated Essay Scoring (CAES) framework. The proposed framework gradually collects data through crowdsourcing and incrementally trains the AES models. In particular, we propose the Incremental Learning with Dynamic Exemplar Herding (ILDEH) approach to simultaneously tackle catastrophic forgetting and concept drift. The proposed approach dynamically updates the exemplar set by the Dynamic Exemplar Herding algorithm to obtain the best approximation of the overall data distribution and\u00a0\u2026", "In task-oriented dialogue systems, Dialogue State Tracking (DST) aims to extract users' intentions from the dialogue history. Currently, most existing approaches suffer from error propagation and are unable to dynamically select relevant information when utilizing previous dialogue states. Moreover, the relations between the updates of different slots provide vital clues for DST. However, the existing approaches rely only on predefined graphs to indirectly capture the relations. In this paper, we propose a Dialogue State Distillation Network (DSDN) to utilize relevant information of previous dialogue states and migrate the gap of utilization between training and testing. Thus, it can dynamically exploit previous dialogue states and avoid introducing error propagation simultaneously. Further, we propose an inter-slot contrastive learning loss to effectively capture the slot co-update relations from dialogue context. Experiments are conducted on the widely used MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for DST.", "Event Detection, which aims to identify and classify mentions of event instances from unstructured articles, is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Existing techniques for event detection only use homogeneous one-hot vectors to represent the event type classes, ignoring the fact that the semantic meaning of the types is important to the task. Such an approach is inefficient and prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Pivoting Model for Effective Event Detection (SPEED), which explicitly incorporates prior information during training and captures semantically meaningful correlations between input and events. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the baselines in multiple settings without using any external resources.", "We propose R2D2 layers, a new neural block for training efficient NLP models. Our proposed method is characterized by a dynamic weight diffusion mechanism which learns to reuse and reduce parameters in the conventional transformation layer, commonly found in popular Transformer/LSTMs models. Our method is inspired by recent Quaternion methods which share parameters via the Hamilton product. This can be interpreted as a neural and learned approximation of the Hamilton product which imbues our method with increased flexibility and expressiveness, i.e., we are no longer restricted by the 4D nature of Quaternion weight sharing. We conduct extensive experiments in the NLP domain, showing that R2D2 (i) enables a parameter savings of up to 2 times to 16 times with minimal degradation of performance and (ii) outperforms other parameter savings alternative such as low-rank factorization and Quaternion methods.", "Survival analysis is particularly important for modeling the survival probability of patients in clinical research. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the data privacy problem of estimating the survival function and hazard function using parametric models and flexible parametric models. Our proposed Sampling-A-Posterior (SAP) framework publishes a noisy posterior distribution which is guaranteed to be differentially private. This is different from traditional private approaches which publish a point estimate of the model. In the proposed SAP framework, we represent the likelihood function as a linear combination of basis functions and use the K-norm mechanism to publish the coordinate vector of the total likelihood function. The proposed framework can be applied to design differentially private mechanisms for parametric models and flexible parametric models in survival analysis. The experimental results\u00a0\u2026", "Data privacy is a major concern in modern society. In this work, we propose two solutions to the privacy-preserving problem of regression models on medical data. We focus on flexible parametric models which are powerful alternatives to the well-known Cox regression model. For the first approach, we propose a sampling mechanism which guarantees differential privacy for flexible parametric survival models. We first transform the likelihood function of the models to guarantee that likelihood values are bounded. We then use a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampler to sample a random parameter vector from the posterior distribution. As a result, this random vector satisfies the requirement for differential privacy. For the second approach, as predictions with high accuracy and high confidence are very important for medical applications, we propose a mechanism which protects privacy by randomly perturbing the posterior\u00a0\u2026", "Deep learning has become a fundamental component in question answering (QA) research. It is a well established fact that the top QA systems are mostly comprised of neural ranking architectures. Model a er model, we see architectural innovations ranging from word interaction layers to creative new methods for learning a entions. It also seems like these complex interaction mechanisms are mandatory for good performance. Unfortunately, many of these mechanisms incur a prohibitive computation and memory cost making them unfavorable for practical applications. In lieu of that, this paper tackles the question of whether it is possible to achieve competitive performance with very simple neural networks. As such, we propose a simple but novel deep learning architecture for fast and e cient QA. Speci cally, we present H QA, a parameter e cient neural network model that outperforms several parameter heavy models such as A entive Pooling BiLSTMs and Multi Perspective CNN on multiple standard benchmark datasets such as TrecQA, WikiQA and YahooQA. e key innovation to our model is a pairwise ranking objective that performs QA matching in Hyperbolic space instead of Euclidean space. is empowers our model with a self-organizing ability and enables automatic discovery of latent hierarchies while learning embeddings of questions and answers. Our model requires no feature engineering, no similarity matrix matching, no complicated a ention mechanisms nor over-parameterized layers and yet outperforms many models that have these functionalities on multiple benchmarks.", "Many state-of-the-art deep learning models for question answer retrieval are highly complex, o en having a huge number of parameters or complicated word interaction mechanisms. is paper studies if it is possible to achieve equally competitive performance with smaller and faster neural architectures. Overall, our proposed approach is a simple neural network that performs question-answer matching and ranking in Hyperbolic space. We show that QA embeddings learned in Hyperbolic space results in highly competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming models with signi cantly much larger parameters. Our proposed approach (90K parameters) remains competitive to models with millions of parameters such as A entive Pooling BiLSTMs or Multi-Perspective Convolutional Neural Networks (MP-CNN).", "Parallel Test Paper Generation (k-TPG) is a biobjective distributed resource allocation problem, which aims to generate multiple similarly optimal test papers automatically according to multiple userspecified criteria. Generating high-quality parallel test papers is challenging due to its NP-hardness in maximizing the collective objective functions. In this paper, we propose a Collective Biobjective Optimization (CBO) algorithm for solving k-TPG. CBO is a multi-step greedy-based approximation algorithm, which exploits the submodular property for biobjective optimization of k-TPG. Experiment results have shown that CBO has drastically outperformed the current techniques in terms of paper quality and runtime efficiency.", "In this paper, we present a new feature selection method for comparison of each event in big data. The method selects appropriate features for comparing or evaluating each event when we prepare an event set. There are massive data on the Internet as big data. We have been able to retrieve appropriate data sets from them by using given", "There are two main types of approaches for handwritten chemical symbol recognition: image-based approaches and trajectory-based approaches. The current image-based approaches consider mainly the geometrical and statistical information from the captured images of users\u2019 handwritten strokes, while the current trajectory-based recognition approaches only extract temporal symbol features on users\u2019 writing styles. To recognize chemical symbols accurately, however, it is important to identify an effective set of important chemical features by considering the writer dependent features, writer independent features as well as context environment features. In this paper, we propose a novel CF44 chemical feature set based on the trajectory-based recognition approach. The performance of the proposed chemical features is also evaluated with promising results using a chemical formula recognition system.", "We propose a math-aware search engine that is capable of handling both textual keywords as well as mathematical expressions. Our math feature extraction and representation framework captures the semantics of math expressions via a Finite State Machine model. We adapt the passive aggressive online learning binary classi\ufb01er as the ranking model. We benchmarked our approach against three classical information retrieval (IR) strategies on math documents crawled from Math Over ow, a well-known online math question answering system. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can perform better than other methods by more than 9%.", "In recent years, the number of computer-aided educational softwares in mathematics field has been increasing. Currently, there are some research prototypes and systems assisting finding mathematical problems. However, when finding appropriate mathematical expressions, most of these systems only support mechanisms to search expression in a strict exact manner, or search some similar problems based on wildcard, not on the similarity of expression structures and semantic meanings. Such mechanisms restrict users significantly from achieving meaningful and accurate search results of mathematical expressions. In this chapter, we introduce a mathematical retrieval system that helps mathematics learners self-study effectively. The most important module in our system is the math-retrieving system module, which received the analyzed problems submitted from users, retrieves solutions from similar stored\u00a0\u2026", "Segmentation of Chinese text for web content filtering - Enlighten: Publications Skip to main \ncontent Accessibility information Site navigation Study Research About us Student life Alumni \nSupport us Contact Site tools AZ Lists Subjects AZ Staff AZ Academic units AZ University of \nGlasgow logo Home Enlighten Publications Enlighten: Publications About Latest Additions \nSearch Browse Browse by Author Browse by Year Browse by Journal Browse by Research \nFunder Name Browse by Colleges/Schools Open Access ORCID My Publications Login \nSegmentation of Chinese text for web content filtering Hui, SC, Fong, ACM and Hong, GY \n(2011) Segmentation of Chinese text for web content filtering.

To make Internet faxing successful, it is necessary to provide sufficient global coverage. However, this is difficult to achieve as magnitudes of servers and fax modem pools have to be deployed, together with technical personnel for support and maintenance. These will increase costs that will eventually have to be passed on to the user. This paper proposes a distributed fax transportation mechanism that utilizes existing Internet faxing services as secondary resources to provide coverage for fax communication.

In this paper, an Internet real-time faxing system that supports real-time transmission of fax messages is described. The system is known as RTFaxing which consists of two gateways: Fax-In Gateway (FIG) and Fax-Out Gateway (FOG). FIG is responsible for the reception, processing, compression and transmission of fax-image data to FOG through the Internet. FOG then decompresses and reconstructs the fax-images for dispatching to the destination fax machines.

In this instance, the Web browser will act as the user agent of the mailing system. With this, users will be able to compose, send and read video mail directly on the Web. This paper examines a number of possible system architectures that can be employed for the development of Video Mail. Based on the following key issues: portability of system, flexibility of system, Internet standard support, security and authentication, and message compression and storage, a final architecture was selected to build Video Mail. The approach taken is that the system will be interfaced to the Web using a standard HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server and a standard Web browser. This is achieved through the use of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs and forms which reside in a standard HTTP server to provide the functionality of video mail, and a separate mail server for the storage and management of messages. This will cause the HTTP server to behave as if it is an electronic mail system.Video Mail has been successfully implemented at the School of Applied Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The development work has been carried out on a Sun SPARC5 workstation and the Typhoon relational database system was used to construct the mail server. All software codes were written in C or C++. A video capturing application used in conjunction with a SunVideo card has been developed for video and audio recording. The paper also addresses implementation issues pertaining to the\u00a0\u2026", "Multimedia electronic mail (email) systems have become viable enhancements and replacements for traditional and widely accepted ASCII-text only mail systems.", "The Internet\u2019s use as a faxing medium allows users across continents to communicate without incurring the high costs of long-distance phone rates. Geographically dispersed servers connected to local Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN) circumvent the use of international lines by using the Internet instead. This paper proposes an integrated Internet faxing environment, known as FaxPortal, to support different modes of Internet faxing including the use of email, the World Wide Web, and conventional fax devices. FaxPortal's architecture comprises two servers, namely, the Faxing and Fax Receiving Servers. The Faxing Server accepts and converts fax messages into fax-image files for transmission over the Internet. The Fax Receiving Server receives these files and sends them to fax devices over the PSTN. Additionally, FaxPortal has adopted a scheme with three different transportation classes to simplify the support for global fax coverage.", "The Internet\u2019s phenomenal growth, worldwide coverage and increasing data delivery capabilities have made possible its use as an alternative communications medium for real-time voice messages. In addition, using the Internet medium for voice communication circumvents the high costs of long-distance phone rates. This paper discusses the functional architectural design of an Internet Telephony Gateway (ITG) to support real-time Internet voice communication using conventional telephone system (PSTN). The design uses voice modem and sound card to provide the basic interface with the PSTN. This interface is complemented with software functions that control the modem\u2019s operations. In addition, the ITG handles voice communication over the Internet according to an internationally recognised standard, ITU H. 323 Recommendation.", "The high transmission delay and packet loss conditions of the Internet environment have caused jerky video playout and poor quality for real-time video communication. This research proposes a video play-out agent that employs the techniques of dynamic video frames reconstruction and virtual video play-out to enhance the playout performance of Internet video-conferencing. The video play-out agent consists of three main components, namely, buffering mechanism, dynamic video frames reconstruction mechanism and play-out controller. The buffering mechanism stores incoming video frames in buffers. The dynamic video frames reconstruction mechanism is used for reconstructing intermediate frames based on two successive received frames to reduce the jerky effects. The play-out controller uses virtual video play-out mechanism to play back previously received video frames to give users the perception of uninterrupted video transmission.", "An Internet telephony system functions like a conventional telephone to support real-time voice communication over the Internet. The performance of such a system depends upon a number of factors which include network performance, computing resource, voice processor, signal acquisition, output transducer, and method used to establish a connection between users. A performance evaluation using quantitative assessment techniques have been conducted for four Internet telephony systems, namely, CoolTalk, Net Meeting, Internet Phone, and Speak Freely. These were used to assess the factors of network performance, voice processor and connection method.", "Presents the table of contents for this issue of this magazine.", "An Internet Telephony Gateway Server is a server that integrates the Internet into the Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN). It makes use of the Internet as a new form of media to transmit speech audio between two conventional telephones. This paper examines the software design of the server and identifies the necessary Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for the server software. Two main groups of APIs are required. The first group of APIs interfaces with the hardware interface to answer calls, decode DTMF tones, check trunk line availability, make and terminate calls. The second group of APIs interfaces with the Internet to provide functionality for establishing connection, packet loss replacement, packet ordering, packet time stamping, compression and decompression.", "In text categorization, the class agnostic (unsupervised) tf\u00d7 idf term weighting scheme has seen widespread usage. Recently proposed supervised term weighting methods including tf\u00d7 rf and tf\u00d7 \u03b4idf make use of term class distribution to improve the classification accuracy. However, they only account for the presence of terms in classes, ignoring the absence of key categorical terms, which may give a very strong hint of the underlying document class. By taking into account both the presence and absence of terms, we propose a novel probabilistic family of supervised term weighting methods that are highly optimized for classification tasks. Experiments show that our robust term weighting schemes can significantly improve the performance of Support Vector Machines in various binary text categorization tasks."]}}
