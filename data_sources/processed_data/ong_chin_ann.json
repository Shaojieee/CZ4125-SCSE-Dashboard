He obtained his Bachelor's and Master\u2019s Degree both from the Swinburne University of Technology, Australia in 2009 and 2012, respectively. He was a System Developer at IDS (Asia), Malaysia. He then advances his career as an academician and teaches CompSci courses at various local and foreign universities/schools.His main research interest focuses on computer vision and image processing. Currently, Chin Ann is focusing on Computer Vision research (CNN), specifically on Cross-Domain Adaptation for plant species identification task by fusing herbarium sheets and plant leaves into the same space. He also explores Few Shot Learning strategies to solve long-tail distribution problems which commonly occur for the plant species identification task. In addition to referred international conference and journal paper publications, Chin Ann also served as program/technical committee for international conferences, and reviewer of journals. He was the organizing committee for the 19th SDPS Conference 2014 & the 8th IEEE R10 HTC 2020. Chin Ann is Senior Member of IEEE and Professional Member from the Singapore Computer Society (SCS).
