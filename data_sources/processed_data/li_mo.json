We discuss the design of a Structure-Aware Self-Adaptive WSN system, SASA. By regulating the mesh sensor network deployment and formulating a collaborative mechanism based on a regular beacon strategy, SASA is able to rapidly detect structure variations caused by underground collapses. We further develop a sound and robust mechanism for efficiently handling queries under instable circumstances. A prototype is deployed with 27 mica2 motes in a real coal mine. We present our implementation experiences as well as the experimental results. To better evaluate the scalability and reliability of SASA, we also conduct a large-scale trace-driven simulation based on real data collected from the experiments.", "In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Legacy systems that can provide such accuracy are either expensive or suffering from performance degradation resulting from various impacts, e.g., occlusion for computer vision based approaches. In this work, we present an RFID-based system, Tagoram, for object localization and tracking using COTS RFID tags and readers. Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. Our system achieves these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. In Tagoram, we exploit the tag's mobility to build a virtual antenna array by using readings from a few physical antennas over a time window.

Recent studies show that the power delay profile may be derived from the CSI traces collected from commodity WiFi devices, but the performance is limited by two dominating factors. The resolution of the derived power delay profile is determined by the channel bandwidth, which is however limited on commodity WiFi. The collected CSI reflects the signal distortions due to both the channel attenuation and the hardware imperfection. A direct derivation of power delay profiles using raw CSI measures, as has been done in the literature, results in significant inaccuracy. In this paper, we present Splicer, a software-based system that derives high-resolution power delay profiles by splicing the CSI measurements from multiple WiFi frequency bands. We propose a set of key techniques to separate the\u00a0\u2026", "The bus arrival time is primary information to most city transport travelers. Excessively long waiting time at bus stops often discourages the travelers and makes them reluctant to take buses. In this paper, we present a bus arrival time prediction system based on bus passengers' participatory sensing. With commodity mobile phones, the bus passengers' surrounding environmental context is effectively collected and utilized to estimate the bus traveling routes and predict bus arrival time at various bus stops. The proposed system solely relies on the collaborative effort of the participating users and is independent from the bus operating companies, so it can be easily adopted to support universal bus service systems without requesting support from particular bus operating companies. Instead of referring to GPS enabled location information, we resolve to more generally available and energy efficient sensing resources\u00a0\u2026", "Sensor networks are deemed suitable for large-scale deployments in the wild for a variety of applications. In spite of the remarkable efforts the community put to build the sensor systems, an essential question still remains unclear at the system level, motivating us to explore the answer from a point of real-world deployment view. Does the wireless sensor network really scale? We present findings from a large-scale operating sensor network system, GreenOrbs, with up to 330 nodes deployed in the forest. We instrument such an operating network throughout the protocol stack and present observations across layers in the network. Based on our findings from the system measurement, we propose and make initial efforts to validate three conjectures that give potential guidelines for future designs of large-scale sensor networks. 1) A small portion of nodes bottlenecks the entire network, and most of the existing network\u00a0\u2026", "Sensor positioning is a crucial part of many location-dependent applications that utilize wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Current localization approaches can be divided into two groups: range-based and range-free. Due to the high costs and critical as-sumptions, the range-based schemes are often impractical for WSNs. The existing range-free schemes, on the other hand, suffer from poor accuracy and low scalability. Without the help of a large number of uniformly deployed seed nodes, those schemes fail in anisotropic WSNs with possible holes. To address this issue, we propose the Rendered Path (REP) protocol. To the best of our knowledge, REP is the only range-free protocol for locating sen-sors with constant number of seeds in anisotropic sensor net-works.", "The wireless sensor network (WSN) technology spawns a surge of unforeseen applications. The diversity of these emerging applications represents the great success of this technology. A fundamental performance benchmark of such applications is topology control, which characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored and how well each pair of sensors is mutually connected in WSNs. This paper provides an overview of topology control techniques. We classify existing topology control techniques into two categories: network coverage and network connectivity. For each category, a surge of existing protocols and techniques are presented with the focus on blanket coverage, barrier coverage, sweep coverage, power management, and power control, five rising aspects that attract significant research attention in recent years. In this survey, we emphasize the basic principles of topology control to understand the\u00a0\u2026", "Network diagnosis, an essential research topic for traditional networking systems, has not received much attention for wireless sensor networks. Existing sensor debugging tools like sympathy or EmStar rely heavily on an add-in protocol that generates and reports a large amount of status information from individual sen-sor nodes, introducing network overhead to a resource constrained and usually traffic sensitive sensor network. We report in this study our initial attempt at providing a light-weight network diag-nosis mechanism for sensor networks. We propose PAD, a prob-abilistic diagnosis approach for inferring the root causes of ab-normal phenomena. PAD employs a packet marking algorithm for efficiently constructing and dynamically maintaining the inference model. Our approach does not incur additional traffic overhead for collecting desired information. Instead, we introduce a prob-abilistic inference model\u00a0\u2026", "The location and context switching, especially the indoor/outdoor switching, provides essential and primitive information for upper-layer mobile applications. In this article, we present IODetector: a lightweight sensing service that runs on the mobile phone and detects the indoor/outdoor environment in a fast, accurate, and efficient manner. Constrained by the energy budget, IODetector primarily leverages lightweight sensing resources, such as light sensors, magnetism sensors, and cell tower signals. For universal applicability, IODetector assumes no prior knowledge (e.g., fingerprints) of the environment and uses only on-board sensors common to mainstream mobile phones. Being a generic and lightweight service component, IODetector greatly benefits many location-based and context-aware applications. We prototype the IODetector on Android mobile phones and evaluate the system comprehensively with data\u00a0\u2026", "Long Range (LoRa) is a Low-power Wide-area Network technology designed for the Internet of Things. In recent years, it has gained significant momentum among industrial and research communities. Patented by Semtech, LoRa makes use of chirp spread spectrum modulation to deliver data with promises of long battery life, far-reaching communication distances, and a high node density at the cost of data rate. In this article, we conduct a series of experiments to verify the claims made by Semtech on LoRa technology. Our results show that LoRa is capable of communicating over 10km under line-of-sight environments. However, under non-line-of-sight environments, LoRa\u2019s performance is severely affected by obstructions such as buildings and vegetations. Moreover, the promise of prolonged battery life requires extreme tuning of parameters. Last, a LoRa gateway supports up to 6,000 nodes with PRR\u00a0\u2026", "Wi-Fi localization and tracking face accuracy limitations dictated by antenna count (for angle-of-arrival methods) and frequency bandwidth (for time-of-arrival methods). This paper presents mD-Track, a device-free Wi-Fi tracking system capable of jointly fusing information from as many dimensions as possible to overcome the resolution limit of each individual dimension. Through a novel path separation algorithm, mD-Track can resolve multipath at a much finer-grained resolution, isolating signals reflected off targets of interest. mD-Track can localize human passively at a high accuracy with just a single Wi-Fi transceiver pair. mD-Track also introduces novel methods to greatly streamline its estimation algorithms, achieving real-time operation. We implement mD-Track on both WARP and cheap off-the-shelf commodity Wi-Fi hardware, and evaluate its performance in different indoor environments.", "We present Travi-Navi - a vision-guided navigation system that enables a self-motivated user to easily bootstrap and deploy indoor navigation services, without comprehensive indoor localization systems or even the availability of floor maps. Travi-Navi records high quality images during the course of a guider's walk on the navigation paths, collects a rich set of sensor readings, and packs them into a navigation trace. The followers track the navigation trace, get prompt visual instructions and image tips, and receive alerts when they deviate from the correct paths. Travi-Navi also finds the most efficient shortcuts whenever possible. We encounter and solve several challenges, including robust tracking, shortcut identification, and high quality image capture while walking. We implement Travi-Navi and conduct extensive experiments. The evaluation results show that Travi-Navi can track and navigate users with timely\u00a0\u2026", "The phone attitude is an essential input to many smartphone applications, which has been known very difficult to accurately estimate especially over long time. Based on in-depth understanding of the nature of the MEMS gyroscope and other IMU sensors commonly equipped on smartphones, we propose A3 - an accurate and automatic attitude detector for commodity smartphones. A3 primarily leverages the gyroscope, but intelligently incorporates the accelerometer and magnetometer to select the best sensing capabilities and derive the most accurate attitude estimation. Extensive experimental evaluation on various types of Android smartphones confirms the outstanding performance of A3. Compared with other existing solutions, A3 provides 3x improvement on the accuracy of attitude estimation.", "Many efforts have been made for addressing coverage problems in sensor networks. They fall into two categories, full coverage and barrier coverage, featured as static coverage. In this work, we study a new coverage scenario, sweep coverage, which differs with the previous static coverage. In sweep coverage, we only need to monitor certain points of interest (POIs) periodically so the coverage at each POI is time-variant, and thus we are able to utilize a small number of mobile sensors to achieve sweep coverage among a much larger number of POIs. We investigate the definitions and model for sweep coverage. Given a set of POIs and their sweep period requirements, we prove that determining the minimum number of required sensors (min-sensor sweep-coverage problem) is NP-hard, and it cannot be approximated within a factor of 2. We propose a centralized algorithm with constant approximation ratio 3 for\u00a0\u2026", "Event detection is a crucial task for wireless sensor network applications, especially environment monitoring. Existing approaches for event detection are mainly based on some predefined threshold values, and thus are often inaccurate and incapable of capturing complex events. For example, in coal mine monitoring scenarios, gas leakage or water osmosis can hardly be described by the overrun of specified attribute thresholds, but some complex pattern in the full-scale view of the environmental data. To address this issue, we propose a non-threshold based approach for the real 3D sensor monitoring environment. We employ energy-efficient methods to collect a time series of data maps from the sensor network and detect complex events through matching the gathered data to spatio-temporal data patterns. Finally, we conduct trace driven simulations to prove the efficacy and efficiency of this approach on\u00a0\u2026", "Contour mapping is a crucial part of many wireless sensor network applications. Many efforts have been made to avoid collecting data from all the sensors in the network and producing maps at the sink, which is proven to be inefficient. The existing approaches (often aggregation based), however, suffer from heavy transmission traffic and incur large computational overheads on each sensor node. We propose Iso-Map, an energy-efficient protocol for contour mapping, which builds contour maps based solely on the reports collected from intelligently selected \u201cisoline nodes\u201d in wireless sensor networks. Iso-Map achieves high-quality contour mapping while significantly reducing the generated traffic from O(n) to O(\\sqrt n), where n is the total number of sensor nodes in the field. The pernode computation overhead is also restrained as a constant. We conduct comprehensive trace-driven simulations to verify this protocol\u00a0\u2026", "Fast searching a particular subset in a large number of products attached with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags is of practical importance for a variety of applications, but not yet thoroughly investigated. Since the cardinality of the products can be extremely large, collecting the tag information directly from each of those tags could be highly inefficient. To address the tag searching efficiency in large-scale RFID systems, this paper proposes several algorithms to meet the stringent delay requirement in developing fast tag searching protocols. We formally formulate the tag searching problem in large-scale RFID systems. We propose utilizing compact approximators to efficiently aggregate a large volume of RFID tag information and exchange such information with a two-phase approximation protocol. By estimating the intersection of two compact approximators, the proposed two-phase compact approximator\u00a0\u2026", "Sea depth monitoring is a critical task to ensure the safe operation of harbors. Traditional schemes largely rely on labor-intensive work and expensive hardware. This study explores the possibility of deploying networked sensors on the surface of sea, measuring and reporting sea depth of given areas. We propose a restricted floating sensors (RFS) model, in which sensor nodes are anchored to the sea bottom, floating within a restricted area. Distinguished from traditional stationary or mobile sensor networks, the RFS network consists of sensor nodes with restricted mobility. We construct the network model and elaborate the corresponding localization problem. We show that by locating such RFS sensors, the sea depth can be estimated without the help of any extra ranging devices. A prototype system with 25 Telos sensor nodes is deployed to validate this design. We also examine the efficiency and scalability of this\u00a0\u2026", "Traffic information is of great importance for urban cities, and accurate prediction of urban traffics has been pursued for many years. Urban traffic prediction aims to exploit sophisticated models to capture hidden traffic characteristics from substantial historical mobility data and then makes use of trained models to predict traffic conditions in the future. Due to the powerful capabilities of representation learning and feature extraction, emerging deep learning becomes a potent alternative for such traffic modeling. In this article, we envision the potential and broard usage of deep learning in predictions of various traffic indicators, for example, traffic speed, traffic flow, and accident risk. In addition, we summarize and analyze some early attempts that have achieved notable performance. By discussing these existing advances, we propose two future research directions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of urban traffic\u00a0\u2026", "Current commodity RFID systems incur high communication overhead due to severe tag-to-tag collisions. Although some recent works have been proposed to support parallel decoding for concurrent tag transmissions, they require accurate channel measurements, tight tag synchronization, or modifications to standard RFID tag operations. In this paper, we present BiGroup, a novel RFID communication paradigm that allows the reader to decode the collision from multiple COTS (commodity-off-the-shelf) RFID tags in one communication round. In BiGroup, COTS tags can directly join ongoing communication sessions and get decoded in parallel. The collision resolution intelligence is solely put at the reader side. To this end, BiGroup examines the tag collisions at RFID physical layer from constellation domain as well as time domain, exploits the under-utilized channel capacity due to low tag transmission rate, and\u00a0\u2026", "Estimating the number of RFID tags in the region of interest is an important task in many RFID applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for efficiently estimating the approximate number of RFID tags. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed Probabilistic Estimating Tree (PET) protocol achieves {\\cal O}(\\log \\log n) estimation efficiency, which remarkably reduces the estimation time while meeting the accuracy requirement. PET also largely reduces the computation and memory overhead at RFID tags. As a result, we are able to apply PET with passive RFID tags and provide scalable and inexpensive solutions for large-scale RFID systems. We validate the efficacy and effectiveness of PET through theoretical analysis as well as extensive simulations. Our results suggest that PET outperforms existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and overhead.", "We study the ubiquitous data collection for mobile users in wireless sensor networks. People with handheld devices can easily interact with the network and collect data. We propose a novel approach for mobile users to collect the network-wide data. The routing structure of data collection is additively updated with the movement of the mobile user. With this approach, we only perform a local modification to update the routing structure while the routing performance is bounded and controlled compared to the optimal performance. The proposed protocol is easy to implement.

They fall into two categories, full coverage and barrier coverage, featured as static coverage. In this work, we study a new coverage scenario, sweep coverage, which differs with the previous static coverage. In sweep coverage, we only need to monitor certain points of interest (POIs) periodically so the coverage at each POI is time-variant, and thus we are able to utilize a small number of mobile sensors to achieve sweep coverage among a much larger number of POIs. We investigate the definitions and model for sweep coverage. Given a set of POIs and their sweep period requirements, we prove that determining the minimum number of required sensors (min-sensor sweep-coverage problem) is NP-hard, and it cannot be approximated within a factor of 2.

Pando encodes data by Fountain codes and disseminates the rateless stream of encoded packets along the fast and parallel pipelines built on constructive interference and channel diversity. Since every encoded packet contains innovative information to the original data object, Pando avoids duplicate retransmissions and fully exploits the wireless broadcast effect in data dissemination. To transform Pando into a practical system, we devise several techniques, including the integration of Fountain coding with the timing-critical operations of constructive interference and pipelining, a silence based feedback scheme for the one-way pipelined dissemination, and packet-level adaptation of network density and channel diversity. Based on these techniques, Pando can accomplish the data dissemination\u00a0\u2026", "A fundamental goal of data center networking is to efficiently interconnect a large number of servers with the low equipment cost.

There is an urgent need to develop an efficient sleep interval control strategy for achieving fair and high energy efficiency. To this end, we theoretically formulate the Sleep Interval Control (SIC) problem and find out that it is a convex optimization problem.

By encoding sparse path representation into packets, the path vector (and thus the represented path) can be recovered from a small amount of packets using compressive sensing technique. CSPR formalizes the sparse path representation and enables accurate and efficient per-packet path reconstruction. CSPR is invulnerable to network dynamics and lossy links due to its distinct design.

Our proposed application differs from previous work in that they typically treat the sensor network as a media of data acquisition while in our navigation application, in-situ interactions between users and sensors become ubiquitous. In addition, human safety and time factors are critical to the success of our objective. Without any preknowledge of user and sensor locations, the design of an effective and efficient navigation protocol faces nontrivial challenges. We propose to embed a road map system in the sensor network without location information so as to provide users navigating routes with guaranteed safety. We accordingly design efficient road map updating mechanisms to rebuild the road map in the event of changes in dangerous areas.

The design combats three primary challenges: 1) relatively low accuracy of mobile gaze tracking; 2) difficulties in correcting input errors due to lacking the comparison with the true text-entry value; and 3) device motions and other noises that may interfere gaze tracking accuracy and thus the iType performance. We devise a set of effective techniques, including leveraging a collective behavior of the gaze tracking results, unique correlation of the typing error spatial distributions, and motion sensor hints from mobile devices, to address above challenges.

Pando encodes data by Fountain codes and disseminates the rateless stream of encoded packets along the fast and parallel pipelines built on constructive interference and channel diversity. Since every encoded packet contains innovative information to the original data object, Pando avoids duplicate retransmissions and fully exploits the wireless broadcast effect in data dissemination. To transform Pando into a practical system, we devise several techniques, including the integration of Fountain coding with the timing-critical operations of constructive interference and pipelining, a silence-based feedback scheme for the one-way pipelined dissemination, and packet-level adaptation of network density and channel diversity. Based on these techniques, Pando can accomplish data dissemination\u00a0\u2026", "Sea depth monitoring is a critical task for ensuring safe operation of harbors. Traditional schemes largely rely on labor-intensive work and expensive hardware.

Distinguished from traditional stationary or mobile sensor networks, the RFS network consists of sensor nodes with restricted mobility. We construct the network model and elaborate the corresponding localization problem.

Based on such a participatory sensing framework, the system turns buses into dummy probes, monitors their travel statuses, and derives the instant traffic map of the city. Unlike previous works that rely on intrusive detection or full cooperation from \"probe vehicles\", our approach resorts to the crowd-participation of ordinary bus riders, who are the information source providers and major consumers of the final traffic output.

VitalAlley aims to identify the uncharted walkways from the big but noisy personal mobility data and incorporate these findings into existing incomplete road maps. The implementation of VitalAlley faces the major challenges due to the unstructured nature of the walkways themselves and the noise from crowdsensing data.

Real time urban traffic information is critical to wide populations living in the city but undergoes significant spatial and temporal variation especially in the urban areas and calls for well monitoring. For the past decades, increasing efforts have been put into exploring an accurate, efficient, and inexpensive way to instantly monitor the urban traffic conditions. Conventional methods rely on intrusive sensing, where people deploy infrastructural devices like loop detectors or traffic cameras at roadsides to actively detect traffic references. Installing such intrusive devices incurs substantial deployment and maintenance costs and can only provide limited observation at sparse positions.

By doing so, the mobile sink is able to efficiently collect network-wide data within a given delay bound and the network can eliminate the energy bottleneck to dramatically prolong its lifetime. Such a joint optimization problem is shown to be NP-hard and we propose an approximation algorithm, named RPS-LB, to approach the optimal solution. In RPS-LB, according to observed properties of the median reference structure in the network, a series of Rendezvous Points (RPs) are selected to construct the trajectory for the mobile sink and the derived approximation ratio of RPSLB guarantees that the formed trajectory is comparable with the optimal solution.

VeTrac fuses mobility correlation and vision-based analysis to reduce uncertainties in identifying vehicles. A graph convolution process is employed to maintain the identity consistency across different camera observations, and a self-training process is invoked when aligning with the urban road network to reconstruct vehicle trajectories with confidence.

The vehicle trajectory transition patterns are studied to explicitly model the spatial traffic demand via graph propagation along the road network; an attention mechanism is designed to learn the temporal dependencies based on neighborhood traffic status; and finally, a fusion of multi-step prediction is integrated into the graph neural network design. The proposed approach is evaluated with a real-world trajectory dataset. Experiment results show that the proposed TrGNN model achieves over 5% error reduction when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches across all metrics for normal traffic, and up to 14% for atypical traffic during peak hours or abnormal events. The advantage of trajectory transitions especially manifest itself in inferring high fluctuation of flows as well as non-recurrent flow patterns.", "Recently, wearable devices have become increasingly popular in our lives because of their neat features and stylish appearance. However, their tiny sizes bring about new challenges to human-device interaction such as texts input.

As a result, we propose an acoustic-based texts-entry system, i.e., EchoWrite, by which texts can be entered with a finger writing in the air without wearing any additional device. More importantly, different from many previous works, EchoWrite runs in a training-free style which reduces the training overhead and improves system scalability.

We mathematically analyze the root cause of such clock uncertainty and propose a protocol called EATS. Sensor nodes with EATS can intelligently select the best synchronization parents that minimize the negative impact of the energy heterogeneity.

In many applications with wireless sensor networks, it is essential to understand how well an interested area is monitored (covered) by sensors. The traditional way of evaluating sensor coverage requires that every point in the field should be monitored and the sensor network should be connected to transmit messages to a processing center (sink). Such a requirement is too strong to be financially practical in many scenarios. In this study, we address another type of coverage problem, sweep coverage, where we utilize mobile nodes to help data retrieval in a sensor network. Different from previous coverage problems, we focus on retrieving data from dynamic Points of Interest (POIs), where a sensor network does not necessarily have fixed data rendezvous points as POIs. Instead, any sensor node within the network may become a POI. We first analyze the relationship among information access delay, information access probability, and the number of required mobile nodes. We then design a distributed algorithm based on a virtual 3D map of local gradient information to guide the movement of mobile nodes to achieve sweep coverage of dynamic POIs. Using the analytical results as the guideline for setting the system parameters, we examine the performance of our algorithm compared to existing approaches.", "802.11 WLANs suffer from high packet losses due to interference and noise.

The major design challenge lies in deriving an accurate relationship between the frequency selective channel condition and the decoded packet bit BERs, all the way through the complex 802.11 PHY layer. Based on our study, we find that the decoding error of a packet bit corresponds to dense errors in the underlying codeword bits, and the BER can be truthfully approximated by the codeword bit error density. With above observation, we propose UnPKT, scheme that protects packet bits using different MAC-layer FEC redundancies based on bit-wise BER estimation to augment wide-band 802\u00a0\u2026", null, "The high mobility of VANET makes information exchange across the network excessively difficult.

The downlink transmission often suffers from its short range and vulnerability to interference, which limits the practical application and deployment of backscatter communication systems. In this paper, we propose passive DSSS to improve the downlink communication for practical backscatter systems. Passive DSSS is able to increase the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by using direct sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) techniques to suppress interference and noise. The key challenge lies in the demodulation of DSSS signals, where the conventional solutions require power-hungry computations to synchronize a locally generated spreading code with the received DSSS signal, which is infeasible on energy-constrained backscatter devices. Passive DSSS addresses such a challenge by shifting the generation and synchronization of the spreading code from the receiver to the gateway side, and therefore achieves ultra-low power DSSS demodulation. We prototype passive DSSS for proof of concept. The experimental results show that passive DSSS improves the downlink SINR by 16.5 dB, which translates to a longer effective downlink range for backscatter communication systems.", "Low-power wide-area network technologies such as long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) are promising for collecting low-rate monitoring data from geographically distributed sensors, in which timestamping the sensor data is a critical system function.

However, we show that this approach is susceptible to a frame delay attack consisting of malicious frame collision and delayed replay. Real experiments show that the attack can affect the end devices in large areas up to about 50, 000 m 2 . In a broader sense, the attack threatens any system functions requiring timely deliveries of LoRaWAN frames.

By attaching a tag to each product, a reader can employ an authentication protocol to interrogate the tag's information for verification, which facilitates the automatic processing and monitoring of products in many applications. However, most current solutions can not be directly used as they can not balance the tradeoff between the privacy and efficiency for individual parties. In this paper, we design a bidirectional efficiency-privacy transferable (BEST) authentication protocol to address this issue. In a relatively secure domain, BEST works in an efficient manner to authenticate batches of tags with less privacy guarantee. Once the tags flow into open environment, BEST can migrate to provide stronger privacy protection to the tags with moderate efficiency degradation.

It can be launched without compromising any legitimate node or cryptographic mechanisms, and often serves as a stepping stone for many serious attacks. Most existing countermeasures often make critical assumptions or require specialized hardware devices in the network. Those assumptions and requirements limit the applicability of previous approaches. In this work, we explore the impact of wormhole attacks on network connectivity topologies, and develop a simple distributed method to detect wormholes, called WormCircle. WormCircle relies solely on local connectivity information without any requirements on special hardware devices or making any rigorous assumptions on network properties. We establish the correctness of this design in continuous geometric domains and extend it into discrete networks. We evaluate the effectiveness in randomly deployed sensor networks through extensive simulations.", "Geographical hash table (GHT) has been widely used to provide energy efficiency for data-centric storage in wireless sensor networks. Such a mechanism, however, suffers from high communication cost when we apply multi-dimensional event search in the network. In this work, we present MDS, a flexible, complete, and efficient multi-dimensional search mechanism atop traditional GHT based data-centric storage architecture. MDS utilizes bloom filters to reduce the communication cost of in-network intersection and union operations for multi-dimensional queries in wireless sensor networks. This scheme can be easily extended to support multi-dimensional range queries. Our mathematical analysis indicates the optimal settings for the bloom filters that maximize the traffic savings according to the information popularities.

Because sensor nodes are generally battery powered, to prolong network lifetime, energy conservation becomes a major concern in answering queries over sensor networks. In addition, a robust and fault-tolerant data-collection method is highly desirable against a lossy network with low-quality wireless communication links and unreliable sensor nodes. We propose a signature-file-based approach to approximately answer queries over WSNs. By combining the duplicate-insensitive structure of signature files and the redundant multipath routing approach, we create a robust in-network aggregation scheme, which can answer both aggregative and range queries with high accuracy while significantly reducing the cost of message transmissions.

DopEnc automatically identifies the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones, and accelerometers integrated on mainstream smartphones.

Unfortunately many users are plagued with Phantom Data Usage (PDU), which refers to the unexpected mobile data usage that does not accord with user perception. We investigate about 400 real PDU issues and find the causes of PDU are not only the exceptions of applications, for example, software bugs or malware, but also the user's personalized misuse. Based on the observations that each user preserves specific data usage patterns under particular environmental context, we present PDS, a PDU detection system, which automatically detects whether the current data usage is consumed as expected. Results from our evaluation experiments show that 72% of PDU cases detected by PDS are confirmed by users.", "Based on plenty of sensors on smartphones and tablets, their location information becomes more accurate and easy to access. Many position-based applications have thus been developed. As these mobile devices have become the main access approach of 802.11-based wireless local area networks (WLAN), location information also provides opportunities to improve the performance of underlying wireless communication. This paper presents CO-MAP (Co-Occurrence MAP), which leverages location information to handle exposed and hidden terminal problems, which are still a major cause of throughput degradation in mobile WLANs.

The users are equipped with communicating devices like 802.15. 4 compatible PDAs that talk with sensors. Under emergencies, the sensor network explores the dangerous areas and provides necessary guiding information to safely navigate the users out of the field. Many efforts have been made towards guiding navigation using wireless sensor networks. As a natural intuition, most existing approaches assume the availability of locations on each sensor node. Based on the awareness of the locations of dangerous areas, the sensor network incurs easy and efficient route calculations to navigate internal users out of the emergent field. The location information may not be always available in many practical situations, such as underground tunnel or coal mine environment, complicated indoor area, etc. As reported in our recent work for the coal mine surveillance sensor network [1], it is essential to navigate miners to retreat from the coal mine tunnels after emergency happens, yet obtaining accurate location for each sensor is quite difficult in the GPS-less underground environment. Indeed, the requirement of location information largely limits the applicability of existing approaches on location-free environment. Besides, existing approaches do not specifically consider the impact of the variations on dangerous areas, eg, the emerging, expanding, shrinking or diminishing of dangerous areas. In reality, such variations might significantly degrade the effectiveness or even overwhelm existing navigation protocols\u00a0\u2026", "In wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), energy is a crucial resource. Topology control technology allows network nodes to reduce their transmission power while preserving the network connectivity. A MANET is a non-cooperative system so that only when a node earns its payment, which can cover its cost, the cooperation can be stimulated. We design a truthful topology control mechanism (TRUECON) for MANETs to induce the selfish, but rational, network nodes to collaborate. Truth-telling is a dominant strategy in TRUECON. A node needs to reveal its true value in order to obtain the maximum expected utility. We prove the overpayment of TRUECON has a bound depending on different radio propagation models", "In many sensor network applications, multiple data forwarding tasks usually exist with different source-destination node pairs. Due to limitations of the duty-cycling operation and interference, however, not all tasks can be guaranteed to be scheduled within their required delay constraints. We investigate a fundamental scheduling problem of both theoretical and practical importance, called multi-task schedulability problem, i.e., given multiple data forwarding tasks, to determine the maximum number of tasks that can be scheduled within their deadlines and work out such a schedule. We formulate the multi-task schedulability problem, prove its NP-Hardness, and propose an approximate algorithm with analysis on the performance bound and complicity. We further extend the proposed algorithm by explicitly altering duty cycles of certain sensor nodes so as to fully support applications with stringent delay requirements\u00a0\u2026", "In a pioneering work, Gupta and Kumar [9] studied the critical transmission range needed for the connectivity of random wireless networks.

Current approaches assume mobile sensors with the capability of arbitrary movement. The usage of such sensors with unlimited mobility, however, requires complicated sensor manufactures and high intelligence of movement which are practically unrealistic in many practical applications. We investigate the usage of cable-based mobile sensors which move along pre-deployed cables to accomplish sensing tasks at different positions. A target area is said to be reachable, if for any point in this area, at least one mobile sensor can move along the cable and achieve coverage to the point within a specified delay bound.

To this end, we first transform user QoS requirements to multi-resource demands and apply the dominant resource fairness scheme to allocate network resources for each user. We prove several salient QoS-based fairness properties based on a model mapping between QoS and resources. We further discuss about more general conditions for diverse mapping models where QoS fairness properties can be satisfied. We find that the QoS fairness properties can be guaranteed as long as the mapping\u00a0\u2026", "Background. Lifelogging stands for an activity to digitalize human daily lives, which was widely adopted in the therapy for a series of neurodegenerative diseases using dedicated devices [5]. Nowadays, due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices, the usage of lifelogging has been dramatically expended. For instance, it already becomes an emerging culture for people to collect their daily memorial moments and share them on social network. Although people can use various on-board sensors from mobile devices to log their lives in many different ways, e.g., the text, image, audio clip, video, etc., it requires excessive user's interventions. Many brief but valuable moments could be easily missed due to the lag when a user performs lifelogging. On the other hand, the intervention overhead causes non-negligible burdens and may impair user willingness to conduct lifelogging.

However, the number of accumulated packets should be carefully determined. Otherwise, the system performance may not be improved or even be degraded, e.g., incurring additional packet delay. Based on the analysis result, we present STAGGER to achieve channel utilization improvement while guarantee the worst case performance.

PriMask significantly weakens the cloud's capability to recover the data or extract certain private attributes. The MaskNet is cascadable in that the mobile can opt in to or out of its use seamlessly without any modifications to the cloud's inference service. Moreover, the mobiles use different MaskNets, such that the collusion between the cloud and some mobiles does not weaken the protection for other mobiles.

To ensure reliable data transfer, LoRaWAN adopts retransmission mechanism where an unacknowledged packet is retransmitted multiple times in the hope of successfully delivering the packet at least once over harsh wireless channels. This retransmission mechanism is ill-suited for LoRa: 1) unsuccessful retransmissions lead to high power consumption for battery-powered LoRa nodes, and 2) a retransmission at another time does not necessarily improve the signal strength over harsh wireless channels. This paper presents the design and implementation of XCopy, which effectively improves the signal strength by coherently combining retransmitted packets received over weak links that would otherwise be thrown away. XCopy develops and puts together novel algorithms to 1) accurately identify the signal copies of the same packet over multiple retransmissions in the presence of interfering packets, and 2) precisely align the signal copies (in time, frequency, and phase) to ensure constructive combining, which turns out to be very challenging in ultra-low SNRs, but made possible by XCopy.

In this demo, we show the new-found walkways discovered by our system in Singapore through a custom visualization platform.", null, "When Pipelines Meet Fountain | CiNii Research CiNii \u56fd\u7acb\u60c5\u5831\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240 \u5b66\u8853\u60c5\u5831\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf[\u30b5\u30a4\u30cb\u30a3\n] \u8a73\u7d30\u3078\u79fb\u52d5 \u691c\u7d22\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3078\u79fb\u52d5 \u8ad6\u6587\u30fb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 \u5927\u5b66\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u306e\u672c\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587\u3092\n\u3055\u304c\u3059 English \u691c\u7d22 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb \u4eba\u7269/\u56e3\u4f53\u540d \u6240\u5c5e\u6a5f\u95a2 ISSN DOI \u671f\u9593 ~ \u672c\u6587\u30ea\u30f3\u30af \u672c\u6587\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u3042\u308a \n\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9 JaLC IRDB Crossref DataCite NDL NDL-Digital RUDA JDCat NINJAL CiNii \nArticles CiNii Books CiNii Dissertations DBpedia Nikkei BP KAKEN Integbio \u516c\u5171\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0 \n\u3059\u3079\u3066 \u7814\u7a76\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf \u8ad6\u6587 \u672c \u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587 \u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 When Pipelines Meet Fountain DOI Web Site \n\u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u6587\u732e1\u4ef6 Wan Du Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Jansen \nChristian Liando Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Huanle Zhang \nNanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Mo Li Nanyang Technological \nUniversity, Singapore, Singapore \u66f8\u8a8c\u4e8b\u9805 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u5225\u540d Fast Data Dissemination in Wireless \u2026", "The phone attitude is an essential input to many smartphone applications. Based on in-depth understanding of the nature of the MEMS gyroscope and other IMU sensors, we propose A3 - an accurate and automatic attitude detector for commodity smartphones. In the demo, we show the performance of our attitude tracking algorithm and its usability in attitude-based mobile applications.", null, "Advanced wireless sensing and networking techniques enable mobile sensing and actuating with ubiquitous computing on numerous smart sensors, mobile devices, RFIDs, and so forth, which revolutionize a variety of application areas with unprecedented pervasive physical world instrumentation. The development and deployment of such mobile sensing and actuating systems has become significant across a variety of application domains, including environmental surveillance, traffic and logistics, personal area networks, smart buildings, and emergent navigation. The major challenges come with the required system sustainability, mobility, scalability, and fault resilience in ensuring constant services across dynamic application environment. In this special issue, we have accepted a few papers that address the above key aspects in providing mobile sensing and actuating services.", "By processing a large dataset composed of daily trajectories of thousands of students in Singapore, we find that, instead of simply picking up students from their homes, an optimal school shuttle planning system needs to learn the real transportation usage and plan across all potential pickup locations for every student to generate need-satisfying routes. It is challenging, however, to perform route planning over a large number of students each having multiple potential pickup locations. We develop a graph-based data structure that embeds potential pickup locations of all students with the awareness of real-world constraints and existing public transits. Based on the graph structure, we prove that the optimal last-mile school shuttle planning problem is NP-hard and thereafter design a Tabu-based expansion algorithm to solve the problem, which strikes at a proper balance between the savings of students\u2019 commute time and the total cost of operating the shuttle buses. Extensive experiments with large-scale real-world crowdsensed trajectory data demonstrate that our last-mile school shuttles can save the traveling time for most students by over 20% and the savings can be up to 65% for 10% of the students."]}}
