To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers\u2019 data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers\u2019 requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain.

It enables various applications such as network management, quality of service (QoS) optimization, and system resilience enhancement. Pilot studies have investigated the possibilities of applying SDN on smart grid communications, while the specific benefits and risks that SDN may bring to the resilience of smart grids against accidental failures and malicious attacks remain largely unexplored. Without a systematic understanding of these issues and convincing validations of proposed solutions, the power industry will be unlikely to embrace SDN, since resilience is always a key consideration for critical infrastructures like power grids. In this position paper, we aim to provide an initial understanding of these issues, by investigating (1) how SDN can enhance the\u00a0\u2026", "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly available for critical applications such as security surveillance and environmental monitoring. An important performance measure of such applications is sensing coverage that characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on sensing coverage are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of coverage based on stochastic data fusion models that fuse noisy measurements of multiple sensors.

Attacks on the sensor measurements for AGC can cause frequency excursion that triggers remedial actions, such as disconnecting customer loads or generators, leading to blackouts, and potentially costly equipment damage. We derive an attack impact model and analyze an optimal attack, consisting of a series of FDIs that minimizes the remaining time until the onset of disruptive remedial actions, leaving the shortest time for the grid to counteract. We show that, based on eavesdropped sensor data and a few feasible-to-obtain system constants, the attacker can learn the attack impact model and achieve the optimal attack in practice.

An optimal movement scheduling method with mobile elements (MEs) is proposed to address limitations of static WSNs in node localization. In this scheme, a mobile anchor node cooperates with static sensor nodes and moves actively to refine location performance. It takes advantage of cooperation between MEs and static sensors while, at the same time, taking into account the relay node availability to make the best use of beacon signals. For achieving high localization accuracy and coverage, a novel convex position estimation algorithm is proposed, which can effectively solve the problem when infeasible points occur because of the effects of radio irregularity and obstacles. This method is the only rangefree based convex method to solve the localization\u00a0\u2026", "Recent research has proposed a moving target defense (MTD) approach that actively changes transmission line susceptance to preclude stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks against the state estimation of a smart grid. However, existing studies were often conducted under a weak adversarial setting, in that they ignore the possibility that alert attackers can also try to detect the activation of MTD before they launch the FDI attacks. We call this new threat as parameter confirming-first (PCF) FDI. To improve the stealthiness of MTD, we propose a hidden MTD approach that cannot be detected by the attackers and prove its equivalence to an MTD that maintains the power flows of the whole grid. Moreover, we analyze the completeness of MTD and show that any hidden MTD is incomplete in that FDI attacks may bypass the hidden MTD opportunistically. This result suggests that the stealthiness and completeness are\u00a0\u2026", "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly available for critical applications such as security surveillance and environmental monitoring.

This paper studies the impact of integrity attacks on real-time pricing (RTP), a key feature of smart grids that uses such technologies to improve system efficiency. Recent studies have shown that RTP creates a closed loop formed by the mutually dependent real-time price signals and price-taking demand. Such a closed loop can be exploited by an adversary whose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. Specifically, small malicious modifications to the price signals can be iteratively amplified by the closed loop, causing inefficiency and even severe failures such as blackouts. This paper adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the fundamental conditions of RTP stability under two broad classes of integrity attacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks.

However, traditional surveys cannot reflect the actual conditions of customers\u2019 due to the limited questions. Besides, survey results are affected by various subjective factors. In contrast, the recorded usages of IoT devices reflect customers\u2019 behaviours more comprehensively and accurately. We design an intelligent system to help IoT device manufacturers to take advantage of customers\u2019 data and build a machine learning model to predict customers\u2019 requirements and possible consumption behaviours with federated learning (FL) technology. The FL consists of two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model using the phone and the edge computing server collaboratively. The mobile edge computing server\u2019s high computation power can assist customers\u2019 training locally. Customers first collect data from various IoT devices using phones, and then download and train the initial model with their data. During the training, customers first extract features using their mobiles, and then add the Laplacian noise to the extracted features based on differential privacy, a formal and popular notion to quantify privacy. After achieving the local model, customers sign on their models respectively and send them to the blockchain. We use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator which belongs to the third party in FL. In the second stage, miners calculate the averaged model using the collected models sent from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing job, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model\u00a0\u2026", "Volcano monitoring is of great interest to public safety and scientific explorations. However, traditional volcanic instrumentation such as broadband seismometers are expensive, power-hungry, bulky, and difficult to install. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) offer the potential to monitor volcanoes at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, current volcanic WSN systems often yield poor monitoring quality due to the limited sensing capability of low-cost sensors and unpredictable dynamics of volcanic activities. Moreover, they are designed only for short-term monitoring due to the high energy consumption of centralized data collection. In this paper, we propose a novel quality-driven approach to achieving real-time, in-situ, and long-lived volcanic earthquake detection.

These applications often impose stringent Quality-of-Service requirements including high detection probability, low false alarm rate, and bounded detection delay. Although a dense all-static network may initially meet these Quality-of-Service requirements, it does not adapt to unpredictable dynamics in network conditions (e.g., coverage holes caused by death of nodes) or physical environments (e.g., changed spatial distribution of events).

From our extensive measurements, the channel activity detection feature that was recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access protocol that we refer to as LMAC for LoRa networks. This article presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implement carrier-sense multiple access, and balance the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes\u2019 local information and then additionally the gateway\u2019s global information.

This paper studies the problem of picking arrival times of primary waves (i.e., P-phases) received by seismic sensors, one of the most critical tasks in volcano monitoring. Two fundamental challenges must be addressed. First, it is virtually impossible to download the real-time high-frequency seismic data to a central station for P-phase picking due to limited wireless network bandwidth. Second, accurate P-phase picking is inherently computation-intensive, and is thus prohibitive for many low-power sensor platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a new P-phase picking approach for hierarchical volcano monitoring WSNs where a large number of inexpensive sensors are used to collect fine-grained, real-time seismic signals while a small number of powerful coordinator nodes\u00a0\u2026", "Recent cybersecurity incidents such as Stuxnet and Irongate alert us to the threats faced by critical cyber-physical systems. These attacks compromise the control signals to push the system to unsafe regions and meanwhile, inject fake sensor measurements to cover the ongoing attack. Detecting these Stuxnet-like (SL) attacks still remains an open research issue. This paper analyzes the taxonomy, construction, and implication of SL attacks in CPS control loops. We propose to apply the moving target defense (MTD) approach that actively changes the system configuration to detect SL attacks, since these attacks are generally constructed based on the knowledge about the system's configuration. We analyze the basic conditions for MTD to be successful. Finally, as a case study, we apply MTD for the secondary voltage control of power grids and present simulation results based on the IEEE 39-bus test system under\u00a0\u2026", "Data centers have become a critical computing infrastructure in the era of cloud computing.

This paper presents a novel cyber-physical approach for temperature forecasting in data centers, which integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, in situ wireless sensing, and real-time data-driven prediction. To ensure the forecasting fidelity, we leverage the realistic physical thermodynamic models of CFD to generate transient temperature distribution and calibrate it using sensor feedback. Both simulated temperature distribution and sensor measurements are then used to train a real-time prediction algorithm. As a result, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of online temperature modeling and prediction, which enables a\u00a0\u2026", "Wireless sensor networks are typically composed of low-cost sensors that are deeply integrated in physical environments. As a result, the sensing performance of a wireless sensor network is inevitably undermined by biases in imperfect sensor hardware and the noises in data measurements.

In this article, we propose a two-tier system-level calibration approach for a class of sensor networks that employ data fusion to improve the sensing performance. In the first tier of our calibration approach, each sensor learns its local sensing model from noisy measurements using an online algorithm and only transmits a few model parameters. In the second tier, sensors' local sensing models are then calibrated to a common system\u00a0\u2026", "Volcano monitoring is of great interest to public safety and scientific explorations.

Several existing systems achieve this goal by exploiting appliances' power usage signatures identified in labor-intensive in situ training processes. Recent work shows that autonomous power usage monitoring can be achieved by supplementing a smart meter with distributed sensors that detect the working states of appliances. However, sensors must be carefully installed for each appliance, resulting in high installation cost. This paper presents Supero - the first ad hoc sensor system that can monitor appliance power usage without supervised training. By exploiting multisensor fusion and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Supero can classify the appliance events of interest and autonomously associate measured power usage with the respective appliances.

A heuristic background components selection rule is developed to make pixel classification decision based on the proposed model. Our approach is demonstrated to be more adaptive, accurate and robust than some existing similar pixel modeling approaches through experimental results.", "In this paper we advocate the use of workflow---describing how a system provides its intended functionality---as a pillar of cybersecurity analysis and propose a holistic workflow-oriented assessment framework. While workflow models are currently used in the area of performance and reliability assessment, these approaches are designed neither to assess a system in the presence of an active attacker, nor to assess security aspects such as confidentiality. On the other hand, existing security assessment methods typically focus on modeling the active attacker (e.g., attack graphs), but many rely on restrictive models that are not readily applicable to complex (e.g., cyber-physical or cyber-human) systems.

Following this approach, we develop Blink and Flicker -- two practical systems for detecting wireless spy cameras. Blink is a lightweight app that can be deployed on off-the-shelf mobile devices. It asks the user to turn on/off the light of her private space, and then uses the light sensor and the wireless radio of the mobile device to identify the response of wireless cameras.

Extensive experiments verify the above property and show that TouchAuth achieves high-profile receiver operating characteristics in implementing the touch-to-access policy.

A basis of this work is a measurement study showing that the power network EMF sensed by either a customized sensor or smartphone's microphone as a side-channel sensor is spatially distinct and temporally stable. Based on this, we design a SLAM approach that can reliably detect loop closures based on EMF sensing results. With the EMF feature map constructed by SLAM, we also design an efficient online localization scheme for resource-constrained mobiles.

This paper explores efficient use of mobile sensors to address limitations of static WSNs for target detection. We propose a data-fusion-based detection model that enables static and mobile sensors to effectively collaborate in target detection.

However, the sensing-based synchronization may yield faults due to nonmalicious signal and sensor noises. This paper considers a system of N nodes that will fuse their peer-to-peer synchronization results to correct the faults. Our analysis gives the lower bound of the number of faults that the system can tolerate when N is up to 12. If the number of faults is no greater than the lower bound, the faults can be identified and corrected. We also prove that the system cannot tolerate more than N - 2 faults. Our results can guide the design of resilient sensing-based clock synchronization systems.", "Load shedding can combat the overload of a power grid that may jeopardize the grid\u2019s safety. However, disconnected customers may be excessively inconvenienced or even endangered. With the emergence of demand-response based on cyber-enabled smart meters and appliances, customers may participate in solving the overload by curtailing their demands collaboratively such that no single customers will have to bear a disproportionate burden of reduced usage. However, compliance or commitment to curtailment requests by untrusted users is uncertain, which causes an important safety concern. This article proposes a two-phase load management scheme that (i) gives customers a chance to curtail their demands and correct a grid\u2019s overload when there are no immediate safety concerns but (ii) falls back to load shedding to ensure safety once the grid enters a vulnerable state.

This article presents a novel representation learning model that can make use of unlabeled IMU data and extract generalized rather than task-specific features. With the representations learned via our model, task-specific models trained with limited labeled samples can achieve superior performances in typical IMU sensing applications, such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR).", "Voltage stability assessment is essential for maintaining reliable power grid operations. Stability assessment approaches using deep learning address the shortfalls of the traditional time-domain simulation-based approaches caused by increased system complexity. However, deep learning models are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples in the field of computer vision. While this vulnerability has been noticed by the power grid cybersecurity research, the domain-specific analysis on the requirements imposed upon effective attack implementation is still lacking. Although these attack requirements are usually reasonable in computer vision tasks, they can be stringent in the context of power grids.

However, the use of these technologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service disruptions. In this paper, we study false data injection (FDI) attacks against railways' traction power systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor measurements - which we call efficiency attack and safety attack -- that (i) maximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local voltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To counteract, we develop a global attack detection (GAD) system that serializes a bad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection system can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current measurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS, attack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system features an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative rates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive simulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS setup is vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false positive rate.", "The continuous fluctuation of electric network frequency (ENF) presents a fingerprint indicative of time, which we call natural timestamp.

The evaluation in our prior studies [1, 3] has shown that the natural timestamps recorded by the voltage sensors and the EMR sensors give sub-millisecond and sub-second average time errors, respectively. This demo will also show their time errors.", "When a power grid is overloaded, load shedding is a conventional approach to combating the imbalance between supply and demand that jeopardizes the grid safety. However, disconnected customers may suffer discomfort and even endangerment. With the emergence of demand response involving cyber-enabled smart meters and appliances, customers can participate in coping with the imbalance by curtailing their demands, such that the impact of temporary undersupply will be more bearable and fair to customers. However, relying purely on the uncertain demand response, which is affected by variable quality of smart devices and commitment of customers, must largely weaken the assurance for grid safety. This paper proposes a two-phase load management scheme that encourages the customers to curtail their demands to mitigate the increasing tension of undersupply when there are no immediate safety concerns, and falls back to load shedding to ensure safety when the grid is drifting to a vulnerable state. Extensive simulations based on a 37-bus system and real load data traces demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme. In particular, the results show that if customers commit to the load curtailment schedules, the chance of the tough load shedding can be effectively reduced.", "Water resources and aquatic ecosystems are fac-ing increasing threats from climate change, improper waste disposal, and oil spill incidents. It is of great interest to deploy mobile sensor networks to detect and monitor the (eg, chemical pollutants or oil) diffusion processes that are harmful to aquatic environments.

In our approach, the mobile sensors collaboratively profile the characteristics of a diffusion including source location, pollution amount, and its evolution over time. In particular, the mobile sensors reposition themselves to progressively improve the profiling accuracy. We formally formulate a novel movement scheduling problem that aims to maximize the profiling accuracy subject to limited sensor mobility and energy budget. We develop a light-weight greedy algorithm as well as a more complex near-optimal algorithm to solve the problem.

However, many existing fusion schemes do not consider the quality of each fusion input and may suffer from adverse conditions on one or more sensors. While predictive uncertainty has been applied to characterize single-modal object detection performance at run time, incorporating uncertainties into the multi-modal fusion still lacks effective solutions due primarily to the uncertainty's cross-modal incomparability and distinct sensitivities to various adverse conditions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Uncertainty-Encoded Mixture-of-Experts (UMoE) that explicitly incorporates single-modal uncertainties into LiDAR-camera fusion. UMoE uses individual expert network to process each sensor's detection result together with encoded uncertainty. Then, the expert networks' outputs are analyzed by a gating network to determine the fusion weights. The proposed UMoE module can be integrated into any proposal fusion pipeline. Evaluation shows that UMoE achieves a maximum of 10.67%, 3.17%, and 5.40% performance gain compared with the state-of-the-art proposal-level multi-modal object detectors under extreme weather, adversarial, and blinding attack scenarios.", "Intelligent vehicles with increasing complexity face cybersecurity threats.

A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a\u00a0\u2026", null, null, "LMAC | CiNii Research CiNii \u56fd\u7acb\u60c5\u5831\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240 \u5b66\u8853\u60c5\u5831\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf[\u30b5\u30a4\u30cb\u30a3] \u8a73\u7d30\u3078\u79fb\u52d5 \u691c\u7d22\n\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3078\u79fb\u52d5 \u8ad6\u6587\u30fb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 \u5927\u5b66\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u306e\u672c\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 English \n\u691c\u7d22 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb \u4eba\u7269/\u56e3\u4f53\u540d \u6240\u5c5e\u6a5f\u95a2 ISSN DOI \u671f\u9593 ~ \u672c\u6587\u30ea\u30f3\u30af \u672c\u6587\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u3042\u308a \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9 \nJaLC IRDB Crossref DataCite NDL NDL-Digital RUDA JDCat NINJAL CiNii Articles CiNii \nBooks CiNii Dissertations DBpedia Nikkei BP KAKEN Integbio \u516c\u5171\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0 \u3059\u3079\u3066 \u7814\u7a76\n\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf \u8ad6\u6587 \u672c \u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587 \u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 LMAC DOI Web Site \u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u6587\u732e1\u4ef6 Amalinda Gamage \nNanyang Technological University, Singpore Jansen Christian Liando Nanyang \nTechnological University, Singpore Chaojie Gu Nanyang Technological University, \nSingpore Rui Tan Nanyang Technological University, Singpore Mo Li Nanyang \nTechnological University, Singpore \u66f8\u8a8c\u4e8b\u9805 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u5225\u540d efficient carrier-sense multiple \naccess for LoRa \u53ce\u9332\u520a\u884c\u7269 Proceedings of the \u2026", "Many data centers still adopt low temperature setpoints, resulting in high energy consumption of their cooling systems. In our ongoing research project, we have built a data center testbed consisting of three test rooms hosting servers and network equipment. In particular, the testbed is equipped with cooling, heating, and ventilation systems that are under our full control. Thus, we can operate the testbed in a wide range of server room conditions. The test rooms and servers are instrumented with hardware and software sensors monitoring more than 200 measurement points. An extensive test plan is being executed to collect a large volume of data to understand the impact of environmental conditions on server's computing performance and reliability as well as the energy efficiency of the testbed. The results will provide important guidelines for building and operating energy-efficient data centers. We will work with\u00a0\u2026", "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly available for critical applications such as security surveillance and environmental monitoring. As a fundamental performance measure of WSNs, coverage characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Two facets of coverage, i.e., spatial coverage and temporal coverage, quantify the percentage of area that is well monitored by the network and the timeliness of the network in detecting targets appearing in the sensing field, respectively. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on spatiotemporal coverage of WSNs are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this chapter, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of spatiotemporal coverage based on\u00a0\u2026", "Rapid developments of the electronic information industry promote energy usages of cooling system in data centers to be paid extensive attention, especially in the tropical environment. The study experimentally conducts the key issues and assessments of energy-saving operations of tropical data center at system and component levels from the perspectives of thermodynamics, economics, and thermoeconomics. Comprehensive assessments of supply air temperature, outdoor air temperature, and operation modes in tropical data center are discussed and compared. Operation modes of compression vary with the setpoints of supply air temperature. The alternate operation easily appears in multiple compressors, inevitably increasing the exergy loss & destruction of data centers. As supply air temperature rises from 20 C to 32 C, average hourly energy cost of cooling system decreases 37.8%. Also, high supply air temperature and low refrigerant charges have significant exergy costing advantages over resisting the impacts of outdoor air temperature changes. Based on them, practical operation strategies for dynamic adjustment of supply air temperature have been proposed to cope with impacts of the tropical high-temperature environment. The results reveal that the average energy savings values are 0.7%~ 2.8%, which provides the feasibility of making full use of outdoor conditions and indoor parameters.", "The rapid development of the electronic information industry promotes the energy usage of the cooling system in data centers (DCs) to be paid extensive attention, especially in the tropical environment. The study experimentally conducts the key issues and assessments of energy-saving operations of the tropical data center (TDC) at system and component levels from the perspectives of thermodynamics, economics, and thermoeconomics. Comprehensive assessments of supply air temperature (SAT), outdoor air temperature (OAT), and operation modes in TDC are discussed and compared. The operation modes of compression vary with the setpoints of SAT. The alternate operation easily appears in multiple compressors, inevitably increasing the exergy loss & destruction of DCs. As the SAT increases from 20 C to 32 C, the average hourly energy cost of the cooling system decreases from SGD 3.7 to 2.3. Also, high SAT and low refrigerant charges have significant exergy costing advantages over resisting the impacts of OAT changes. Based on them, practical operation strategies for dynamic adjustment of SAT have been proposed to cope with the impacts of the tropical high-temperature environment. The results reveal that the average energy savings values are 0.7%~ 2.8%, which provides the feasibility of making full use of outdoor conditions and indoor parameters."]}}
