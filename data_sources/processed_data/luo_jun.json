Building upon this foundation, his research team has made contributions on mobile/ pervasive computing and smart sensing technologies, by leading several national research projects and corporate labs, aiming to transfer the research outcomes to practical applications. In the meantime, Dr. Luo and his team have kept publishing at relevant venues such as IEEE and ACM top conferences and journals, including MobiCom, CVPR, SenSys, INFOCOM, UbiComp, ToN, and TMC. With only 130+ publications, he has earned over 8300 Google Scholar citations, with two top-cited papers both bearing more than 1,000 of them.", "grants": "DeepWiSe: Deep-Interpreted Wireless Sensing
