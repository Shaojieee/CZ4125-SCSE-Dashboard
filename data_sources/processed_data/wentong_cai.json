He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Exeter (UK) in 1991.  He was a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Queen's University (Canada) before joining NTU as a Faculty Member in 1993. Prof Cai\u2019s expertise is mainly in the areas of Modelling and Simulation (particularly, modelling and simulation of large-scale complex systems, and system support for parallel and distributed simulation and distributed virtual environments).  He has published extensively in these areas and has received a number of best paper awards at the international conferences for his research (e.g., DS-RT\u201918, SIGSIM PADS\u201918, SIGSIM PADS\u201917, DS-RT\u201909, PADS\u201906, DS-RT\u201904, and ESS\u201903).  His recent research also involves using Agent-based Modelling techniques to understand the effect of individual behaviour on system-level dynamics and to develop scalable simulation applications (e.g., traffic and crowd simulation).He has been actively collaborating with Singapore industries (e.g., MPA, STEE, EADS, SAP, D-SIMLAB, and SGH) and research institutes (e.g., IHPC and SIMTech) on simulation projects.  Over his career, he has been successful in attracting competitive research funding from various funding agencies (e.g., MOE, A*STAR, NRF, and DSTA).  He has graduated 11 research Master and 15 PhD students as sole/main supervisor.  Prof Cai is a member of the IEEE and the ACM.  He has been an associate editor of the ACM Transactions on Modelling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) since 2007, an editor of the Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) since 2011.  He is also an editor of the Journal of Simulation (JOS).  He has chaired a number of international conferences in the areas of Modelling and Simulation, and Parallel and Distributed Computing.  Most recent ones include: SIGSIM PADS\u201917, DS-RT\u201915, CloudCom\u201914, ICPADS\u201912, and MACOTS\u201911.", "grants": "Development of 250mm CCV Digital Twin Using IoT Sensor Network

frequently studied by experts from various areas. Recently, computer-based modeling and simulation technologies have emerged to support investigation of the dynamics of crowds, such as a crowd's behaviors under normal and emergent situations. This article assesses the major existing technologies for crowd modeling and simulation. We first propose a two-dimensional categorization mechanism to classify existing work depending on the size of crowds and the time-scale of the crowd phenomena of interest. Four evaluation criteria have also been introduced to evaluate existing crowd simulation systems from the point of view of both a modeler and an end-user. We have discussed some influential existing work in crowd modeling and simulation regarding their major features, performance as well as the\u00a0\u2026", "Single-user interactive computer applications are pervasive in our daily lives and work. Leveraging single-user applications for supporting multi-user collaboration has the potential to significantly increase the availability and improve the usability of collaborative applications. In this article, we report an innovative Transparent Adaptation (TA) approach and associated supporting techniques that can be used to convert existing and new single-user applications into collaborative ones, without changing the source code of the original application. The cornerstone of the TA approach is the operational transformation (OT) technique and the method of adapting the single-user application programming interface to the data and operation models of OT. This approach and supporting techniques were developed and tested in the process of transparently converting two commercial off-the-shelf single-user applications\u00a0\u2026", "This paper describes a new, auto-adaptive algorithm for dead reckoning in DIS. In general dead-reckoning algorithms use a fixed threshold to control the extrapolation errors. Since a fixed threshold cannot adequately handle the dynamic relationships between moving entities, a multi-level threshold scheme is proposed. The definition of threshold levels is based on the concepts of area of interest (AOI) and sensitive region (SR), and the levels of threshold are adaptively adjusted based on the relative distance between entities during the simulation. Various experiments were conducted. The results show that the proposed auto-adaptive dead reckoning algorithm can achieve considerable reduction in update packets without sacrificing accuracy in extrapolation.", "Human crowd is a fascinating social phenomenon in nature. This paper presents our work on designing behavior model for virtual humans in a crowd simulation under normal\u2010life and emergency situations. Our model adopts an agent\u2010based approach and employs a layered framework to reflect the natural pattern of human\u2010like decision making process, which generally involves a person's awareness of the situation and consequent changes on the internal attributes. The social group and crowd\u2010related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory). By integrating our model into an agent execution process, each individual agent can response differently to the perceived environment and make realistic behavioral decisions based on various physiological, emotional, and social group attributes.

In this paper, we characterize this problem by quantifying the time-space inconsistency in a DVE. To this end, a metric is defined to measure the time-space inconsistency in a DVE. One major advantage of the metric is that it may be estimated based on some characteristic parameters of a DVE, such as clock asynchrony, message transmission delay, the accuracy of the dead reckoning algorithm, the kinetics of the moving entity, and human factors. Thus the metric can be used to evaluate the time-space consistency property of a DVE without the actual execution of the DVE application, which is especially useful in the design stage of a DVE. Our work also clearly shows how the characteristic parameters of a DVE are interrelated in deciding the time\u00a0\u2026", "Building a cost calculus for a parallel program development environment is difficult because of the many degrees of freedom available in parallel implementations and because of difficulties with compositionality. We present a strategy for building cost calculi for skeleton-based programming languages which can be used for derivational software development and which deals in a pragmatic way with the difficulties of composition. The approach is illustrated for the Bird-Meertens theory of lists, a parallel functional language with an associated equational transformation system.", "The effective practice of supply chain management (SCM) is crucial to improve corporations' competitive advantage. Many corporations have built simulation models to facilitate the application of simulation in designing, evaluating, and optimizing their supply chain. Traditionally, a supply chain involves only a single enterprise with multiple facilities and distribution centers. Hence, sharing of detailed simulation models is not a problem in this scenario. But in recent years, the scope of SCM has evolved to cross the enterprise boundaries. Applying simulation in designing, evaluating, and optimizing the supply chain becomes more difficult since the participating corporations might not be willing to share their simulation models with partners. Distributed simulation techniques are presented as an enabling technology that allows corporations to construct a cross enterprise simulation while hiding model details within the\u00a0\u2026", "Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm that has been widely used for solving many real-world optimization problems. However, traditional GP can only solve a single task in one independent run, which is inefficient in cases where multiple tasks need to be solved at the same time. Recently, multifactorial optimization (MFO) has been proposed as a new evolutionary paradigm toward evolutionary multitasking. It intends to conduct evolutionary search on multiple tasks in one independent run. To enable multitasking GP, in this paper, we propose a novel multifactorial GP (MFGP) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to conduct multitasking GP using a single population.

In order to support a large number of participants and to divide the workload, the virtual world is divided into partitions. Each partition is then assigned to a server. A client (ie, a player or a participant) will join a server according to the position of the avatar it controls. Compared to a centralized architecture, this distributed client-server architecture is more scalable. In addition, compared to a fully distributed, peer-to-peer architecture, it also provides a means for detecting cheating in distributed games. Since interactions and accounting information must be forwarded directly to one of the servers for qualification and verification, cheating amongst distributed players of the game will be minimized.

In contrast to the existing GEP variants, the proposed SL-GEP features a novel chromosome representation in which each chromosome is embedded with subfunctions that can be deployed to construct the final solution. As part of the chromosome, the subfunctions are self-learned or self-evolved by the proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. By encompassing subfunctions or any partial solution as input arguments of another subfunction, the proposed SL-GEP facilitates the formation of sophisticated, higher-order, and constructive subfunctions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of the search. Further, a novel search mechanism based on differential evolution is proposed for the evolution of chromosomes in the SL-GEP.

These resources may be from different organizations. The simulation may run for a long period of time and the availability and amount of computing resources available may change during the course of simulation execution. Therefore, coordinating and managing resources for distributed simulation to complete the simulation efficiently and effectively is a critical issue.

In this paper, we consider a new version of the DBP problem, namely, the MinTotal DBP problem which targets at minimizing the total cost of the bins used over time. It is motivated by the request dispatching problem arising in cloud gaming systems. We analyze the competitive ratios of the commonly used First Fit, Best Fit, and Any Fit packing (the family of packing algorithms that open a new bin only when no currently opened bin can accommodate the item to be packed) algorithms for the MinTotal DBP problem.

With the increase in the scale and complexity of simulations, large amounts of computational resources are required, and provisioning of the services is becoming increasingly difficult. The grid provides a platform for coordinated resource sharing and application development and execution. In this paper, we focus on extending the high level architecture (HLA) to the grid. More specifically, we propose a distributed simulation framework, called HLAGrid. The framework uses a Federate-Proxy-RTI architecture, which allows resources on the grid to be utilized on demand by using grid services. The architecture also supports federation discovery, security of the simulator logic, and flexible federation construction, such as hierarchical federations. The architecture hides the heterogeneity of the simulators, simulators' execution platforms\u00a0\u2026", "The development of many complex simulation applications requires collaborative effort from researchers with different domain knowledge and expertise, possibly at different locations. These simulation systems often require huge computing resources and data sets, which can be geographically distributed.

The emergence of Grid technologies provides exciting new opportunities for large-scale distributed simulation, enabling collaboration and the use of distributed computing resources, while also facilitating access to geographically distributed data sets.

We present a load balancing scheme that combines both static partitioning and dynamic load balancing. The static partitioning scheme maps simulation objects to logical processes before simulation starts while the dynamic load balancing scheme attempts to balance the load during runtime. The static scheme involves two steps. First, the simulation objects that contribute to small lookahead are merged together by using a merging algorithm. Then a partitioning algorithm is applied. The merging is needed to ensure a consistent performance for our dynamic scheme. Our dynamic scheme is tailor-made for an asynchronous simulation protocol that does not rely on null messages. The performance study on a supply chain simulation shows that the partitioning algorithm and dynamic load balancing are important in\u00a0\u2026", "Previous research has proposed several different load-balancing strategies and measured their performances on either a distributed system or a multiprocessor network of specific topology. The authors broadly classify all load-balancing strategies as being either static or dynamic. For certain applications, dynamic load balancing is preferable, because then the problem's variable behavior more closely matches available computational resources. The authors address the performance of five dynamic load-balancing strategies: the Gradient Model strategy, the Sender-Initiated and Receiver-Initiated strategies, the Central Job Dispatcher strategy, and the Prediction-based strategy. The authors use a trace-driven simulation approach, collecting job traces from a production-distributed computer system and using them to simulate a loosely coupled multiprocessor network.

Redundancy is part of the SC re-engineering to improve supply chain resilience (SCRES). This paper presents a conceptual model of an SCN using graph theory, considering the relationships between plants and materials. Based on the model, the structural redundancy of the SCN is measured, which is used to assess SCRES. This assessment approach focuses on the resilience of the SCN against disruptions. Case studies are discussed to illustrate the applicability of this model and show that increasing structural redundancy of the SCN improves SCRES against disruptions.", "Macroscopic and microscopic modeling have become mainstream methodologies for crowd simulation in dynamic environments. The two models make a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, but neither of them is able to achieve both goals at the same time. With the aim of achieving both efficiency and accuracy, a hybrid modelling method is proposed in this paper for crowd simulation. This paper illustrates how the two types of models co-exist in a single simulation and work collaboratively. A case study for this method is also conducted, the simulation result of which shows that the proposed method can not only benefit from the macroscopic model by improving the simulation efficiency, but also obtain a fine-grained simulation result by adopting the microscopic model.", "Although various forms of symbiosis are known in biology, only mutualism has been considered in the context of symbiotic simulation systems. In this paper, we explain why the original definition of symbiotic simulation systems is narrow and why it is important to consider other forms of symbiosis as well. As a consequence we propose an extended definition of symbiotic simulation systems motivated by symbiosis in biology. By using this extended definition, we identify five different types of symbiotic simulation systems which can be applied in various applications. We describe how single systems can be combined and propose a hybrid symbiotic simulation system in the context of semiconductor manufacturing.", "Symbiotic simulation is a paradigm in which a simulation system and a physical system are closely associated with each other. This close relationship can be mutually beneficial. The simulation system benefits from real-time measurements about the physical system which are provided by corresponding sensors. The physical system, on the other side, may benefit from the effects of decisions made by the simulation system. An important concept in symbiotic simulation is that of the what-if analysis process which is concerned with the evaluation of a number of what-if scenarios by means of simulation. Symbiotic simulation and related paradigms have become popular in recent years because of their ability to dynamically incorporate real-time sensor data.

This paper presents a simulation model that includes network structural properties in the analysis of SCRES. This simulation model extends an existing graph model to consider operational behaviours in order to capture disruption-recovery dynamics. Through structural analysis of a supply chain network (SCN), mitigation strategies are designed to build redundancy, while contingency strategies are developed to prioritise recovery of the affected SCN. SCRES indexes are proposed by sampling SC performance measures of disruption for each plant and aggregating the measures based on the criticality of the plants in the SCN.

Workstation computers have only limited capabilities of delivering results for large-scale simulations. This leads to the problem that many researchers and engineers have to either reduce the scope of their experiments or fail to execute as many experiments as they would like in a given time frame. The use of high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure offers a solution to the problem. Users of such simulations are often domain experts with no or little experience with HPC environments. In addition users do not necessarily have access to an HPC.

One of the significant and challenging tasks in agent-based crowd modelling is the design of decision rules for agents, so as to reproduce desired emergent phenomena behaviors. The common approach in agent-based crowd modelling is to design decision rules empirically based on model developer\u2019s experiences and domain specific knowledge. In this paper, an evolutionary framework is proposed to automatically extract decision rules for agent-based crowd models, so as to reproduce an objective crowd behavior. To automate the rule extraction process, the problem of finding optimal decision rules from objective crowd behaviors is formulated as a symbolic regression problem. An evolutionary framework based on gene expression programming is developed to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is tested using crowd evacuation simulations in three scenarios with differing complexity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and shows that our algorithm is able to find decision rules for agents, which in turn can generate the prescribed macro-scale dynamics.", "A number of research issues arise in executing large scale High Level Architecture (HLA) based distributed simulations.

Large scale distributed simulation, in which federates run on many heterogenous computing machines may benefit from migrating federates among these machines for load- balancing and fault-tolerance. However, the HLA framework does not provide formal support for federate migration currently. We have previously developed a Service Oriented HLA RTL (SOHR) framework, which provides HLA RTL functionalities via the cooperation of a set of Grid services. SOHR is developed with migration support features by using a decoupled federate design. In this paper, a basic federate migration protocol is first proposed to illustrate the process of federate migration in SOHR.

With increased size and complexity of simulation applications, large amounts of distributed computational and data resources are required. The Grid provides a flexible, secure and coordinated resource sharing environment which can facilitate distributed simulation execution.

Each job has a size that defines the resource demand for running the job. Each job is assigned to run on a cloud server upon its arrival and the job departs after it completes. The departure time of a job, however, is not known at the time of its arrival. Each cloud server has a fixed resource capacity and the total resource demand of all the jobs running on a server cannot exceed its capacity at all times. The objective of job dispatching is to minimize the total cost of the servers used, where the cost of renting each cloud server is proportional to its running hours by \"pay-as-you-go\" billing.

Based on the dual-layer mechanism, an automatic learning method is proposed to learn the model components from video data. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed framework is applied to generate the crowd behaviors in New York Grand Central Terminal. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to construct effective model that can generate the desired emergent crowd behaviors and can offer promising prediction performance.", "Cloud gaming is becoming increasingly popular. The basic idea of cloud gaming is to run games on cloud servers and let players interact with games through thin clients. As the player population grows, the cloud gaming service provider needs to maintain a large number of cloud servers for running the game instances requested by the players. A primary concern of the cloud gaming service provider is the total running cost of the cloud servers. In this paper, we study the problem of how to dispatch the play requests to the cloud servers in a cloud gaming system. We show that the dispatching strategy of play requests may heavily affect the total service cost of the cloud gaming system.

Distributed NE is based on a new heuristic, called parallel expansion, where each partition is constructed in parallel by greedily expanding its edge set from a single vertex in such a way that the increase of the vertex cuts becomes local minimal. We theoretically prove that the proposed method has the upper bound in the partitioning quality. The empirical evaluation with various graphs shows that the proposed method produces higher-quality partitions than the state-of-the-art distributed graph partitioning algorithms. The performance evaluation shows that the space efficiency of the proposed method is an order-of-magnitude better than the existing algorithms, keeping its time efficiency comparable. As a result, Distributed NE can partition a trillion-edge graph using only 256 machines within 70 minutes.", "Due to decelerating gains in single-core CPU performance, computationally expensive simulations are increasingly executed on highly parallel hardware platforms. Agent-based simulations, where simulated entities act with a certain degree of autonomy, frequently provide ample opportunities for parallelisation. Thus, a vast variety of approaches proposed in the literature demonstrated considerable performance gains using hardware platforms such as many-core CPUs and GPUs, merged CPU-GPU chips as well as Field Programmable Gate Arrays. Typically, a combination of techniques is required to achieve high performance for a given simulation model, putting substantial burden on modellers.

In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem.

This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to automate the crowd model calibration process. In the proposed framework, a density-based matching scheme is introduced. By using the dynamic density of the crowd over time, and a weight landscape to emphasize important spatial regions, the proposed matching scheme provides a generally applicable way to evaluate the simulated crowd behaviors.

It supports the rational and dynamic allocation of ambulances and hospital staffing, and ensures patients have timely access to such resources. However, this task has been challenging due to complex multi-nature dependencies and nonlinear dynamics within ambulance demand, such as spatial characteristics involving the region of the city at which the demand is estimated, short and long-term historical demands, as well as the demographics of a region. Machine learning techniques are thus useful to quantify these characteristics of ambulance demand. However, there is generally a lack of studies that use machine learning tools for a comprehensive modeling of the important demand dependencies to predict ambulance demands. In this paper, an original and novel approach that leverages machine learning tools and extraction of features based on the multi-nature insights of ambulance demands is proposed. We experimentally evaluate the performance of next-day demand prediction across several state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and ambulance demand prediction methods, using real-world ambulatory and demographical datasets obtained from Singapore. We also provide an analysis of this ambulatory dataset and demonstrate the accuracy in modeling dependencies of different natures using various machine learning techniques.", "This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm named differential evolution with sensitivity analysis and the Powell's method (DESAP) for model calibration. The proposed DESAP owns three main features. First, an entropy-based sensitivity analysis operation is introduced to dynamically identify important parameters of the model as evolution progresses online. Second, the Powell's method is performed periodically to fine-tune the important parameters of the best individual in the population. Finally, in each generation, the evolutionary operators are performed on a small number of better individuals in the population. These new search mechanisms are integrated into the differential evolution framework to improve the search efficiency.

We cluster the examples before the simulation to find similar patterns of behavior. During the simulation, at each simulation time step, we first classify the input state perceived by an agent in the simulation into one example cluster using an artificial neural network classifier. We then combine similar examples of that cluster to produce an output, a velocity vector indicating the position of the agent in the next time step. Such a two step matching process enables the selection of the most similar example accurately and efficiently.

The constructed crowd model can generate crowd behaviors that match those observed in the video and can be used to predict trajectories of pedestrians in the same scenario. In the proposed framework, a dual-layer architecture is proposed to model crowd behaviors. The bottom layer models the microscopic collision avoidance behaviors, while the top layer models the macroscopic crowd behaviors such as the goal selection patterns and the path navigation patterns. An automatic learning algorithm is proposed to learn behavior patterns from video data. The learned behavior patterns are then integrated into the dual-layer architecture to generate realistic crowd behaviors.

Each job has a size that defines the resource demand for running the job. Each job is assigned to run on a cloud server upon its arrival and the job departs after it completes. The departure time of a job, however, is not known at the time of its arrival. Each cloud server has a fixed resource capacity and the total resource demand of all the jobs running on a server cannot exceed its capacity at all times. The objective of job dispatching is to minimize the total cost of the servers used, where the cost of renting each cloud server is proportional to its running hours by \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d billing.

The basic idea of the logical clock approach is to introduce a logical clock for each process which can reflect the real time execution of that process when running without monitoring, and to control the inter-process communication according to logical time rather than real time.

Each analyzer allows us to study how the speedup of a model changes with increasing number of processors, when a specific protocol is used. The third tool-a critical path analyzer-gives on ideal upper bound to the model's speedup.

The properties of intensive resource demands and dynamic workloads make cloud gaming appropriate to be supported by an elastic cloud platform. Facing a large user population, a fundamental problem is how to provide satisfactory cloud gaming service at modest cost. We observe that the software storage cost could be substantial compared to the server running cost in cloud gaming using elastic cloud resources. Therefore, in this article, we address the server provisioning problem for cloud gaming to optimize both the server running cost and the software storage cost.

One of the problems with causal order delivery algorithms is the need to attach the dependency information with each message to ensure the causal ordering of delivery. This introduces a large amount of overhead and limits the scalability of the algorithm. To reduce the amount of dependency information, an algorithm was proposed by Prakash to attach only direct dependency information to the messages. The algorithm is optimal in a broadcast environment. However, in a multicast environment, it fails to eliminate indirect dependencies in some cases. In this paper, an improved causal order delivery algorithm that eliminates indirect dependencies in a broadcast as well as a multicast environment is proposed. The new algorithm is analyzed against Prakash's algorithm in terms of optimality on eliminating indirect dependencies\u00a0\u2026", "Generating suitable game scenarios that can cater for individual players has become an emerging challenge in procedural content generation.

However, existing work has only focused on geographic partitioning methods which do not consider the minimization of communication overhead. In this paper, a graph-based dynamic load-balancing mechanism which minimizes the communication overhead during load-balancing operations is developed. Its efficiency is investigated in the agent-based traffic simulator SEMSim Traffic using real world traffic data. Experiment results show that it has significantly better performance than static graph partitioning methods in improving the overall speed of the simulation.", "Evolutionary algorithms can efficiently solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) by obtaining diverse and near-optimal solution sets. However, the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is often limited by the suitability of their corresponding parameter settings with respect to different optimization problems. The tuning of the parameters is a crucial task which concerns resolving the conflicting goals of convergence and diversity. Moreover, parameter tuning is a time-consuming trial-and-error optimization process which restricts the applicability of MOEAs to provide real-time decision support. To address this issue, we propose a self-adaptive mechanism (SAM) to exploit and optimize the balance between exploration and exploitation during the evolutionary search. This \u201cexplore first and exploit later\u201d approach is addressed through the automated and dynamic adjustment of the distribution index of the simulated binary crossover (SBX) operator.

Even though today heterogeneous hardware comprised of CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs) and fused CPU-GPU devices is inexpensive and widely available, common traffic simulators still rely purely on CPU-based execution, leaving substantial acceleration potentials untapped. A number of existing works have considered the execution of traffic simulations on accelerators, but have relied on simplified models of road networks and driver behaviour tailored to the given hardware platform.

In this paper, we propose two algorithms, pullRO and pushRO, that allow one to replace some of the timestamp order (TSO) messages (possibly those causing zero lookahead values) with receive order (RO) messages. This removes the time constraint that these messages impose on the lower bound timestamp calculation, which in turn will improve the time advancement rate of federates.

The technology aims to enable the examination of alternative scenarios concurrently within the same simulation execution session. State saving and recovery are necessary for cloning a federate at runtime. However it is very difficult to have a generic state manipulation mechanism for any existing federate, as these can be developed independently and freely. The correctness of replicating a running federate significantly depends on the Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) software. The distributed simulation also needs fault tolerance to provide robustness at runtime. This paper proposes a decoupled federate architecture to address the above issues. A normal federate is decoupled into two processes, which execute the simulation model (virtual federate) and the local RTI component (physical federate) respectively. The decoupled approach interlinks the two processes together via Inter-Process Communication. The virtual federate interacts with the RTI through the standard RTI service interface supported by a customized library. The decoupled architecture ensures the correct replication of federates and facilitates fault tolerance at the RTI level. At the same time, it provides user transparency and reusability to existing federate codes. Benchmark experiments have been performed to study the extra overhead incurred by the decoupled federate architecture against the normal federate.

We prove that with conformance to specific rules regulating the advancement of LPs, the events to be cancelled by a straggler message can be determined using a range of the state vector. Thus, knowledge of the range enables any LP to recover from the receipt of a straggler message at the cost of at most one rollback (i.e., rollback optimal).

From our formalization, we conceptually show that agent homogeneity and load-based pricing schemes on shared resources can help achieve this requirement.", "In distributed wargame simulations, the states of simulation entities need to be updated and sent to other simulation nodes in a timely manner, which may incur high overhead on the network. Thus, how to efficiently use the limited bandwidth of the network is very important to the performance of distributed wargame simulations. In this paper, a utility model is proposed to evaluate the relative importance of a simulation entity. In our proposed utility model, the utility of an entity is determined by the number of entities on which this entity may have influence and the distances between this entity and the entities within its area of influence. Based on the utility model, we may devise some flexible updating mechanisms which can utilize the bandwidth more efficiently. For example, the state updates of an important entity which may have nodes with a high frequency; on the other hand, the state updates of an entity with little\u00a0\u2026", "One of the main reasons why parallel discrete event simulution hus not been adopted more widely in industry is that the terminology used by the parallel simulution community differsfrom thatof industriulsimulationpractitioners.

Our approach provides a way of automatically generating a mapping from a sequential simulation model to un eflcient parallel implementation.The results of this mapping can be expressed in a form which is independent of any particular parallel simulation system or language.

In order to avoid an on-coming collision, a set of rules for velocity sampling and evaluation is proposed, which aims to choose a velocity with an expected time to collision larger than a defined threshold. In order to improve the efficiency over existing methods, the sampling procedure terminates upon finding an appropriate velocity. Moreover, the proposed motion planning system does not guarantee a collision-free movement. In case of collision, another set of rules is also defined to direct the agent to make a corresponding response. The experiment results show that the proposed method can be applied into different scenarios, while making the simulation execution efficient.", "The development of many complex simulation applications requires collaborative effort from researchers with different domain knowledge and expertise, possibly at different locations. These simulation systems often require huge computing resources and data sets, which may be geographically distributed. In order to support collaborative model development and to cater for the increasing complexity of such systems, it is necessary to harness distributed resources over the Internet. While the High Level Architecture (HLA) enables interoperability, it does not provide support for collaborative development of simulation applications, nor does it provide any mechanism for managing the resources where the simulation is being executed. The emergence of Grid technologies provide exciting new opportunities for large scale distributed simulation, enabling collaboration and the use of distributed computing resources, while also facilitating access to geographically distributed data sets.

This paper describes a new framework for visual parallel programming based on the concurrency map. Four levels of abstraction are provided in order to reduce the complexity of the construction and to allow fast exploration of different design alternatives.

In particular, based on the sensed local crowd densities at different segments, our framework is capable of generating control strategies that guide the individuals on when and where to slow down for optimal overall crowd flow in realtime, quantitatively measured by multiple objectives such as shorter travel time and less congestion along the path. The resulting Pareto-front allows selection of resilient and efficient crowd control strategies in different situations. We first chose a benchmark scenario as used in [1] to test the proposed method.

Inter-process communication for synchronisation between the LPs is one of the major factors that affect the performance of parallel agent-based road traffic simulation in a distributed memory environment. Synchronisation overhead, i.e., the number of messages and the communication data volume exchanged between LPs, is heavily dependent on the employed road network partitioning algorithm. In this paper, we propose Neighbour-Restricting Graph-Growing (NRGG), a partitioning algorithm which tries to reduce the required communication between LPs by minimising the number of neighbouring partitions.

In addition, we develop DEPART -- a dynamic route planner that takes the stochastic models of both bus travel time and waiting time into account and optimizes both the speediness and reliability of routes. Experiments on real bus data set for the entire city confirm the quality and accuracy of the routes returned by DEPART in comparison to state-of-the-practice route planners.", "Dynamic adaptation of games with the objective of catering to the individual players' level of standard is an emerging and challenging research area of artificial intelligence in digital game. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for dynamic adaptation of game scenario difficulties. The goal is to fit the performance of the player to the desired conditions set by the designer. To this end, the data on player's in-game performance and dynamic game states are utilized for making adaptation decisions. Trained artificial neural networks are used to capture the relationship between dynamic game state, player performance, adaptation decision and the resultant game difficulty. Based on the predicted difficulty, adaptation of both direction and magnitude can be performed more effectively.

Such simulation requires high computational resource which triggers the need for parallel computing. The parallelization of agent-based traffic simulations is generally performed by decomposing the simulation space into spatial subregions. The agent models contained by each subregion are executed by Logical Processes (LPs). As the simulated system evolves over the simulation time in individual LPs, synchronization among LPs is required due to data dependencies. Existing work has used global barriers for synchronization which is a type of synchronous synchronization method. However, global barriers have very low efficiency due to the waiting of processes at barriers.

Because of their autonomous nature, agents can be processed by threads concurrently on GPU, and the overall simulation can be accelerated consequently. Each agent will simultaneously carry out a sense-think-act cycle in every time step. The neighbor searching is a crucial part in the sensing stage. Detecting and accessing neighbors is a memory intensive task and often becomes the major time consumer in an agent-based simulation. Our contribution, an enhanced neighbor sharing strategy, greatly speeds up this procedure when comparing with CPU implementations. The strategy is developed from a global-memory-only implementation, and then gradually improved by efficiently utilizing the much faster shared memory.

By taking advantage of the high parallelism of GPU threads, this approach achieves greater speedup. The GPU architecture is adopted in the execution of the event-parallel approach, so as to take advantage of the parallel processing capability provided by the massively large number of GPU threads. A three-stage execution model composing of generating events, sorting events and processing events in parallel is proposed. This execution model achieves good speedup.

Alternatively, a scheduler may choose to sacrifice fairness by giving up an available slot and wait for a data-local node.

This means that the monitor should not cause a situation where a malfunctioning program will behave correctly when running under the monitoring system. We define transparency as being achieved by a monitor when the events that constitute a monitored program's execution are identical in the presence or absence of the monitor.

To gain deep understanding of human mobility in cities, it is essential to recover the travelling route from these low-sampling and noisy GPS data. In this paper, an online map matching algorithm is proposed for inferring the travelling routes from the low-sampling GPS data in real-time. Unlike the existing online map matching methods which often experience an inference delay between the observation and inference, our algorithm can produce immediate inference when a new GPS point becomes available. In addition, a rollback mechanism is provided to correct the already inferred route when some unusual conditions are detected.

The high-level architecture (HLA) has been standardized as IEEE 1516 for distributed simulation in September 2000 [1]. While HLA defines the rules, interface specification and object model template (OMT), a runtime infrastructure (RTI), such as the Defense Modelling and Simulation Office (DMSO) RTI [2], provides the actual implementation of the HLA standard. In HLA terminology, a distributed simulation application is called a federation that comprises several simulation components called federates; the RTI is a communication middleware through which federates in the same federation can communicate with each other.Traditionally, HLA-based distributed simulations are conducted using a vendor-specific RTI software and federates with different RTI versions cannot cooperate with each other. To run a distributed simulation over a WAN, the required software and hardware resource arrangements and security settings must be made before the actual simulation execution. Because of this inflexibility, it is not easy to run HLA-based distributed simulations across administrative domains. To address these inflexibility issues and\u00a0\u2026", "Many real-world networks, including online social networks and communication networks, are commonly modeled as temporal graphs. Answering earliest-arrival queries in temporal graphs is one of the most fundamental studies with numerous applications, such as information diffusion and measuring temporal closeness centrality. As graph sizes are growing rapidly, speedup of query execution time becomes even more important.In this paper, we propose a novel edge-centric parallel algorithm for solving single-source earliest-arrival problem in temporal graphs based on a new data structure named Edge-Scan-Dependency Graph (ESD-Graph). We evaluate the proposed parallel algorithm by theoretical analysis as well as by empirical experiments on real-world temporal graphs and synthetic graphs. Empirical results show that the new parallel algorithm outperforms the existing serial algorithm by up to 8.2 and 9\u00a0\u2026", "To achieve competitive advantage, companies have been driven to improve their supply chain by outsourcing their non-core business. However, this increases the external risks, such as the demand and supply risks. Companies face challenges in defining effective supply chain topology to mitigate supply chain risks. In this research, we design supply chain network topologies to mitigate the demand and supply risks. Four supply chain network topologies have been designed to represent different supply chain strategies: efficient, responsive, risk-hedging, and agile strategies. An agent-based modeling approach is proposed to evaluate the performance of the supply chain network topologies under different demand and supply risk scenarios. From the results, we can identify the effective supply chain network topology to mitigate the disruption for a particular risk scenario.", "In a distributed virtual environment (DVE), participants located in different places may observe inconsistent views of the simulated virtual world due to message delay and loss in the network. This paper investigates how to compensate for the impact of message delay and loss on consistency in the DVE. We focus on dead reckoning (DR)-based update mechanisms and measure inconsistency by the time\u2013space inconsistency (TSI) metric. We theoretically analyze the TSI of an entity and derive the condition under which the impact of message delay and loss on consistency can be fully compensated for by reducing the DR threshold. Based on the analysis, a compensatory update scheduling algorithm is proposed. Experiments using real traces of a racing car game are conducted to evaluate the compensatory algorithm.

Using the metric of Time-Space Inconsistency (TSI), which combines the spatial magnitude and temporal duration of inconsistency, we analytically derive the impact of message loss on TSI when using a DR-based update mechanism. To improve consistency against message loss, a naive update scheduling algorithm is first proposed, in which the expected spatial difference is calculated by taking message loss into account.

Typically, less than 10 decision variables (out of 1000+) are selected by subject matter experts (SMEs) based on their past experience and intuition. While this approach can significantly improve the computing efficiency of the data farming process, it limits the chance of discovering \u201csurprises\u201d and moreover, data farming may be used only to verify SMEs' assumptions. A straightforward solution is simply to evolve all Red Team parameters without any SME involvement.

Due to the Internet dynamics as well as the large-scale and distributed nature of many DVEs, it is difficult to quantify the possible improvements claimed by various DVE interactivity enhancement approaches. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework that supports evaluation of interactivity indicators, under dynamic Internet conditions. We have developed and used this framework to conduct extensive experiments on PlanetLab with many distributed client and server locations. We have collected the latency experienced by over 700 client locations distributed around the globe over a few days; and used it for evaluating performance of some recently proposed zone mapping algorithms.", "Cooperative resource sharing enables distinct organizations to form a federation of computing resources. The motivation behind cooperation is that organizations are likely to serve each other by trading unused CPU cycles given the existence of irregular usage patterns of their local resources. In this way, resource sharing would enable organizations to purchase resources at a feasible level while meeting peak computational throughput requirements. This federation results in community grid that must be managed. A functional broker is deployed to facilitate remote resource access within the community grid. A major issue is the problem of correlations in job arrivals caused by seasonal usage and/or coincident resource usage demand patterns. These correlations incur high levels of burstiness in job arrivals causing the job queue of the broker to grow to an extent such that its performance becomes severely\u00a0\u2026", "Information Service is the heart of the entire Grid software infrastructure.

In this paper, a mobile code collaboration framework (MCCF) for distributed job workflow execution over the grid is described and an algorithm to identify partners for agent communication in MCCF is presented. Previous work of mobile agent communication focuses mainly on agent location and communication. Little work has been done on communication partner identification. In MCCF, a novel subjob grouping algorithm for preprocessing the job workflow's static specification is developed. The obtained information is then used during runtime to identify partners for agent communication. The mobile agent dynamic location and communication based on this approach limits the number of agents required for communication during the dynamic job workflow execution\u00a0\u2026", "Over the past few years, cluster/distributed computing has been gaining popularity. The proliferation of the cluster/distributed computing is due to the improved performance and increased reliability of these systems.

However, one of the major shortcomings of running parallel applications on cluster/distributed computing environments is the high communication overhead incurred. To reduce the communication overhead, and thus the completion time of a parallel application, this paper describes a simple, efficient and portable Key Message (KM) approach to support parallel computing on cluster/distributed computing environments.

CO ensures that messages are delivered to the local federate according to the cause and effect relationship of the events in those messages. The middleware, which encapsulates the CO delivery algorithm, provides exactly the same interface as that defined by the HLA Interface Specification. Experimental results on applications with varying degrees of coupling show that the CO delivery algorithm incurs only a small overhead compared to the Receive Order (RO) mechanism, but achieves a significant performance improvement over the Time Stamp Order (TSO) mechanism. Thus, the CO mechanism can be used in situations where we wish to guarantee the cause and effect relationship between events and also meet the real-time requirements of the simulation. The results also show that the performance of the middleware approach is close to that of an embedded implementation.", "To enhance the widespread use of a parallel supply chain simulator, a web front-end that enables access at any time and from any location has been developed. The front-end provides the capability of model uploading, simulation runs initiation, simulation activities visualization, and simulation statistics collection. Visualizing the simulation activities requires the parallel simulator to record event traces to the file system for displaying purposes. To minimize the negative impact of the recording on the performance of parallel simulation, an event trace management algorithm, coupled with a buffering mechanism, is proposed. The approach was evaluated using six sample supply chain models. The results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of maintaining the same level of speedup when recording is performed (in the range of 2.5 to 3.0 on a 4-CPU shared memory system), as compared to runs without\u00a0\u2026", "Parallel computing using Network of Workstations (NOWs) has become very popular recently. However, the execution of parallel applications on such systems has been hampered by the high communication overhead. To reduce the communication overhead and to speedup the execution of parallel applications on NOWs, the paper proposes a Key Message approach that minimizes the cost of message passing in a parallel application by prioritizing communications in the underlying shared communication network. We first describe the queueing network model on which our approach is based, then introduce the algorithm that identifies the messages to be prioritized in a parallel application, and finally discuss the results obtained. Our preliminary analysis of the algorithm on randomly generated task graphs shows improvement over the system without using the prioritization scheme.", "Discrete event simulation appears to be a nature candidate for parallel processing, since the physical system being modeled can be usually decomposed into a number of loosely coupled physical processes (PPs) which then can be modeled by several logical processes (LPs) running on a network of processors. Each LP contains a portion of the state corresponding to the PP it models, and maintains a local clock of how far it has progressed in the simulation. Processing of an LP is driven by some changes of state in the corresponding PP, and may also induce a change of state at some other PPs. To model the interaction between PPs (ie, changes of an PP a ecting PPs somewhere else), timestamped messages are transferred between LPs. Therefore, a simulator (or referred to as the simulation network) is constructed by LPs and message-passing links.Intuitively, parallelism in the physical system seems to be automatically translated into the computational concurrency. However, this exploration of parallelism in discrete event simulation is elusive because temporal aspects of simulation cannot be easily mapped to parallel computers. To ensure the correctness of simulation, one must guarantee that all LPs obey the local causality constrains, that is, an LP must process events in nondecreasing timestamp order 9]. Since LPs are executed in parallel, their local time may advance asynchronously. Therefore, time synchronization protocols have to be exploited, which broadly fall into two paradigms: conservative (eg 2, 5, 6]) and optimistic (eg 11]). In this paper, we concentrate on the former.", "Digital Twin in Industry 4.0 utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) to collect real-life data and combine it with simulation models for product design and development. The simulation process can be executed as a workflow, consisting of tasks with precedence constraints.

In this paper, a three-step scheduling model is proposed to combine scheduling of container-based workflows and the deployment of containers on a cloud\u2013edge environment. In the first step, virtual CPU (vCPU) is allocated for each container to enable vCPU sharing among different containers. Next, two-step resource deployment is used to schedule the containers onto VM, and VM onto the physical machines in either edge or cloud environment.

Most of the existing work focuses only on how to effectively schedule computing resources to execute computing requirements of simulation workflows in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Research on the scheduling of simulation workflows in consideration of task ordering, service selection, and resource allocation altogether has not been lacking. To fill in this void, this paper proposes a cloud-based 3-stage workflow scheduling model. Before scheduling computing resources to complete task requirements, the order of the tasks is determined and the services that can meet the task requirements are selected.

During the simulation, if a machine group of the wafer fab models reaches a steady state, then the proposed approach attempts to substitute this group model with a mean-delay model (MDM) as a high abstraction level model.

The goal of this work is to develop an approach to improve the method based on historical data for AED placement. To this end, we have developed a risk-based method which generates artificial OHCAs based on a risk model.

To address this issue, we introduce the hybrid variable-length crossover to evolve the structure of agent-based models. A maritime anchorage protection scenario is examined in which the number of waypoints composing the vessel's route is subjected to evolution. The experimental results demonstrate the e ectiveness of our proposed method and suggest promising research avenues in complex agent-based model optimization.", "A large scale HLA-based simulation (federation) is composed of a large number of simulation components (federates), which may be developed by different participants and executed at different locations. These federates are subject to failures due to various reasons. What is worse, the risk of federation failure increases with the number of federates in the federation. In this paper, a fault tolerance mechanism is proposed to tolerate the crash-stop failures of federates. By exploiting the decoupled federate architecture, federate failures can be masked from the federation and recovery can take place without interrupting the executions of other federates. A basic state recovery protocol is first proposed to recover the state of the failed federate relying on the checkpoint and message logging taken before the failure. Then, an optimized protocol is further developed to accelerate the state recovery procedure.

Although multi-server architecture has good scalability, the load balance and consistency are still challenging issues. Because of server resource limitations (computation, communication etc), the consistency of the virtual world cannot be guaranteed sometimes. In this paper, we address this problem by developing scheduling polices and try to get better overall consistency with limited resources. We formulate the problem by using integer programming model and propose a centralized approximate algorithm. A distributed update strategy is also developed accordingly. Our algorithm is validated by theoretical analysis and wide range of experiments.", "Multi-cluster Grids have emerged as the most popular type of grid environments. On multi-cluster grid, resources are distributed across different networks. Hence, scheduling and dispatching jobs are difficult and inefficient due to the restrictions of network and the communication overhead. This paper presents the design and implementation of an efficient GridRPC system for the multi-cluster grid. Metascheduling mechanism is developed to distribute jobs onto different clusters of computers effectively. Further, a dynamic bundling mechanism is provided to reduce overhead of job dispatching. This mechanism bundles similar requests to form a composite request that is dispatched to a grid resource. The above mechanisms have been tested with different types of services and loads, and the results show that they help to achieve more balanced workload and reduce the overhead of job dispatching. This cuts down\u00a0\u2026", "Virtual experimentation essentially includes all studies that are performed on a computer representation of a real system.

One important goal of the technology is to optimize execution by avoiding repeated computation amongst independent scenarios. Our research is concerned with the cloning of High Level Architecture (HLA) based distributed simulations. A decoupled federate architecture is designed to support correct federate cloning at runtime. A federate may spawn clones to explore different scenarios at a decision point. To address the complexity of the overall cloning-enabled distributed simulation due to increasing scenario spawning, we have devised an efficient and precise scheme to identify and partition scenarios.

Real-time rendering for massive datasets is a computation intensive task. one solution is to distributes the rendering tasks over a set of computation units to achieve high rendering performance. This paper presents a recursive sort-first partitioning algorithm named Dynamic Pixel Bucket Partition (DPBP) for parallel rendering alone with their implementation and performance in a distributed rendering environment. This algorithm distributes rendering work loads evenly to individual rendering units to achieve fast, high quality rendering of massive data. Test results in a multi-cluster environment demonstrate the practicality of this rendering algorithm.", "This paper summarizes our work involving the successive refinements of a conservative superstep protocol. The refined protocols are known as the SST, SLS, and FET protocols. Each of the refinements improves the safetime bound, which in turn reduces the number of supersteps. In general, this helps to reduce the synchronization overhead and thus the execution time. However, a change in the number of supersteps can also introduce load imbalances within supersteps into the simulation. This observation becomes apparent with the FET protocol in particular. The performance of the refined protocols is compared through several semiconductor supply-chain simulation models. The results from the experiments strongly indicate the feasibility of using parallel discrete-event simulation techniques in the simulation of large scale systems such as a supply-chain.", "Performance prediction is useful in helping parallel programmers answer questions such as speedup scalability. Performance prediction for parallel simulation requires first working out the performance analyzer algorithms for specific simulation protocols. In order for the prediction results to be close to the results from actual parallel executions, there are further considerations when implementing the analyzer. These include (a) equivalence of code between the sequential program and parallel program, and (b) system effects (e.g. cache miss rates and synchronization overheads in an actual parallel execution).

To facilitate the portability of the constructor, a VPEcons Builder has also been developed. It is a tool for creating basic component blocks and binding an existing language to the blocks created. The usefulness of the constructor is demonstrated with a parallel discrete-event simulation example and by comparing it with other visual parallel programming tools.< >", "Monitoring is fundamental to program testing, debugging and performance analysis. It can provide both statistical data for evaluating the performance of a program and dynamic execution information for demonstrating execution states, thus presenting the overall behaviour of a program to the user. However, in monitoring distributed real-time systems, a major difficulty arises from the intrusive nature of the monitor. This paper describes an approach, based on\" Logical Clocks\", which aims to minimise the amount of interference, thus achieving a high transparency. Since the logical time of a process now plays the same role as that of real time when running without the monitor, it is possible to replace real-time constraints with logical-time constraints. In this way, the approach may be applied to the monitoring of real-time systems.", "Aim Mathematical optimization of automated external defibrillator (AED) placement has demonstrated potential to improve survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Existing models mostly aim to improve accessibility based on coverage radius and do not account for detailed impact of delayed defibrillation on survival. We aimed to predict OHCA survival based on time to defibrillation and developed an AED placement model to directly maximize the expected survival rate. Methods We stratified OHCAs occurring in Singapore (2010\u20132017) based on time to defibrillation and developed a regression model to predict the Utstein survival rate. We then developed a novel AED placement model, the maximum expected survival rate (MESR) model.

Many workflows from different users could be submitted to clouds at the same time and cloud providers should handle them simultaneously. So, it is necessary to consider the problem of scheduling multi-workflow. In addition, cloud computing systems can offer some special features, like Pay-Per-Use and Quality of Service (QoS) over the Internet. The scheduler has to consider the tradeoffs between different QoS parameters in order to satisfy the QoS requirements. Hence, how to schedule multiple heterogeneous workflows in the meanwhile to balance multiple objectives is a big challenge. The majority of the existing multi-workflow scheduling algorithms are based on QoS constrained approaches and attempt to optimize one objective while taking other QoS factors as constraints.

It consists of agents and locations. When agents visit a location at the same time, the social interactions can be established among them. Simulations over SCN have been employed to study social dynamics such as disease spread among population. Because of the scale of SCN and the execution time requirement, the simulations are usually run in parallel. However, a challenge to the parallel simulation is that the structure of SCN is naturally skewed with a few hub locations that have far more visitors than others. These hub locations can cause load imbalance and heavy communication between partitions, which therefore impact the simulation performance. This article proposes a comprehensive solution to address this challenge. First, the hub locations are decomposed into small locations, so that SCN can be divided into\u00a0\u2026", "Cloud gaming has gained significant popularity recently due to many important benefits such as removal of device constraints, instant-on and cross-platform, etc. The properties of intensive resource demands and dynamic workloads make cloud gaming appropriate to be supported by an elastic cloud platform. Facing a large user population, a fundamental problem is how to provide satisfactory cloud gaming service at modest cost. We observe that software maintenance cost could be substantial compared to server running cost in cloud gaming. In this paper, we address the server provisioning problem for cloud gaming to optimize both server running cost and software maintenance cost. We find that the distribution of game softwares among servers triggers a trade-off between the software maintenance cost and server running cost.

In the proposed framework, motions of agents are driven by a high-level heuristic (HH) which intelligently selects way-points for agents based on the current situations. Three low-level heuristics are defined and used as building blocks of the HH. Based on the newly defined building blocks and fitness evaluation function, the Self-Learning Gene Expression Programming (SL-GEP) is utilized to automatically evolve a suitable HH. To test its effectiveness, the proposed framework is applied to learn suitable HHs based on real video data. The best HH learned is then applied to generate crowd simulations and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to generate realistic crowd dynamics.", "In this paper, we study the problem of how to dispatch the play requests to the cloud servers in a cloud gaming system. We show that the dispatching strategy of play requests may heavily affect the total service cost of the cloud gaming system. The play request dispatching problem can be considered as a variant of the dynamic bin packing problem. However, we show that the classical bin packing algorithms such as First Fit and Best Fit are not efficient in dispatching the play requests in cloud gaming due to the diurnal workload pattern of online games. To address this issue, we propose an efficient request dispatching algorithm that assigns the play requests according to the predicted ending times of the game sessions. Through extensive evaluations using real online gaming traces, we show that the proposed dispatching algorithm can significantly reduce the resource waste of the cloud servers and thus decrease\u00a0\u2026", "Due to diverse network latencies, participants in a Distributed Virtual Environment (DVE) may observe different inconsistency levels of the simulated virtual world, which can seriously affect fair competition among them.

We first propose an optimized bandwidth allocation scheme for sending updates to overcome the drawbacks of uniform bandwidth allocation and the local-lag technique. Then, we integrate bandwidth allocation with an indirect relay method and develop algorithms to select relay routes for minimizing inconsistency under various bandwidth allocation schemes.

One way is to implement distributed agent-based systems using multiple partitioning mechanisms and to compare their performance. However this is in general not feasible.

However, since it has no control or visibility over the external entities, it is difficult to construct the rest of the SC model at the same level of detail. This paper proposes a hybrid model of the SC using integration design. It allows the whole SC to be captured at the broad view through system dynamics, and the target firm to be represented using agent-based model.

The servers are modeled using M/M/1 queues. In this paper, we first describe the problem, then the algorithm is presented and its bounds on the imbalance factor analyzed. The characteristics of our algorithm are also studied through simulation.

It can provide both the dynamic execution information for demonstrating execution states and the statistical data for evaluating the performance of a program. In monitoring parallel programs, a major difficulty arises from the intrusive nature of monitoring activities. Evidence of this intrusion is observable in the altered behaviour of a parallel program: a non-functioning program may begin to work when running with the monitor, and may stop working when the monitor is removed. Such intrusion is undesirable:\" transparent\" monitoring systems, which ensure that the behaviour of the monitored program is identical to that observed when running without monitoring, need to be developed.This thesis describes a new approach, called the logical clock approach, which aims to minimize the amount of intrusion in monitoring parallel programs\u00a0\u2026", "Symbiotic simulation systems that incorporate data-driven methods (such as machine/deep learning) are effective and efficient tools for just-in-time (JIT) operational decision making. With the growing interest on Digital Twin City, such systems are ideal for real-time microscopic traffic simulation. However, learning-based models are heavily biased towards the training data and could produce physically inconsistent outputs. In terms of microscopic traffic simulation, this could lead to unsafe driving behaviours causing vehicle collisions in the simulation. As for symbiotic simulation, this could severely affect the performance of real-time base simulation models resulting in inaccurate or unrealistic forecasts, which could, in turn, mislead JIT what-if analyses.

A coevolutionary fuzzy rule miner based on genetic fuzzy-system is designed to select necessary decision features from available ones and learn both rule structure and associated rule parameters from training data. The learned fuzzy rule contains multiple sub-rules, each of which can represent evacuation strategies of different individuals in a given scenario and the features in the fuzzy condition of the sub-rule are organized and evaluated in a sequential order to reflect the priorities of different features.

However, the preparedness can be challenging due to a lack of empirical data and difficulties conducting physical drills.

In a case study, we apply the model to a peak hour scenario of the ED of the largest hospital in Singapore. Two rescue strategies with different behavior sequences of medical staff as suggested by the practitioners are evaluated.

In this article, we propose an efficient and error-tolerant CVL approach (referred to as  E 2 T-CVL ) that increases localization efficiency and accuracy even in the case of large measurement errors of nearby vehicle information. Unlike the existing CVL approaches, our approach prunes the search space for the position of the target vehicle through a pruning-based strategy that considers the relative positions of nearby vehicles.

Since both model computation and simulation management are main factors that affect the performance of large-scale simulations, only accelerating model computation will limit the potential speedup. Moreover, models that can be well accelerated by a GPU could be insufficient, especially for simulations with many lightweight models. Traditionally, the parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) method is used to solve this class of simulation, but most PDES simulators only utilize the central processing unit (CPU) even though the GPU is commonly available now. Hence, we propose an alternative approach for collaborative simulation execution on a CPU+GPU hybrid system. The GPU supports both simulation management and model computation as CPUs.

In addition, lean initiatives often lead to single supplier, which is vulnerable to supply disruption. In this paper, two strategies are proposed for generating supply chain networks to improve the resilience of supply chain networks: hierarchical preferential attachment and hierarchical random attachment. The supply chain resilience is evaluated using supply availability and the demand to supply ratio. Disruptions in the supply chain are modeled using random and targeted disruptions. The paper also designed an algorithm to recover the supply chain network from disruptions, based on the network attachment rules (preferential attachment and random attachment). Through a simulation study, the recovered supply chain is shown to have better resilience compared to a single supplier supply chain network.", "A parallel and distributed simulation (federation) is composed of a number of simulation components (federates). Since the federates may be developed by different participants and executed on different platforms, they are subject to Byzantine failures. Moreover, the failure may propagate in the federation, resulting in epidemic effect. In this article, a three-phase (i.e., detection, location, and recovery) Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism is proposed based on a transparent middleware approach. The replication, checkpointing and message logging techniques are integrated in the mechanism for the purpose of enhancing simulation performance and reducing fault tolerance cost.

We utilize artificial neural networks to construct a data-driven prediction model to estimate the effect of taking certain adaptation to the game.

As Area-Of-Interest (AOI) defines each player's interests, an entity normally maintains a subscriber list of players whose AOIs cover the position of the entity. To maintain the subscriber list, players are required to send AOI updates. Unfortunately, AOI update is vulnerable to information exposure (IE) attack especially on P2P infrastructure. Sensitive information, such as player's position, can be revealed during AOI update without owner's authorization and attention. This eventually results in an unfair game. In this paper, we demonstrate that such IE attack on MMOG can help cheaters gain unauthorized benefits.

Compared to the traditional mechanisms, the hybrid mechanism reduces the upload bandwidth consumption at each player site and thus allows more players to join the virtual environment with today's network capacity.

In order to minimize the amount of intrusion in monitoring parallel programs, the logical clock approach (LCA) was proposed. It uses logical clocks to time and control the ordering of communication events during monitoring, and to reflect the real execution behavior when running without monitoring. However, the main problem with LCA is that in the case of non-deterministic communication and when several processes wait on each other's logical clock to advance, an interlock situation may occur, where none of the processes can continue to execute. This paper presents a strategy to avoid the interlock situations, based on the concept of ready condition.

Crowd-level abnormal behaviors (CABs), eg, counter flow and crowd turbulence, are proven to be the crucial causes of many crowd disasters. In the recent decade, video anomaly detection (VAD) techniques have achieved remarkable success in detecting individual-level abnormal behaviors (eg, sudden running, fighting and stealing), but research on VAD for CABs is rather limited. Unlike individual-level anomaly, CABs usually do not exhibit salient difference from the normal behaviors when observed locally, and the scale of CABs could vary from one scenario to another. In this paper, we present a systematic study to tackle the important problem of VAD for CABs with a novel crowd motion learning framework, multi-scale motion consistency network (MSMC-Net). MSMC-Net first captures the spatial and temporal crowd motion consistency information in a graph representation. Then, it simultaneously trains multiple feature graphs constructed at different scales to capture rich crowd patterns. An attention network is used to adaptively fuse the multi-scale features for better CAB detection. For the empirical study, we consider three large-scale crowd event datasets, UMN, Hajj and Love Parade. Experimental results show that MSMC-Net could substantially improve the state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.", "Complex manufacturing systems produce highly engineered products with long product cycle times and are characterized by complex production process behaviors.

For trolley-ridden patients, elevators are often the only available mode for vertical evacuations. Thus, allocation of trolley-ridden patients to elevators is important to reduce vertical evacuation time with limited number of elevators. We developed a simulation model of vertical evacuation using elevators and applied the model to the future Singapore General Hospital emergency department as a case study. In the case study, we divided trolley-ridden patients into several groups based on their locations and evaluated the maximum evacuation time for various allocation setups.

Although this allows heterogeneous devices to gain access to multiple game titles, latency issue is always unavoidable. Each game input must go through a complete round trip between the player's device and the cloud gaming server. Hence, cloud games are not as responsive as traditional computer games where the game logic runs locally. Moreover, in order to have an acceptable level of game playability, the latency level must be within a certain threshold. This also prevents some players who are located in remote regions from playing the game due to high latency. Therefore, in this paper, we employ edge servers in order to reach those players by activating lower capability RSes which are more geographically distributed.

A large number of passengers gather around the elevator entrances and may cause unexpected accidents such as stampede. An effective way to guide the flow of passengers is to use guardrails. So far, the arrangement of guardrails in most subway stations is still designed manually, which requires rich experience and expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose to use the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to design the guardrails of the elevator entrance automatically. The transfer time of passengers and the flow rate are optimized concurrently. The proposed algorithm is tested in two scenarios with different complexities.

Nevertheless, the performance of these nature-inspired stochastic search algorithms still depends on the suitability of their parameter settings with respect to specific optimization problems. The tuning of the parameters is a crucial task which concerns resolving the contrary goals of convergence and diversity. To address this issue, we propose a diversity-driven self-adaptive mechanism (SAM) for the simulated binary crossover. This novel technique exploits and optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation during the evolutionary process. This \u201cexplore first and exploit later\u201d approach is addressed through the automated and dynamic adjustment of the distribution index of the simulated binary crossover (SBX) operator.

In light of the prevalence of web services, issues relating to distributed simulation using web services have come to the fore in recent years. We have proposed a service-oriented architecture for distributed simulations on the Grid (SOAr-DSGrid). SOAr-DSGrid facilitates the development and execution of distributed simulations in different views (i.e., a component-based view for development and a service-oriented view for execution). At run time, one component may require information from another component for execution or decision-making. In SOAr-DSGrid, this shared information from one component to another component is implemented through shared variables. Since two components may execute out of phase, without proper shared variable management, the value provided by one component may be invalid for another\u00a0\u2026", "Resource contention on shared resources occurs when workload demands exceed the aggregate capacity of shared resources in the community. The token-exchange incentive scheme is traditionally employed to motivate organizations to contribute sufficiently to the community, as a means to minimize free riding. The same incentive scheme can concurrently be used to serve as a mechanism for performing admission control on jobs submitted by users. However, due to the likelihood of fluctuations in demand for computing resources, the initial assignment of tokens on the basis of each organization's resource contribution may have a significant impact on the performance trade-off between fairness and the system admission ratio. To address this problem, we extend the token-exchange scheme by designing trading policies that are responsive to the instantaneous degree of contention, so that, the trade-off between\u00a0\u2026", "Information Service is a key component of a Grid environment and crucial to the operation of a computational Grid. This paper presents an Information Service for a computational Grid Virtual Organization (VO). The main functionality of this Information Service is the provision of information essential for applications running on a computational Grid.

Many parallel programming languages and related programming models have become widely accepted on clusters. However, the high communication overhead is a major shortcoming of running parallel applications on cluster/distributed computing environments. To reduce the communication overhead and thus the completion time of a parallel application, this paper introduces and evaluates an efficient Key Message (KM) approach to support parallel computing on cluster computing environments.

We argue that the resource co-reservation model can improve the performance of resource co-reservation for parallel tasks while keeping the autonomy of resources. Based on these models, resource co-reservation heuristics are presented and their performance is analyzed.", "The need for better understanding, control and optimization of supply chains is being recognized more than ever in the new economy.

After that, a threshold-based dynamic load-balancing strategy, that makes use of the object replication, will be introduced. The paper will then focus on a performance prediction model that is used in the decision making of the dynamic load-balancing strategy. The prediction model monitors the runtime behavior of an invoked method and estimates the execution time of its subsequent invocations. It helps the dynamic load-balancing strategy to make wiser decisions on whether or not to migrate objects in order to achieve better performance. A detailed simulation system is constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed dynamic load-balancing strategy and the prediction model. Experimental results of the simulation will also be discussed in the paper.", "Image coding is imperative for successful implementation of visual communications applications.

The cost eectiveness of NOW is obvious compared to dedicated and expensive parallel computer systems. However, oneofthemajorshortcomings of the NOW-based parallel computing is the high communication overhead incurred. To reduce the high communicationoverhead, other researchers have proposed and implemented new communication systems that either rely on addition hardware support or require extensive modication of the underlying operating systems.

It is widely believed that contact interactions among individual entities play an essential role in the spreading process. Although the contact interactions are often influenced by geometrical conditions, little attention has been paid to understand their effects especially on contact duration among pedestrians. To examine how the pedestrian flow setups affect contact duration distribution, we have analyzed trajectories of pedestrians in contact interactions collected from pedestrian flow experiments of uni-, bi- and multi-directional setups. Based on standardized maximal distance, we have classified types of motions observed in the contact interactions. We have found that almost all motion in the unidirectional flow setup can be characterized as subdiffusive\u00a0\u2026", "The recent development of new technologies within the Industry 4.0 revolution drives the increased digitization of manufacturing plants. To effectively utilize the digital twins, it is essential to guarantee a correct alignment between the physical system and the associated simulation model along the whole system life cycle. Data assimilation is frequently used to incorporate observation data into a running model to produce improved estimates of state variables of interest. However, it assumes a closed system and cannot handle structural changes in the system, e.g., machine breakdown. Instead of combining the observation data into an existing model, we aim to automatically generate the model concurrently with the data assimilation procedure. This can reduce the time and cost of building the model. In addition, it can generate a more accurate model when sudden operational changes are not reflected at the higher\u00a0\u2026", "Distributed computing is one of the ways to scale up agent-based microscopic vehicle traffic simulations. A key factor for performance is the partitioning of the road network providing computation load balancing and minimizing communication cost. Many approaches use the number of agents as proxy to estimate the computational and communication costs, assuming a direct relation. However this assumption does not hold in a heterogeneous computing environment, e.g. on the cloud. This work discusses a novel proposal to improve the prediction of the computational and communication costs by using information of the simulation\u2019s run-time environment. Preliminary evidence indicates that making the partitioning performance-aware results in higher performance.", "Multi-agent pickup and delivery, a variant of the multi-agent path finding problem, aims to find collision-free paths for a set of agents performing a continuous stream of pickup and delivery tasks. Owing to the service guarantee nature of applications, these agents often need to execute the tasks within their stipulated deadlines. When failure to meet task deadlines is unavoidable, there is a need to minimise the tardiness experienced by the tasks. To address this problem, we propose a cost-based integrated task assignment and path planning algorithm to assign tasks to the agents.", "Modeling and simulation (M&S) has shown to be effective at conducting what-if analyses of complex scenarios. However, the current societal and technical challenges require building increasingly complex models and carrying out larger scale simulation experiments, which call for more efficient and intelligent approaches in all aspects of simulation studies, from model creation to model execution and experimentation.

He went on to discuss the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) and how it is driving the development of hardware and applications in the HPC sector. The trend of growing system complexity is also accelerating the development of software tools and hardware platforms specifically developed for AI/ML [1]. In his presentation, Carothers posed the following questions: Can AI/ML help M&S be more sustainable? Can M&S help improve AI/ML predictions?", "Applying simulation-based optimization to city-scale traffic signal optimization can be challenging due to the large search space resulting in high computational complexity. A divide-and-conquer approach can be used to partition the problem and optimized separately, which leads to faster convergence. However, the lack of coordination among the partial solutions may yield a poor-quality global solution. In this paper, we propose a new method for simulation-based optimization of traffic signal control, called spatially iterative coordination for parallel optimization (SICPO), to improve coordination among the partial solutions and reduce synchronization between the partitioned regions. The traffic scenario is simulated to obtain the interactions, which is used to spatially decompose the scenario into regions and identify interdependencies between the regions.

To improve the prediction accuracy, one possible way is to improve supply chain visibility by sharing information and knowledge among the supply chain entities. However, there is a potential risk that the raw data may be leaked to the competitors, affecting the business opportunities. To avoid information leakage, a secure demand forecasting with supply chain visibility is necessary. This paper proposes a Federated Learning based approach to predict demand for supplier with supply chain visibility while protecting the data privacy of other entities within the supply chain. To evaluate performance of forecasting accuracy, we designed a supply chain simulation model to generate data. From the experimental results, our proposed method outperforms the other demand forecasting methods without visibility\u00a0\u2026", "Discrete simulation is an indispensable approach to investigate systems whose complexity prohibits analytical modeling and for which real-world experimentation is costly or dangerous.

IoT sensors are simulated by generating IoT events based on a discrete-event simulation of a wafer-fab. The virtual sensors are connected through an IoT hub to enable transmission and aggregation of the sensor data. A digital twin is created by assimilating the generated sensor data and the simulation models.

Existing map matching algorithms usually infer the traveling routes based on a driving cost model that considers various traveling features and driving preferences (referred to as weights). In general, the weights are estimated either empirically or through data-driven approaches. For empirical setting, the weights are determined based on field studies and must be reestimated when the driving scenarios are changed. Alternatively, in data-driven approaches, the weights are determined from the analysis of historical routes of vehicles. However, estimation bias may be introduced due to the selection of data sources. To decrease the estimation bias, this article proposes a distribution-based weights estimation method. Specifically, the weights are estimated by inferring their distributions through\u00a0\u2026", "We study how the presence of committed volunteers influences the collective helping behavior in emergency evacuation scenarios.

Many High-Performance Domain-Specific Languages (HPDSLs) are aimed at simplifying the programming efforts by abstracting away hardware details, allowing users to program in a sequential style. However, most HPDSLs still require the users to manually map compute workloads to the best suitable hardware to achieve optimal performance. This again calls for knowledge of the underlying hardware and trial-and-error attempts. Further, very often they only consider an offloading mode where compute-intensive tasks are offloaded to accelerators. During this offloading period, CPUs remain idle, leaving parts of the available computational power untapped.

In this paper, a Bayesian-based localization approach, named as BayesNVL is proposed to estimate the absolute positions of the nearby vehicles from an ego vehicle through incorporating the GPS measurements and measured relative positions.

This approach is shown to be robust against hyperparameters. Experiments carried out with a real-life MMOG dataset show that HATDR is comparable to the state-of-the-art DR approaches.", "Interest management is a filtering technique to reduce communication in simulation. It involves a process called \"interest matching\" to identify intersections between two sets of d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangles. Because of frequent demands in simulation execution, interest matching becomes a bottleneck as the problem size grows. However, classical interest matching algorithms, mainly designed for serial processing, do not take advantage of modern multicore processors' computing power. Recent parallel interest matching algorithms can fill the gap, but there is scope for improvement. In this paper, we propose a parallel hierarchical sort-based interest matching algorithm.

It enables the provisioning and de-provisioning of resources to match dynamic resource availability and demands. In the case of distributed graph processing, changing the number of the graph partitions while maintaining high partitioning quality imposes serious computational overheads as typically a time-consuming graph partitioning algorithm needs to execute each time repartitioning is required. In this paper, we propose a dynamic scaling method that can efficiently change the number of graph partitions while keeping its quality high. Our idea is based on two techniques: preprocessing and very fast edge partitioning, called graph edge ordering and chunk-based edge partitioning, respectively. The former converts the graph data into an ordered edge list in such a way that edges with high locality are closer to each other. The latter immediately divides the ordered edge list into an arbitrary number of high-quality partitions. The evaluation with the real-world billion-scale graphs demonstrates that our proposed approach significantly reduces the repartitioning time, while the partitioning quality it achieves is on par with that of the best existing static method.", "Modeling Helping Behavior in Emergency Evacuations Page 1 Game Theoretic Modeling of \nHelping Behavior in Emergency Evacuations Jaeyoung Kwak Complexity Institute, Nanyang \nTechnological University jaeyoung.kwak@ntu.edu.sg February 5, 2021 Page 2 Background \n(1) \u2022 People often help others who are in trouble \u2022 Evacuees assist injured persons to escape \n(eg, London bombing 2005) Page 3 Background (2) \u2022 Prosocial behavior: attempt to increase \nthe benefit of others \u2022 Altruism: self-sacrifice, helping others even if it is a costly behavior to the \nhelper \u2022 potentially reduce the total evacuation time \u2013 adding \u201cadditional\u201d rescuers \u2022 Voluntary \nbehavior \u2013 without receiving benefits, even costly (extra evac. time) Page 4 Game theoretic \nmodeling \u2022 Strategic interactions among evacuees \u2022 Individuals select a strategy maximizing \nown payoff \u2022 Two types of players: \u2013 Volunteers (C): help others \u2013 Bystanders (D): not \u2026", "State fast-forwarding has been proposed as a method to reduce the computational cost of microscopic traffic simulations while retaining per-vehicle trajectories.

We explore various configurations of neural networks in light of the trade-off between accuracy and performance. Measurements in road network simulations demonstrate that cluster fast-forwarding can substantially outperform both time-driven state updates and single-vehicle fast-forwarding, while introducing only a small deviation in travel times.", "Large-scale graph-structured computation is becoming increasingly important for various data analytics applications.

A performance monitor is introduced using a middleware approach to measure the performance of individual federates transparently to the simulation application. Based on the performance measurements, a resource manager distributes the available computational resources to the federates, making them advance simulation time with comparable speeds. Our proposed approach is evaluated using a real-world simulation model with various workload inputs and different parameter settings. The experimental results show that, compared with distributing resources evenly among federates, our proposed approach can accelerate the simulation execution significantly using the same amount of computational resources.", "Interest Management (IM) aims at eliminating irrelevant state updates transmitted in Networked Virtual Environment (NVE), such as online games.

Comparing to the existing IM mechanisms, the recently proposed collaborative IM mechanism (CIM) successfully reduces the communication cost further. However, two problems exist in the current CIM mechanism: i) the protocol may fail under certain circumstances, and ii) the protocol requires dividing the virtual environment into fixed grids.

In such architecture, the large virtual world can be partitioned into multiple smaller zones, enabling load distributions or zoneto-server mappings to improve interactivity. For example, a zone might be mapped (assigned) to a server location near most of its clients to reduce network latency. In this paper, we consider the problem of live zone migration over wide area networks (WANs) to support DVE zone re-mapping or load re-distribution in a geographically distributed server infrastructure. We propose a virtualization-based zone migration approach, and develop several migration algorithms to effectively migrate multiple DVE zones.

Sporadic contention is caused by on-demand requests when organizations seek to consume large amounts of resource from each other. For this reason, admission control mechanisms need to be incorporated to prevent oversubscription of shared resources. The major constrain in admission control is that requests are handled FCFS. As such, the service-level agreement (SLA) cannot be changed by the system at the discretion of the resource manager. We characterize this problem as non-preemptive admission control.

To address this issue, we have previously proposed a consistency model to determine the update interval of entities based on their relative importance, a utility model to compute the relative importance of entities, and a flexible state update mechanism to ensure updating within these intervals and to balance the number of updates in each simulation frame. In this paper, we focus on the performance evaluation of these timely state update mechanisms. Using a battlefield benchmark, the performance is evaluated in terms of the total amount of data exchanged, the number of simulation frames skipped, and the number of go-through-accidents occurring during the simulation.

Since LPs are executed in parallel, their simulation time may advance asynchronously. Thus, an LP may not always receive messages with increasing timestamps. However, in order to correctly simulate the physical system, each LP has to process its incoming messages in their global timestamp order. In the past 20 years, there are many protocols that have been proposed to solve the above synchronization problem. In general, these parallel simulation protocols can be broadly classi ed into two groups: conservative or optimistic.In a conservative approach [1], an LP can make progress in simulation only when the causality is preserved. With this constraint, it is possible that a simulation model may have deadlocks even if the simulated physical system does not. To avoid deadlocks, conservative protocols usually rely on sending updated local simulation time of an LP to other LPs using additional protocol messages. Handling protocol message is therefore considered to be the major overhead in the conservative approach.", null, "Natural language processing (NLP) is an important research direction, since it addresses the needs of the approaching information age.

Although the workflow scheduling problem has been widely studied, only a few methods are tailored for the combination of resource provisioning and scheduling under the consideration of cloud resource constraints and multiple workflows. The cloud resource constraint is due to either the policy or system limitation on the number of cloud resources available. To complete a set of complex workflows in an acceptable makespan and affordability under resource constraints, we propose a new two-stage genetic-based optimization for multiple workflow resource provisioning and scheduling on the cloud. The first stage performs the selection of candidate cloud resources for the resource pool according to the resource constraint. The second stage selects the resources for provisioning and optimizes the scheduling of the tasks on these resources. The performance of the solution is only evaluated in the second stage based on the resource selection and schedule. Efficient encoding is used for the first stage to reduce the search space and provide more opportunities to cache the results for the second stage.

The pitfalls of rollback echoes, chasing hazards and cascading rollbacks can be identified as being attributable to the inefficiency of the conventional per-event based cancellation scheme. Instead of capturing the happen-before relation between events, which is used by the range based cancellation scheme, the batch based cancellation scheme proposed in this paper utilizes a modified paradigm of vector time, namely, state vector, to capture the dependence of events. We prove that with conformance to specific rules regulating the advancement of LPs, the events to be cancelled by a straggler message can be determined using a range of the state vector. Thus, knowledge of the range enables any LP to recover from the receipt of a straggler message at the cost of at most one rollback (ie, rollback optimal). The results of preliminary experiments conducted using a manufacturing model show that the proposed scheme is successful in reducing the number of anti-messages and increasing the ratio of the number of committed events to the number of processed events.", "A key metric in the design of interior layouts of public transport vehicles is the dwell time required to allow passengers to board and alight. Real-world experimentation using physical vehicle mock-ups and involving human participants can be performed to compare dwell times among vehicle designs. However, the associated costs limit such experiments to small numbers of trials. In this paper, we propose an agentbased simulation model of the behavior of passengers during boarding and alighting. High-level strategical behavior is modeled according to the Recognition-Primed Decision paradigm, while the low-level collisionavoidance behavior relies on an extended Social Force Model tailored to our scenario. To enable successful navigation within the confined space of the vehicle, we propose a mechanism to emulate passenger turning while avoiding complex geometric computations. We validate our model against real-world experiments from the literature, demonstrating deviations of less than 11%. In a case study, we evaluate the boarding and alighting times required by three autonomous vehicle interior layouts proposed by industrial designers.", "Maintaining interactivity is one of the key challenges in distributed virtual environments (DVE), eg, online games, distributed simulations, etc., due to the large, heterogeneous Internet latencies; and the fact that clients in a DVE are usually geographically separated.

We identify and formulate two variants of this new problem and show that they are both NP-hard via reductions to the set covering problem. We then propose several computationally efficient approximation algorithms for solving the problem. The main algorithms exploit dependencies among distributed servers to make provisioning decisions.We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. More specifically, we use both static Internet latency data available from prior measurements and topology generators, as well as the most recent, dynamic latency data collected via our own large-scale deployment of a DVE performance monitoring system over PlanetLab.

One of the problem with causal order delivery algorithms is the need to attach the dependency information with each message to ensure the causal ordering of delivery. This introduces a large amount of overhead and limits the scalability of the algorithm.

However, in multicast environment, it fails to eliminate indirect dependencies in some cases. In this paper, an improved causal order delivery algorithm that eliminates indirect dependencies in broadcast as well as multicast environment is proposed.

The candidates for this year's best paper are (in no particular order):", "We report an approach to achieve effective crowd control strategies through adaptively evolving an agentbased model of Crowd Simulation for Military Operations (COSMOS). COSMOS is a complex system simulation platform developed to address challenges posed by the Military Operations in Urban Terrains (MOUT). Modeling and simulating soldiers\u2019 tactical behaviors in MOUT scenarios is challenging due to the complex and emerging behaviors of crowds and large parameter space of the models. Consequently, it is difficult to search for effective crowd control strategies through tuning the model parameters manually. We employ an adaptive evolutionary computation approach, using the Complex Adaptive Systems Evolver (CASE), to address this challenge. Specifically, we conduct experiments using a \u201cbuilding-protection\u201d scenario, where the operation plans of soldier agents are adaptively evolved to best control a crowd. The results suggest this approach using agent-based simulation and evolutionary computation techniques is promising for the study of complex military operations.", "Message from the Chairs Page 1 Message from the Chairs We are pleased to welcome you to \nthe 18th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulations and Real Time \nApplications (DS-RT 2014), held this year in Toulouse (France).

Many parallel programming languages and related parallel programming modes are becoming widely accepted. However, the execution of parallel applications on distributed systems has been hampered by the high communication overhead.To reduce the communication overhead and the completion time of a parallel application, we propose a Key Message model for parallel computing on Network of Workstations (NOW). In the Key Message model, all messages generated in a key message path are prioritized. A Key Message path in a task graph is de ned as the critical communication in the task graph, which is automatically identi ed by the Key Message algorithm. In this paper, we rst describe a queueing system model on which our approach is based, then introduce the algorithm that identi es the key message paths to be prioritized in a parallel application. The cost of the algorithm is also analyzed, and the performance of the algorithm is studied using a simulation.", null, "Author Index Page 1 Author Index Abassi, Munir......................................................................................... \n19 Bollen, Lars.......................................................................................... 254 Adam, Dimitra...................................................................................... \n168 Bordi\u00e9s, Osmel.................................................................................... 300 Adesope, Olusola O. \n............................................................................. 99 Borges, Simone S. .............................................................................. \n181 Adnan, Muhammad................................................................................ 67 B\u00f6rner, Dirk.......................................................................................... \n644 Aedo, Ignacio....................................................................................... 640 Borotis, Spiros...................................................................................... \n227 Aggelopoulou, Nikolitsa....................................................................... 716 Boticario, Jesus G. \n.............................................................................. 529 Ahmad, Norazlina................................................................................ \n126 Bouzid, Yosra.\u2026", "This year there were 31 papers submitted to PADS and we continued the tradition of double blind reviewing.

In order for simulation to provide an effective decision support tool, it is necessary to be able to evaluate alternative scenarios quickly and effectively. Distributed simulation cloning is designed to improve the performance of \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis by enabling the examination of alternative scenarios concurrently within the same execution session. Fault tolerance is also required to support runtime robustness in HLA-based simulations. A generic approach to state saving and replication is necessary for these purposes. Nowadays, complex simulation applications may require huge computing resources and the data sets may also be geographically distributed. Such simulations may benefit from Web and Grid services in enhancing interoperability and execution flexibility. Furthermore, in order to effectively use sharable computing resources, it is desirable to introduce load balancing into large scale HLA-based distributed simulations.We propose a decoupled federate architecture in order to facilitate solutions to the above issues. A normal federate is decoupled into two processes, which execute the simulation model (virtual federate) and the Local RTI Component (physical federate) respectively. This approach interlinks the two processes together via external communication channels. The virtual federate interacts with the RTI through the standard RTI interface supported by a customized library. Benchmark experiments have been performed to study the extra overhead incurred by the decoupled federate architecture against a normal\u00a0\u2026", "The conference offers a note of thanks and lists its reviewers.", "Provides a listing of current committee members.", "Provides a listing of current committee members.", "Message from Program Chair Page 1 Message from the Program Chair A warm welcome to \nPADS 2008, the 22nd ACM/IEEE/SCS Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed \nSimulation.
