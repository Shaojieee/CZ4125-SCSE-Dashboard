employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchical representations of data, and have produced state-of-the-art results in many domains. Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the context of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we review significant deep learning related models and methods that have been employed for numerous NLP tasks and provide a walk-through of their evolution. We also summarize, compare and contrast the various models and put forward a detailed understanding of the past, present and future of deep learning in NLP.", "Understanding emotions is one of the most important aspects of personal development and growth and, as such, it is a key tile for the emulation of human intelligence. Besides being a important for the advancement of AI, emotion processing is also important for the closely related task of polarity detection. The opportunity automatically to capture the sentiments of the general public about social events, political movements, marketing campaigns, and product preferences, in fact, has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of affective computing and sentiment analysis, which leverage on human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal processing for distilling people\u2019s sentiments from the ever-growing\u00a0\u2026", "The Web holds valuable, vast, and unstructured information about public opinion. Here, the history, current use, and future of opinion mining and sentiment analysis are discussed, along with relevant techniques and tools.", "Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world. Knowledge graphs that represent structural relations between entities have become an increasingly popular research direction toward cognition and human-level intelligence. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the knowledge graph covering overall research topics about: 1) knowledge graph representation learning; 2) knowledge acquisition and completion; 3) temporal knowledge graph; and 4) knowledge-aware applications and summarize recent breakthroughs and perspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information.

NLP research has evolved from the era of punch cards and batch processing (in which the analysis of a sentence could take up to 7 minutes) to the era of Google and the likes of it (in which millions of webpages can be processed in less than a second). This review paper draws on recent developments in NLP research to look at the past, present, and future of NLP technology in a new light. Borrowing the paradigm of `jumping curves' from the field of business management and marketing prediction, this survey article reinterprets the evolution of NLP research as the intersection of three overlapping curves-namely Syntactics, Semantics, and Pragmatics Curveswhich will eventually lead NLP research to evolve into natural language understanding.", "Affective computing is an emerging interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers and practitioners from various fields, ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, to cognitive and social sciences. With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and\u00a0\u2026", "Deep learning--based models have surpassed classical machine learning--based approaches in various text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, news categorization, question answering, and natural language inference. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of more than 150 deep learning--based models for text classification developed in recent years, and we discuss their technical contributions, similarities, and strengths. We also provide a summary of more than 40 popular datasets widely used for text classification. Finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of the performance of different deep learning models on popular benchmarks, and we discuss future research directions.", "Multimodal sentiment analysis is an increasingly popular research area, which extends the conventional language-based definition of sentiment analysis to a multimodal setup where other relevant modalities accompany language. In this paper, we pose the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis as modeling intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics. We introduce a novel model, termed Tensor Fusion Network, which learns both such dynamics end-to-end. The proposed approach is tailored for the volatile nature of spoken language in online videos as well as accompanying gestures and voice. In the experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for both multimodal and unimodal sentiment analysis.", "In this paper, we present the first deep learning approach to aspect extraction in opinion mining. Aspect extraction is a subtask of sentiment analysis that consists in identifying opinion targets in opinionated text, i.e., in detecting the specific aspects of a product or service the opinion holder is either praising or complaining about. We used a 7-layer deep convolutional neural network to tag each word in opinionated sentences as either aspect or non-aspect word. We also developed a set of linguistic patterns for the same purpose and combined them with the neural network. The resulting ensemble classifier, coupled with a word-embedding model for sentiment analysis, allowed our approach to obtain significantly better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.", "Emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging task that has recently gained popularity due to its potential applications. Until now, however, a large-scale multimodal multi-party emotional conversational database containing more than two speakers per dialogue was missing. Thus, we propose the Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD), an extension and enhancement of EmotionLines. MELD contains about 13,000 utterances from 1,433 dialogues from the TV-series Friends. Each utterance is annotated with emotion and sentiment labels, and encompasses audio, visual and textual modalities. We propose several strong multimodal baselines and show the importance of contextual and multimodal information for emotion recognition in conversations. The full dataset is available for use at http:// affective-meld.github.io.", "Analyzing human multimodal language is an emerging area of research in NLP. Intrinsically this language is multimodal (heterogeneous), sequential and asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions) and acoustic (paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous coordinated sequences. From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of this form of language. In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language. Unlike previously proposed fusion techniques, DFG is highly interpretable and achieves competative performance when compared to the previous state of the art.", "Multimodal sentiment analysis is a developing area of research, which involves the identification of sentiments in videos. Current research considers utterances as independent entities, ie, ignores the interdependencies and relations among the utterances of a video. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-based model that enables utterances to capture contextual information from their surroundings in the same video, thus aiding the classification process. Our method shows 5-10% performance improvement over the state of the art and high robustness to generalizability.", "Analyzing people\u2019s opinions and sentiments towards certain aspects is an important task of natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis, which tackles the challenges of both aspect-based sentiment analysis and targeted sentiment analysis by exploiting commonsense knowledge. We augment the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a hierarchical attention mechanism consisting of a target-level attention and a sentence-level attention. Commonsense knowledge of sentiment-related concepts is incorporated into the end-to-end training of a deep neural network for sentiment classification. In order to tightly integrate the commonsense knowledge into the recurrent encoder, we propose an extension of LSTM, termed Sentic LSTM. We conduct experiments on two publicly released datasets, which show that the combination of the proposed attention architecture and Sentic LSTM can outperform state-of-the-art methods in targeted aspect sentiment tasks.", "This article presents a deep learning based method for determining the author's personality type from text: given a text, the presence or absence of the Big Five traits is detected in the author's psychological profile. For each of the five traits, the authors train a separate binary classifier, with identical architecture, based on a novel document modeling technique. Namely, the classifier is implemented as a specially designed deep convolutional neural network, with injection of the document-level Mairesse features, extracted directly from the text, into an inner layer. The first layers of the network treat each sentence of the text separately; then the sentences are aggregated into the document vector. Filtering out emotionally neutral input sentences improved the performance. This method outperformed the state of the art for all five traits, and the implementation is freely available for research purposes.", "Technology has enabled anyone with an Internet connection to easily create and share their ideas, opinions and content with millions of other people around the world. Much of the content being posted and consumed online is multimodal. With billions of phones, tablets and PCs shipping today with built-in cameras and a host of new video-equipped wearables like Google Glass on the horizon, the amount of video on the Internet will only continue to increase. It has become increasingly difficult for researchers to keep up with this deluge of multimodal content, let alone organize or make sense of it. Mining useful knowledge from video is a critical need that will grow exponentially, in pace with the global growth of content. This is particularly important in sentiment analysis, as both service and product reviews are gradually shifting from unimodal to multimodal.

Currently systems do not treat the parties in the conversation individually by adapting to the speaker of each utterance. In this paper, we describe a new method based on recurrent neural networks that keeps track of the individual party states throughout the conversation and uses this information for emotion classification. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin on two different datasets.", "SenticNet is a publicly available semantic and affective resource for concept-level sentiment analysis. Rather than using graph-mining and dimensionality-reduction techniques, SenticNet 3 makes use of\" energy flows\" to connect various parts of extended common and common-sense knowledge representations to one another. SenticNet 3 models nuanced semantics and sentics (that is, the conceptual and affective information associated with multi-word natural language expressions), representing information with a symbolic opacity of an intermediate nature between that of neural networks and typical symbolic systems.", "A huge number of videos are posted every day on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This makes the Internet an unlimited source of information. In the coming decades, coping with such information and mining useful knowledge from it will be an increasingly difficult task. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for multimodal sentiment analysis, which consists in harvesting sentiments from Web videos by demonstrating a model that uses audio, visual and textual modalities as sources of information. We used both feature- and decision-level fusion methods to merge affective information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing works in this area is carried out throughout the paper, which demonstrates the novelty of our approach. Preliminary comparative experiments with the YouTube dataset show that the proposed multimodal system achieves an accuracy\u00a0\u2026", "We present a novel way of extracting features from short texts, based on the activation values of an inner layer of a deep convolutional neural network. We use the extracted features in multimodal sentiment analysis of short video clips representing one sentence each. We use the combined feature vectors of textual, visual, and audio modalities to train a classifier based on multiple kernel learning, which is known to be good at heterogeneous data. We obtain 14% performance improvement over the state of the art and present a parallelizable decision-level data fusion method, which is much faster, though slightly less accurate.", "Multi-view sequential learning is a fundamental problem in machine learning dealing with multi-view sequences. In a multi-view sequence, there exists two forms of interactions between different views: view-specific interactions and cross-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new neural architecture for multi-view sequential learning called the Memory Fusion Network (MFN) that explicitly accounts for both interactions in a neural architecture and continuously models them through time. The first component of the MFN is called the System of LSTMs, where view-specific interactions are learned in isolation through assigning an LSTM function to each view. The cross-view interactions are then identified using a special attention mechanism called the Delta-memory Attention Network (DMAN) and summarized through time with a Multi-view Gated Memory. Through extensive experimentation, MFN is compared to various proposed approaches for multi-view sequential learning on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets. MFN outperforms all the multi-view approaches. Furthermore, MFN outperforms all current state-of-the-art models, setting new state-of-the-art results for all three multi-view datasets.", "Sentiment analysis has been a hot research topic in natural language processing and data mining fields in the last decade. Recently, deep neural network (DNN) models are being applied to sentiment analysis tasks to obtain promising results. Among various neural architectures applied for sentiment analysis, long short-term memory (LSTM) models and its variants such as gated recurrent unit (GRU) have attracted increasing attention. Although these models are capable of processing sequences of arbitrary length, using them in the feature extraction layer of a DNN makes the feature space high dimensional. Another drawback of such models is that they consider different features equally important. To address these problems, we propose an Attention-based Bidirectional CNN-RNN Deep Model (ABCDM). By utilizing two independent bidirectional LSTM and GRU layers, ABCDM will extract both past and future\u00a0\u2026", "The Web is evolving through an era where the opinions of users are getting increasingly important and valuable. The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge\u00a0\u2026", "With the recent development of deep learning, research in AI has gained new vigor and prominence. While machine learning has succeeded in revitalizing many research fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis, we are yet to witness impressive progress in natural language understanding. One of the reasons behind this unmatched expectation is that, while a bottom-up approach is feasible for pattern recognition, reasoning and understanding often require a top-down approach. In this work, we couple sub-symbolic and symbolic AI to automatically discover conceptual primitives from text and link them to commonsense concepts and named entities in a new three-level knowledge representation for sentiment analysis. In particular, we employ recurrent neural networks to infer primitives by lexical substitution and use them for grounding common and commonsense knowledge by means of multi-dimensional scaling.", "Although most works approach it as a simple categorization problem, sentiment analysis is actually a suitcase research problem that requires tackling many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The expression \u201csentiment analysis\u201d itself is a big suitcase (like many others related to affective computing, such as emotion recognition or opinion mining) that all of us use to encapsulate our jumbled idea about how our minds convey emotions and opinions through natural language. The authors address the composite nature of the problem via a three-layer structure inspired by the \u201cjumping NLP curves\u201d paradigm. In particular, they argue that there are (at least) 15 NLP problems that need to be solved to achieve human-like performance in sentiment analysis.", "Human emotions and their modelling are increasingly understood to be a crucial aspect in the development of intelligent systems. Over the past years, in fact, the adoption of psychological models of emotions has become a common trend among researchers and engineers working in the sphere of affective computing. Because of the elusive nature of emotions and the ambiguity of natural language, however, psychologists have developed many different affect models, which often are not suitable for the design of applications in fields such as affective HCI, social data mining, and sentiment analysis. To this end, we propose a novel biologically-inspired and psychologically-motivated emotion categorisation model that goes beyond mere categorical and dimensional approaches. Such model represents affective states both through labels and through four independent but concomitant affective dimensions\u00a0\u2026", "Today millions of web-users express their opinions about many topics through blogs, wikis, fora, chats and social networks. For sectors such as e-commerce and e-tourism, it is very useful to automatically analyze the huge amount of social information available on the Web, but the extremely unstructured nature of these contents makes it a difficult task. SenticNet is a publicly available resource for opinion mining built exploiting AI and Semantic Web techniques. It uses dimensionality reduction to infer the polarity of common sense concepts and hence provide a public resource for mining opinions from natural language text at a semantic, rather than just syntactic, level.", "This special issue includes eight original works that detail the further developments of ELMs in theories, applications, and hardware implementation. In \"Representational Learning with ELMs for Big Data,\" Liyanaarachchi Lekamalage Chamara Kasun, Hongming Zhou, Guang-Bin Huang, and Chi Man Vong propose using the ELM as an auto-encoder for learning feature representations using singular values.

While this kind of bottom-up learning works well for tasks such as image classification or object detection, it is not as effective when it comes to natural language processing. Communication is much more than learning a sequence of letters and words: it requires a basic understanding of the world and social norms, cultural awareness, commonsense knowledge, etc.; all things that we mostly learn in a top-down manner. In this work, we integrate top-down and bottom-up learning via an ensemble of symbolic and subsymbolic AI tools, which we apply to the interesting problem of polarity detection from text. In particular, we integrate logical reasoning within deep learning architectures to build a new version of SenticNet, a commonsense knowledge base for sentiment analysis.", "In this paper, we study an important yet largely under-explored setting of graph embedding, i.e., embedding communities instead of each individual nodes. We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community detection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good communities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node embedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together. We evaluate such a\u00a0\u2026", "An important difference between traditional AI systems and human intelligence is the human ability to harness commonsense knowledge gleaned from a lifetime of learning and experience to make informed decisions. This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically due to a lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. Commonsense knowledge also provides background information that enables humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed. Since commonsense consists of information that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task. Previous versions of SenticNet were focused on collecting this kind of knowledge for sentiment analysis but they were heavily limited by their inability to generalize. SenticNet 4 overcomes such limitations by leveraging on conceptual primitives automatically generated by means of hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction.", "Human face-to-face communication is a complex multimodal signal. We use words (language modality), gestures (vision modality) and changes in tone (acoustic modality) to convey our intentions. Humans easily process and understand face-to-face communication, however, comprehending this form of communication remains a significant challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI must understand each modality and the interactions between them that shape the communication. In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for understanding human communication called the Multi-attention Recurrent Network (MARN). The main strength of our model comes from discovering interactions between modalities through time using a neural component called the Multi-attention Block (MAB) and storing them in the hybrid memory of a recurrent component called the Long-short Term Hybrid Memory (LSTHM). We perform extensive comparisons on six publicly available datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis, speaker trait recognition and emotion recognition. MARN shows state-of-the-art results performance in all the datasets.", null, "Emotion recognition in conversations is crucial for the development of empathetic machines. Present methods mostly ignore the role of inter-speaker dependency relations while classifying emotions in conversations. In this paper, we address recognizing utterance-level emotions in dyadic conversational videos. We propose a deep neural framework, termed conversational memory network, which leverages contextual information from the conversation history. The framework takes a multimodal approach comprising audio, visual and textual features with gated recurrent units to model past utterances of each speaker into memories. Such memories are then merged using attention-based hops to capture inter-speaker dependencies. Experiments show an accuracy improvement of 3\u20134% over the state of the art.", "Sarcasm detection is a key task for many natural language processing tasks. In sentiment analysis, for example, sarcasm can flip the polarity of an \"apparently positive\" sentence and, hence, negatively affect polarity detection performance. To date, most approaches to sarcasm detection have treated the task primarily as a text categorization problem. Sarcasm, however, can be expressed in very subtle ways and requires a deeper understanding of natural language that standard text categorization techniques cannot grasp. In this work, we develop models based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network for extracting sentiment, emotion and personality features for sarcasm detection. Such features, along with the network's baseline features, allow the proposed models to outperform the state of the art on benchmark datasets. We also address the often ignored generalizability issue of classifying data that have not been seen by the models at learning phase.", "Natural language processing (NLP), or the pragmatic research perspective of computational linguistics, has become increasingly powerful due to data availability and various techniques developed in the past decade. This increasing capability makes it possible to capture sentiments more accurately and semantics in a more nuanced way. Naturally, many applications are starting to seek improvements by adopting cutting-edge NLP techniques. Financial forecasting is no exception. As a result, articles that leverage NLP techniques to predict financial markets are fast accumulating, gradually establishing the research field of natural language based financial forecasting (NLFF), or from the application perspective, stock market prediction. This review article clarifies the scope of NLFF research by ordering and structuring techniques and applications from related work.

Aspect-based opinion mining, in particular, is one of the fundamental challenges within this research field. In this work, we aim to solve the problem of aspect extraction from product reviews by proposing a novel rule-based approach that exploits common-sense knowledge and sentence dependency trees to detect both explicit and implicit aspects. Two popular review datasets were used for evaluating the system against state-of-the-art aspect extraction techniques, obtaining higher detection accuracy for both datasets.", "Building dialogue systems that can converse naturally with humans is a challenging yet intriguing problem of artificial intelligence. In open-domain human-computer conversation, where the conversational agent is expected to respond to human utterances in an interesting and engaging way, commonsense knowledge has to be integrated into the model effectively. In this paper, we investigate the impact of providing commonsense knowledge about the concepts covered in the dialogue. Our model represents the first attempt to integrating a large commonsense knowledge base into end-to-end conversational models. In the retrieval-based scenario, we propose a model to jointly take into account message content and related commonsense for selecting an appropriate response. Our experiments suggest that the knowledge-augmented models are superior to their knowledge-free counterparts.", "Web 2.0 has changed the ways people communicate, collaborate, and express their opinions and sentiments. But despite social data on the Web being perfectly suitable for human consumption, they remain hardly accessible to machines. To bridge the cognitive and affective gap between word-level natural language data and the concept-level sentiments conveyed by them, we developed SenticNet 2, a publicly available semantic and affective resource for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. SenticNet 2 is built by means of sentic computing, a new paradigm that exploits both AI and Semantic Web techniques to better recognize, interpret, and process natural language opinions. By providing the semantics and sentics (that is, the cognitive and affective information) associated with over 14,000 concepts, SenticNet 2 represents one of the most comprehensive semantic resources for the development of affect-sensitive applications in fields such as social data mining, multimodal affective HCI, and social media marketing.", "Multimodal sentiment analysis is a very actively growing field of research. A\u00a0promising area of opportunity in this field is to improve the multimodal fusion mechanism. We present a novel feature fusion strategy that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first fusing the modalities two in two and only then fusing all three modalities. On multimodal sentiment analysis of individual utterances, our strategy outperforms conventional concatenation of features by 1%, which amounts to 5% reduction in error rate. On utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis of multi-utterance video clips, for which current state-of-the-art techniques incorporate contextual information from other utterances of the same clip, our hierarchical fusion gives up to 2.4% (almost 10% error rate reduction) over currently used concatenation. The implementation of our method is publicly available in the form of open-source code.", "Emotion recognition in conversations is crucial for building empathetic machines. Present works in this domain do not explicitly consider the inter-personal influences that thrive in the emotional dynamics of dialogues. To this end, we propose Interactive COnversational memory Network (ICON), a multimodal emotion detection framework that extracts multimodal features from conversational videos and hierarchically models the self-and inter-speaker emotional influences into global memories. Such memories generate contextual summaries which aid in predicting the emotional orientation of utterance-videos.

The amount of research work on sentiment analysis is growing explosively. However, the majority of research efforts are devoted to English-language data, while a great share of information is available in other languages. We present a state-of-the-art review on multilingual sentiment analysis. More importantly, we compare our own implementation of existing approaches on common data. Precision observed in our experiments is typically lower than the one reported by the original authors, which we attribute to the lack of detail in the original presentation of those approaches.

In reality, sentiment analysis is a \u201csuitcase problem\u201d that requires tackling many natural language processing (NLP) subtasks, including microtext analysis, sarcasm detection, anaphora resolution, subjectivity detection, and aspect extraction. In this book, we propose an overview of the main issues and challenges associated with current sentiment analysis research and provide some insights on practical tools and techniques that can be exploited to both advance the state of the art in all sentiment analysis subtasks and explore new areas in the same context.

Multi-label text categorization is finer-grained approach to text categorization which consists of assigning multiple target labels to documents. It is more challenging compared to the task of multi-class text categorization due to the exponential growth of label combinations. Existing approaches to multi-label text categorization fall short to extract local semantic information and to model label correlations. In this paper, we propose an ensemble application of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture both the global and the local textual semantics and to model high-order label correlations while having a tractable computational complexity. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance when the CNN-RNN model is trained using a large-sized dataset.", "Recently, the automatic prediction of personality traits has received a lot of attention. Specifically, personality trait prediction from multimodal data has emerged as a hot topic within the field of affective computing. In this paper, we review significant machine learning models which have been employed for personality detection, with an emphasis on deep learning-based methods. This review paper provides an overview of the most popular approaches to automated personality detection, various computational datasets, its industrial applications, and state-of-the-art machine learning models for personality detection with specific focus on multimodal approaches. Personality detection is a very broad and diverse topic: this survey only focuses on computational approaches and leaves out psychological studies on personality detection.", "Sentiment analysis has emerged as one of the most popular natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. A classic setting of the task mainly involves classifying the overall sentiment polarity of the inputs. However, it is based on the assumption that the sentiment expressed in a sentence is unified and consistent, which does not hold in the reality. As a fine-grained alternative of the task, analyzing the sentiment towards a specific target and aspect has drawn much attention from the community for its more practical assumption that sentiment is dependent on a particular set of aspects and entities. Recently, deep neural models have achieved great successes on sentiment analysis.

For this reason, one of the most important subtasks of sentiment analysis is subjectivity detection, i.e., the removal of \u2018factual\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 comments that lack sentiment. It is possibly the most essential subtask of sentiment analysis as sentiment classifiers are often optimized to categorize text as either negative or positive and, hence, forcefully fit unopinionated sentences into one of these two categories. This article reviews hand-crafted and automatic models for subjectivity detection in the literature. It highlights the key assumptions these models make, the results they obtain, and the issues that still need to be explored to further our understanding of subjective sentences. Lastly, the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The methods can be broadly categorized as\u00a0\u2026", "An increasingly large amount of multimodal content is posted on social media websites such as YouTube and Facebook everyday. In order to cope with the growth of such so much multimodal data, there is an urgent need to develop an intelligent multi-modal analysis framework that can effectively extract information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal information extraction agent, which infers and aggregates the semantic and affective information associated with user-generated multimodal data in contexts such as e-learning, e-health, automatic video content tagging and human\u2013computer interaction. In particular, the developed intelligent agent adopts an ensemble feature extraction approach by exploiting the joint use of tri-modal (text, audio and video) features to enhance the multimodal information extraction process.

Recently, graph neural models over the dependency tree are widely applied for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Most existing works, however, they generally focus on learning the dependency information from contextual words to aspect words based on the dependency tree of the sentence, which lacks the exploitation of contextual affective knowledge with regard to the specific aspect. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based on SenticNet to leverage the affective dependencies of the sentence according to the specific aspect, called Sentic GCN. To be specific, we explore a novel solution to construct the graph neural networks via integrating the affective knowledge from SenticNet to enhance the dependency graphs of sentences. Based on it\u00a0\u2026", "Stock market prediction is one of the most challenging problems which has been distressing both researchers and financial analysts for more than half a century. To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and\u00a0\u2026", "Domain adaptation problems often arise often in the field of sentiment classification. Here, the feature ensemble plus sample selection (SS-FE) approach is proposed, which takes labeling and instance adaptation into account. A feature ensemble (FE) model is first proposed to learn a new labeling function in a feature reweighting manner. Furthermore, a PCA-based sample selection (PCA-SS) method is proposed as an aid to FE. Experimental results show that the proposed SS-FE approach could gain significant improvements, compared to FE or PCA-SS, because of its comprehensive consideration of both labeling adaptation and instance adaptation.", "Predicting the affective valence of unknown multi-word expressions is key for concept-level sentiment analysis. AffectiveSpace 2 is a vector space model, built by means of random projection, that allows for reasoning by analogy on natural language con-cepts. By reducing the dimensionality of affec-tive common-sense knowledge, the model allows semantic features associated with concepts to be generalized and, hence, allows concepts to be intu-itively clustered according to their semantic and affective relatedness. Such an affective intuition (so called because it does not rely on explicit fea-tures, but rather on implicit analogies) enables the inference of emotions and polarity conveyed by multi-word expressions, thus achieving efficient concept-level sentiment analysis.", "Emotions and sentiments are subjective in nature. They differ on a case-to-case basis. However, predicting only the emotion and sentiment does not always convey complete information. The degree or level of emotions and sentiments often plays a crucial role in understanding the exact feeling within a single class (e.g., `good' versus `awesome'). In this paper, we propose a stacked ensemble method for predicting the degree of intensity for emotion and sentiment by combining the outputs obtained from several deep learning and classical feature-based models using a multi-layer perceptron network. We develop three deep learning models based on convolutional neural network, long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit and one classical supervised model based on support vector regression. We evaluate our proposed technique for two problems, i.e., emotion analysis in the generic domain and sentiment\u00a0\u2026", "In an era of social media and connectivity, web users are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and working together through online collaborative media. More recently, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas, with a growing impact on everyday life, such as in education, health, commerce and tourism, leading to an exponential growth in the size of the social Web. However, the distillation of knowledge from such unstructured Big data is, an extremely challenging task. Consequently, the semantic and multimodal contents of the Web in this present day are, whilst being well suited for human use, still barely accessible to machines. In this work, we explore the potential of a novel semi-supervised learning model based on the combined use of random projection scaling as part of a vector space model, and support vector machines to perform reasoning on a knowledge base\u00a0\u2026", "The advent of the Social Web has enabled anyone with an Internet connection to easily create and share their ideas, opinions and content with millions of other people around the world. In pace with a global deluge of videos from billions of computers, smartphones, tablets, university projectors and security cameras, the amount of multimodal content on the Web has been growing exponentially, and with that comes the need for decoding such information into useful knowledge. In this paper, a multimodal affective data analysis framework is proposed to extract user opinion and emotions from video content. In particular, multiple kernel learning is used to combine visual, audio and textual modalities. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art model in multimodal sentiment analysis research with a margin of 10\u201313% and 3\u20135% accuracy on polarity detection and emotion recognition, respectively.

Nevertheless, most literature considers them as two separate tasks. We argue that knowledge in sarcasm detection can also be beneficial to sentiment classification and vice versa. We show that these two tasks are correlated, and present a multitask learning-based framework using a deep neural network that models this correlation to improve the performance of both tasks in a multitask learning setting. Our method outperforms the state of the art by 3\u20134% in the benchmark dataset.", "In a world in which millions of people express their opinions about commercial products in blogs, wikis, fora, chats and social networks, the distillation of knowledge from this huge amount of unstructured information can be a key factor for marketers who want to create an image or identity in the minds of their customers for their product, brand or organization. Opinion mining for product positioning, in fact, is getting a more and more popular research field but the extraction of useful information from social media is not a simple task. In this work we merge AI and Semantic Web techniques to extract, encode and represent this unstructured information. In particular, we use Sentic Computing, a multi-disciplinary approach to opinion mining and sentiment analysis, to semantically and affectively analyze text and encode results in a semantic aware format according to different web ontologies.

When used as a component in the processing pipeline of other NLP fields like machine translation, sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and summarization, coreference resolution has a potential to highly improve accuracy. A direction of research closely related to coreference resolution is anaphora resolution. Existing literature is often ambiguous in its usage of these terms and often uses them interchangeably. Through this review article, we clarify the scope of these two tasks. We also carry out a detailed analysis of the datasets, evaluation metrics and research methods that have been adopted to tackle these NLP problems. This survey is motivated by the aim of providing readers with a clear understanding of what constitutes these two tasks in\u00a0\u2026", "Emotions play a key role in natural language understanding and sensemaking. Pure machine learning usually fails to recognize and interpret emotions in text accurately. The need for knowledge bases that give access to semantics and sentics (the conceptual and affective information) associated with natural language is growing exponentially in the context of big social data analysis. To this end, this paper proposes EmoSenticSpace, a new framework for affective common-sense reasoning that extends WordNet-Affect and SenticNet by providing both emotion labels and polarity scores for a large set of natural language concepts. The framework is built by means of fuzzy c-means clustering and support-vector-machine classification, and takes into account a number of similarity measures, including point-wise mutual information and emotional affinity. EmoSenticSpace was tested on three emotion-related natural\u00a0\u2026", "Sentiment analysis in conversations has gained increasing attention in recent years for the growing amount of applications it can serve, e.g., sentiment analysis, recommender systems, and human-robot interaction. The main difference between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment analysis is the existence of context information that may influence the sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual information in dialogues, however, remains a challenge. Existing approaches employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper, we propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis.

One of the reasons for this rise is that this application domain offers a particularly fertile place to test and develop the most advanced computational techniques to extract valuable information from the Web. The main contribution of this work is three-fold: (1) we provide an up-to-date literature review of the state of the art on social network analysis (SNA); (2) we propose a set of new metrics based on four essential features (or dimensions) in SNA; (3) finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of a set of popular SNA tools and frameworks.

However, a sarcastic sentence can be expressed with contextual presumptions, background and commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose CASCADE (a ContextuAl SarCasm DEtector) that adopts a hybrid approach of both content and context-driven modeling for sarcasm detection in online social media discussions. For the latter, CASCADE aims at extracting contextual information from the discourse of a discussion thread. Also, since the sarcastic nature and form of expression can vary from person to person, CASCADE utilizes user embeddings that encode stylometric and personality features of the users. When used along with content-based feature extractors such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we see a significant boost in the classification performance on a large Reddit corpus.", "The ability to analyse online user-generated content related to sentiments (e.g., thoughts and opinions) on products or policies has become a de-facto skillset for many companies and organisations. Besides the challenge of understanding formal textual content, it is also necessary to take into consideration the informal and mixed linguistic nature of online social media languages, which are often coupled with localised slang as a way to express \u2018true\u2019 feelings. Due to the multilingual nature of social media data, analysis based on a single official language may carry the risk of not capturing the overall sentiment of online content. While efforts have been made to understand multilingual sentiment analysis based on a range of informal languages, no significant electronic resource has been built for these localised languages.

Several types of factors can drive reviews' helpfulness. This study focuses on uninvestigated factors by looking at not just the quantitative factors (such as the number of concepts), but also qualitative aspects of reviewers (including review types such as the regular, comparative and suggestive reviews and reviewer helpfulness) and builds a conceptual model for helpfulness prediction. The set of 1500 reviews were randomly collected from TripAdvisor.com across multiple hotels for analysis. A set of four hypotheses were used to test the proposed model. Our results suggest that the number of concepts contained in a review, the average number of concepts per sentence, and the review type contribute to the perceived helpfulness of online reviews. The regular reviews were not statistically significant predictors of helpfulness. As a result, review\u00a0\u2026", "Multimodal sentiment analysis involves identifying sentiment in videos and is a developing field of research. Unlike current works, which model utterances individually, we propose a recurrent model that is able to capture contextual information among utterances.

Our model shows 6-8% improvement over the state of the art on a benchmark dataset.", "We compile baselines, along with dataset split, for multimodal sentiment analysis. In this paper, we explore three different deep-learning-based architectures for multimodal sentiment classification, each improving upon the previous. Further, we evaluate these architectures with multiple datasets with fixed train/test partition. We also discuss some major issues, frequently ignored in multimodal sentiment analysis research, e.g., the role of speaker-exclusive models, the importance of different modalities, and generalizability. This framework illustrates the different facets of analysis to be considered while performing multimodal sentiment analysis and, hence, serves as a new benchmark for future research in this emerging field.", "In recent years, AI research has demonstrated enormous potential for the benefit of humanity and society. While often better than its human counterparts in classification and pattern recognition tasks, however, AI still struggles with complex tasks that require commonsense reasoning such as natural language understanding. In this context, the key limitations of current AI models are: dependency, reproducibility, trustworthiness, interpretability, and explainability. In this work, we propose a commonsense-based neurosymbolic framework that aims to overcome these issues in the context of sentiment analysis. In particular, we employ unsupervised and reproducible subsymbolic techniques such as auto-regressive language models and kernel methods to build trustworthy symbolic representations that convert natural language to a sort of protolanguage and, hence, extract polarity from text in a completely interpretable and explainable manner.", "Research on sentiment analysis in English language has undergone major developments in recent years. Chinese sentiment analysis research, however, has not evolved significantly despite the exponential growth of Chinese e-business and e-markets. This review paper aims to study past, present, and future of Chinese sentiment analysis from both monolingual and multilingual perspectives. The constructions of sentiment corpora and lexica are first introduced and summarized. Following, a survey of monolingual sentiment classification in Chinese via three different classification frameworks is conducted. Finally, sentiment classification based on the multilingual approach is introduced. After an overview of the literature, we propose that a more human-like (cognitive) representation of Chinese concepts and their inter-connections could overcome the scarceness of available resources and, hence, improve\u00a0\u2026", "The advent of the Social Web has provided netizens with new tools for creating and sharing, in a time- and cost-efficient way, their contents, ideas, and opinions with virtually the millions of people connected to the World Wide Web. This huge amount of information, however, is mainly unstructured as specifically produced for human consumption and, hence, it is not directly machine-processable. In order to enable a more efficient passage from unstructured information to structured data, aspect-based opinion mining models the relations between opinion targets contained in a document and the polarity values associated with these. Because aspects are often implicit, however, spotting them and calculating their respective polarity is an extremely difficult task, which is closer to natural language understanding rather than natural language processing.

In this paper, we propose a three-stage cascade model to address the polarity shift problem in the context of document-level sentiment classification. We first split each document into a set of subsentences and build a hybrid model that employs rules and statistical methods to detect explicit and implicit polarity shifts, respectively. Secondly, we propose a polarity shift elimination method, to remove polarity shift in negations. Finally, we train base classifiers on training subsets divided by different types of polarity shifts, and use a weighted combination of the component classifiers for sentiment classification. The results on a range of experiments illustrate that our approach significantly outperforms several alternative methods for polarity shift detection and elimination.", "Subjectivity detection is a task of natural language processing that aims to remove \u2018factual\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 content, i.e., objective text that does not contain any opinion, from online product reviews.

In this paper, we extend the extreme learning machine (ELM) paradigm to a novel framework that exploits the features of both Bayesian networks and fuzzy recurrent neural networks to perform subjectivity detection. In particular, Bayesian networks are used to build a network of connections among the hidden neurons of the conventional ELM configuration in order to capture dependencies in high-dimensional data.

This article is the first survey that comprehensively introduces and discusses the methods from these categories. Domain-specific applications of SID are reviewed according to their data sources, i.e., questionnaires, electronic health records, suicide notes, and online user content.

AffectiveSpace is a vector space of affective commonsense available for English text but not for other languages nor other modalities such as electrocardiogram signals. We overcome this limitation by using deep learning to extract features from each modality and then projecting them to a common AffectiveSpace that has been clustered into different emotions. Because, in the real world, individuals tend to have partial or mixed sentiments about an opinion target, we use a fuzzy logic classifier to predict the degree of a particular emotion in AffectiveSpace.

The sentiment orientations of the extracted CSDs are identified using a support vector machine (SVM). Then, considering the existence of complex relationships among different CSDs and the customer satisfaction, an ensemble neural network based model (ENNM) is proposed to measure the effects of customer sentiments toward different CSDs on customer satisfaction.

In this paper, we introduce: 1) an agreement score to evaluate the performance of routing processes at instance level; 2) an adaptive optimizer to enhance the reliability of routing; 3) capsule compression and partial routing to improve the scalability of capsule networks. We validate our approach on two NLP tasks, namely: multi-label text classification and question answering. Experimental results show that our approach considerably improves over strong competitors on both tasks.

In addition, we adapt a zero-shot learning framework that can predict both seen and previously unseen entity types. We perform evaluation on three benchmark datasets with two settings: 1) few-shots recognition where all types are covered by the training set; and 2) zero-shot recognition where fine-grained types are assumed absent from training set.

Many opinion keywords carry varying polarities in different contexts, posing huge challenges for sentiment analysis research. Previous work on contextual polarity disambiguation makes use of term-level context, such as words and patterns, and resolves the polarity with a range of rule-based, statistics-based or machine learning methods. The major shortcoming of these methods lies in that the term-level features sometimes are ineffective in resolving the polarity. In this work, opinion-level context is explored, in which intra-opinion features and inter-opinion features are finely defined. To enable effective use of opinion-level features, the Bayesian model is adopted to resolve the polarity in a probabilistic manner.

One of the main hurdles to overcome is that computers lack both the common and common-sense knowledge that humans normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. To really understand natural language, a machine should be able to comprehend this type of knowledge, rather than merely relying on the valence of keywords and word co-occurrence frequencies. In this article, the largest existing taxonomy of common knowledge is blended with a natural-language-based semantic network of common-sense knowledge. Multidimensional scaling is applied on the resulting knowledge base for open-domain opinion mining and sentiment analysis.", "Recent developments in the field of AI have fostered multidisciplinary research in various disciplines, including computer science, linguistics, and psychology.

While traditional classification tasks and standard phenomena in computer science are easy to define, however, emotions are still a rather mysterious subject of study. That is why so many different emotion classifications have been proposed in the literature and there is still no common agreement on a universal emotion categorization model.

In this paper, we combine reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks to build a new model, termed category sentence generative adversarial network (CS-GAN). Not only the proposed model is able to generate category sentences that enlarge the original dataset, but also it helps improve its generalization capability during supervised training.

Previously, the task was modeled as a sentence-level sentiment classification problem that treated aspect targets as a hint. Such approaches oversimplify the problem by averaging word embeddings when the aspect target is a multi-word sequence. In this paper, we formalize the problem from a different perspective, i.e., that sentiment at aspect target level should be the main focus. Due to the fact that written Chinese is very rich and complex, Chinese aspect targets can be studied at three different levels of granularity: radical, character and word. Thus, we propose to explicitly model the aspect target and conduct sentiment classification directly at the aspect target level via three granularities. Moreover, we study two fusion methods for such granularities in the task of Chinese aspect-level sentiment analysis\u00a0\u2026", "Dialogue systems are a popular natural language processing (NLP) task as it is promising in real-life applications.

In this survey, we mainly focus on the deep learning based dialogue systems. We comprehensively review state-of-the-art research outcomes in dialogue systems and analyze them from two angles: model type and system type. Specifically, from the angle of model type, we discuss the principles, characteristics, and applications of different models that are widely used in dialogue systems.

We report a work on automatically merging these two resources by assigning emotion labels to more than 2700 concepts.", "This paper describes a Twitter sentiment analysis system that classifies a tweet as positive or negative based on its overall tweet-level polarity. Supervised learning classifiers often misclassify tweets containing conjunctions such as \u201cbut\u201d and conditionals such as \u201cif\u201d, due to their special linguistic characteristics. These classifiers also assign a decision score very close to the decision boundary for a large number tweets, which suggests that they are simply unsure instead of being completely wrong about these tweets.

It serves as an important role in natural language processing. User generated content, like tourism reviews, developed dramatically during the past years, generating a large amount of unstructured data from which it is hard to obtain useful information. Due to the changes in textual order, sequence length and complicated logic, it is still a challenging task to predict the exact sentiment polarities of the user reviews, especially for fine-grained sentiment classification. In this paper, we first propose sentiment padding, a novel padding method compared with zero padding, making the input data sample of a consistent size and improving the\u00a0\u2026", "The ways people express their opinions and sentiments have radically changed in the past few years thanks to the advent of social networks, web communities, blogs, wikis, and other online collaborative media. The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for marketers who want to create an image or identity in the minds of their customers for their product or brand. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions, in fact, involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient\u00a0\u2026", "Next-generation patients are far from being peripheral to health-care. They are central to understanding the effectiveness and efficiency of services and how they can be improved. Today a lot of patients are used to reviewing local health services on-line but this social information is just stored in natural language text and it is not machine-accessible and machine-processable. To distil knowledge from this extremely unstructured information we use Sentic Computing, a new opinion mining and sentiment analysis paradigm which exploits AI and Semantic Web techniques to better recognize, interpret and process opinions and sentiments in natural language text. In particular, we use a language visualization and analysis system, a novel emotion categorization model, a resource for opinion mining based on a web ontology and novel techniques for finding and defining topic dependent concepts, namely spectral\u00a0\u2026", "As the Web rapidly evolves, Web users too are evolving with it. In an era of social connectedness, people are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and collaborating through social networks, online communities, blogs, Wikis, and other online collaborative media. In recent years, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas, with particular focus on fields related to everyday life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health, causing the size of the social Web to expand exponentially. The distillation of knowledge from such a large amount of unstructured information, however, is an extremely difficult task, as the contents of today\u2019s Web are perfectly suitable for human consumption, but remain hardly accessible to machines. Big social data analysis grows out of this need and it includes disciplines such as social network analysis, multimedia management, social media analytics, trend discovery, and opinion mining. The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public about social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences, in particular, has raised growing interest both within the scientific community, leading to many exciting open challenges, as well as in the business world, due to the remarkable benefits to be had from marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deal with information retrieval and knowledge discovery from text using data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to distill knowledge and opinions from the huge amount of\u00a0\u2026", "The recent success of media-sharing services caused an exponential growth of community-contributed multimedia data on the Web and hence a consistent shift of the flow of information from traditional communication channels to social media ones. Retrieving relevant information from this kind of data is getting more and more difficult, not only for their volume, but also for the different nature and formats of their contents. In this work, we introduce Sentic Web, a new paradigm for the management of social media affective information, which exploits AI and Semantic Web techniques to extract, encode, and represent opinions and sentiments over the Web. In particular, the computational layer consists in an intelligent engine for the inference of emotions from text, the representation layer is developed on the base of specific domain ontologies, and the application layer is based on the faceted browsing paradigm\u00a0\u2026", "As the gap between human and machine shrinks, it becomes increasingly important to develop computer systems that incorporate or enhance existing Situation Awareness. However, these tend to focus on raw quantitative parameters, such as position and speed of objects. When these situations are governed by human actors, such parameters leave significant margins of uncertainty. In this paper, we discuss the potential of applying the characteristics intrinsic to the human actors that comprise a given situation to Situation Awareness, and the capacity that these concepts have to improve situation-aware systems. We argue that intention-aware based systems offer an advantage over situation-aware based systems in that they reduce the informational burden on humans without limiting effectiveness. We argue that computational analysis and tracking of semantic and affective information associated with human actors' intentions are an effective way to minimize miscommunication and uncertainty, particularly in time-sensitive and information-saturated situations.", "Sentiment analysis consists in the identification of the sentiment polarity associated with a target object, such as a book, a movie or a phone. Sentiments reflect feelings and attitudes, while emotions provide a finer characterization of the sentiments involved. With the huge number of comments generated daily on the Internet, besides sentiment analysis, emotion identification has drawn keen interest from different researchers, businessmen and politicians for polling public opinions and attitudes. This paper reviews and discusses existing emotion categorization models for emotion analysis and proposes methods that enhance existing emotion research. We carried out emotion analysis by inviting experts from different research areas to produce comprehensive results. Moreover, a computational emotion sensing model is proposed, and future improvements are discussed in this paper.", "Barriers to use health related quality of life measuring systems include the time needed to complete the forms and the need for staff to be trained to understand the results. An ideal system of health assessment needs to be clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low burden, low cost, involving for the patient and built into standard procedures. A new generation of short and easy-to-use tools to monitor patient outcomes on a regular basis has been recently proposed. These tools are quick, effective and easy to understand, as they are very structured and rigid. Such structuredness, however, leaves no space to those patients who would like to say something more. Patients, in fact, are usually willing to express their opinions and feelings in free text, rather than simply filling in a questionnaire, for either speaking out their satisfaction or for cathartic complaining.

Learning long time delays in deep belief networks is difficult due to the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients with increase in delay. To mitigate this problem and improve the transparency of learning time-delays, we introduce the use of Gaussian networks with time-delays to initialize the weights of each hidden neuron. From our knowledge of time delays, it is possible to learn the long delays from short delays in a hierarchical manner. In contrast to previous works, here dynamic Gaussian Bayesian networks over training samples are evolved using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to determine the initial weights of each hidden layer of neurons. In this way, the time-delayed network motifs of increasing Markov order across layers can be modeled hierarchically using a deep model.

Dealing with the increasing amount of information present on the Web is a critical task and requires efficient models developed by the emerging field of sentiment analysis. To this end, current research proposes an efficient approach to support emotion recognition and polarity detection in natural language text. In this paper, we show how to exploit the most recent technological tools and advances in Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) in order to efficiently build an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and assess the resultant model's performance when applied to big social data analysis. ELM represents a powerful learning tool, developed to overcome some issues in back-propagation networks.

Solutions to these problems, however, demand robust knowledge bases capable of supporting flexible, nuanced reasoning. Populating such knowledge bases is highly time-consuming, making it necessary to develop techniques for deconstructing natural language texts into commonsense concepts. In this work, we propose an approach for effective multi-word commonsense expression extraction from unrestricted English text, in addition to a semantic similarity detection technique allowing additional matches to be found for specific concepts not already present in knowledge bases.", "Automatic deception detection is an important task that has gained momentum in computational linguistics due to its potential applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet tough to beat multimodal neural model for deception detection. By combining features from different modalities such as video, audio, and text along with Micro-Expression features, we show that detecting deception in real life videos can be more accurate. Experimental results on a dataset of real-life deception videos show that our model outperforms existing techniques for deception detection with an accuracy of 96.14% and ROC-AUC of 0.9799.", "What is Common Sense Computing? And why is it so important for the technological evolution of humankind? This paper presents an overview of past, present and future efforts of the AI community to give computers the capacity for Common Sense reasoning, from Minsky\u2019s Society of Mind to Media Laboratory\u2019s Digital Intuition theory, and beyond. Is it actually possible to build a machine with Common Sense or is it just an utopia? This is the question this paper is trying to answer.", "Sentiment lexicons are essential tools for polarity classification and opinion mining. In contrast to machine learning methods that only leverage text features or raw text for sentiment analysis, methods that use sentiment lexicons embrace higher interpretability. Although a number of domain-specific sentiment lexicons are made available, it is impractical to build an ex ante lexicon that fully reflects the characteristics of the language usage in endless domains. In this article, we propose a novel approach to simultaneously train a vanilla sentiment classifier and adapt word polarities to the target domain. Specifically, we sequentially track the wrongly predicted sentences and use them as the supervision instead of addressing the gold standard as a whole to emulate the life-long cognitive process of lexicon learning. An exploration-exploitation mechanism is designed to trade off between searching for new sentiment words\u00a0\u2026", "Hitherto, sentiment analysis has been mainly based on algorithms relying on the textual representation of online reviews and microblogging posts. Such algorithms are very good at retrieving texts, splitting them into parts, checking the spelling, and counting their words. But when it comes to interpreting sentences and extracting opinionated information, their capabilities are known to be very limited. Current approaches to sentiment analysis are mainly based on supervised techniques relying on manually labeled samples, such as movie or product reviews, where the overall positive or negative attitude was explicitly indicated. However, opinions do not occur only at document-level, nor they are limited to a single valence or target. Contrary or complementary attitudes toward the same topic or multiple topics can be present across the span of a review. In order to overcome this and many other issues related to\u00a0\u2026", "Recently, interest in sentiment analysis has grown exponentially. Many studies have developed a wide variety of algorithms capable of classifying texts according to the sentiment conveyed in them. Such sentiment is usually expressed as positive, neutral or negative. However, neutral reviews are often ignored in many sentiment analysis problems because of their ambiguity and lack of information. In this paper, we propose to empower neutrality by characterizing the boundary between positive and negative reviews, with the goal of improving the model\u2019s performance. We apply different sentiment analysis methods to different corpora extracting their sentiment and, hence, detecting neutral reviews by consensus to filter them, i.e., taking into account different models based on weighted aggregation.

The method represents each short text as two dense vectors: the former is built using the word-to-word similarity based on pre-trained word vectors, the latter is built using the word-to-word similarity based on external sources of knowledge. We also developed a preprocessing algorithm that chains coreferential named entities together and performs word segmentation to preserve the meaning of phrasal verbs and idioms. We evaluated the proposed method on three popular datasets, namely Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, STS2015 and P4PIN, and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three without using prior knowledge of natural language, e.g., part-of-speech tags or parse tree, which indicates the interdependent representations of short text pairs are effective and\u00a0\u2026", "The capability of interpreting the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language through different modalities is a key issue for the enhancement of human-agent interaction.

In this work, in particular, sentic blending is interfaced with a facial emotional classifier and an opinion mining engine.

Many financial information vendors also provide it as a service. However, utilizing market sentiment under the asset allocation framework has been rarely discussed. In this article, we investigate the role of market sentiment in an asset allocation problem. We propose to compute sentiment time series from social media with the help of sentiment analysis and text mining techniques. A novel neural network design, built upon an ensemble of evolving clustering and long short-term memory, is used to formalize sentiment information into market views.

An example of this is trolling ie the exploitation of the anonymity of the Web to post inflammatory and outrageous messages directed to one specific person or community to provoke them into a desired emotional response. Online community masters usually warn users against trolls with messages such as DNFTT (Do Not Feed The Trolls) but so far this has not been enough to stop trolls trolling.

To fully extract the relative context from video clips, most studies build their models on the entire dialogues which make them lack of real-time ERC ability.

In ERLDK, the reinforcement learning algorithm is introduced to conduct real-time ERC with the occurrence of conversations. The collection of history utterances is composed as an emotion-pair which represents the multimodal context of the following utterance to be recognized.

To this end, we use SenticNet to extract natural language concepts and fine-tune several feature types on a subset of MuSe-CAR. With these features, we explore the content of a video as well as learning to predict emotional valence, arousal, and speaker topic classes.

However, there are no existing pretrained language models for mental healthcare. This paper trains and release two pretrained masked language models, i.e., MentalBERT and MentalRoBERTa, to benefit machine learning for the mental healthcare research community.

On the one hand, node embedding can improve community detection since the detected communities are used to fit a community embedding.

Specifically, we define three main syntactic token types, namely time token, modifier, and numeral, to group time-related regular expressions over tokens. On the types we design general heuristic rules to recognize time expressions. In recognition, SynTime first identifies the time tokens from raw text, then searches their surroundings for modifiers and numerals to form time segments, and finally merges the time segments to time expressions. As a light-weight rule-based tagger, SynTime runs in real time, and can be easily expanded by simply adding keywords for the text of different types and of different domains. Experiment on benchmark datasets and tweets data shows that SynTime outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "Thanks to the breakthrough of large-scale pre-trained language model (PLM) technology, prompt-based classification tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis and emotion detection, have raised increasing attention.

Thus, one can use a PLM to infer the masked words in a downstream task, then obtaining label predictions with manually defined label-word mapping templates. Prompt-based affective computing takes the advantages of both neural network modeling and explainable symbolic representations.

In this paper, we, firstly, present a first of its kind Persian multimodal dataset comprising more than 800 utterances, as a benchmark resource for researchers to evaluate multimodal sentiment analysis approaches in Persian language. Secondly, we present a novel context-aware multimodal sentiment analysis framework, that simultaneously exploits acoustic, visual and textual cues to more accurately determine the expressed sentiment.

However, introducing explicit knowledge as exogenous variables has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed sentiment-aware volatility forecasting (SAVING), which incorporates market sentiment for stock return fluctuation prediction. Our framework provides an ensemble of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI approaches, that is, including grounded knowledge into a connectionist neural network. The model aims at producing a more accurate estimation of temporal variances of asset returns by better capturing the bi-directional interaction between movements of asset price and market sentiment.

Early detection of mental disorders and suicidal ideation from social content provides a potential way for effective social intervention. However, classifying suicidal ideation and other mental disorders is challenging as they share similar patterns in language usage and sentimental polarity. This paper enhances text representation with lexicon-based sentiment scores and latent topics and proposes using relation networks to detect suicidal ideation and mental disorders with related risk indicators. The relation module is further equipped with the attention mechanism to prioritize more critical relational features. Through experiments on three real-world datasets, our model outperforms most of its counterparts.", "SenticNet is a concept-level knowledge base used to develop commonsense reasoning algorithms for sentiment analysis tasks. One of the challenges that this resource must overcome is its lack of availability for languages aside from English. Prototype algorithms have been recently proposed to create non-English language concept-level knowledge databases, but they rely on a number of heterogeneous resources that complicate comparison, reproducibility and maintenance. This paper proposes an easy and replicable method to automatically generate SenticNet for a variety of languages, obtaining as a result BabelSenticNet. We use statistical machine translation tools to create a high coverage SenticNet version for the target language. We then introduce an algorithm to increase the robustness of the translated resources, relying on a mapping technique, based on WordNet and its multilingual versions\u00a0\u2026", "Gender-based-violence is a serious concern in recent times. Due to the social stigma attached to these assaults, victims rarely come forward. Implementing policy measures to prevent sexual violence get constrained due to lack of crime statistics. However, the recent outcry on the Twitter platform allows us to address this concern. Sexual assaults occur at workplaces, public places, educational institutes and also at home. Policy level approaches and awareness campaign for these assaults would not be similar. So, we want to identify the risk factor associated with these sexual assaults. We extracted 0.7 million tweets during the #MeToo social media movement. Next, we employ deep learning techniques to classify these sexual violences. We observe that sexual assaults by a family member at own home is a more serious concern than harassment by a stranger at public places.

There is growing demand to automate analysis of user sentiment towards products or services. Opinions are increasingly being shared online in the form of videos rather than text alone. This has led to SA using multiple modalities, termed Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), becoming an important research area. MSA utilises latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning at various stages including for multimodal feature extraction and fusion and sentiment polarity detection, with aims to minimize error rate and improve performance.

The purpose of MuSe 2021 is to bring together communities from different disciplines; mainly, the audio-visual emotion recognition community (signal-based), the sentiment analysis community (symbol-based), and the health informatics community. We present four distinct sub-challenges: MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Stress which focus on continuous emotion (valence and arousal) prediction; MuSe-Sent, in which participants recognise five classes each for valence and arousal; and MuSe-Physio, in which the novel aspect of 'physiological-emotion' is to be predicted.

Feature extraction plays a vital role, and follows two approaches: EMG and synergy features. More recently, muscle synergy based features are being increasingly explored, since it simplifies dimensionality of control, and are considered to be more robust to signal variations. Another important aspect in a myoelectrically controlled devices is the learning capability and speed of performance for online decoding. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a relatively new neural-network based learning algorithm: its performance hasn\u2019t been explored in the context of online control, which is a more reliable measure compared to offline analysis. To this purpose we aim at focusing our investigation on a myoelectric-based interface which is able to identify and online classify, upper limb motions involving shoulder and elbow. The main objective is to compare the performance of the decoder trained using ELM, for two different features: EMG and synergy features. The experiments are broadly divided in two phases training/calibration and testing respectively. ELM is used to train the decoder using data acquired during the calibration phase. The performance of the decoder is then tested in online motion control by using a simulated graphical user interface replicating the human limb: subjects are requested to control a virtual arm by using their muscular activity.

Recent development of emerging computational intelligence techniques such as extreme learning machines (ELM) and fast solutions shed some light upon how to effectively deal with these computational bottlenecks.", "Prior Twitter-based electoral research has mostly ignored multi-party contexts and \u2018mix tweets\u2019 that jointly mention more than one party. Hence, we investigate the complex nature of these mix tweets in a multi-party context, and we argue mix tweeting patterns of users implicitly capture their political opinions. We predict the political leaning of users based on their mix tweeting patterns in the context of the 2014 Indian General Election. We have agglomerated 2.4 million tweets from 0.15 million unique users. Next, we employ a multinomial logit regression model to test the hypothesized causal relation between mix tweeting patterns and the political leaning of users. Additionally, we also employ neural network-based algorithms to predict political leaning. Our study demonstrates that user-level mix-tweeting patterns can reveal the political opinions of Twitter users.", "Recently, the automatic prediction of personality traits has received increasing attention and has emerged as a hot topic within the field of affective computing.

Our primary goal is to develop a computationally efficient, high-performance personality prediction model which can be easily used by a large number of people without access to huge computation resources. Our extensive experiments with this ideology in mind, led us to develop a novel model which feeds contextualized embeddings along with psycholinguistic features toa Bagged-SVM classifier for personality trait prediction.

Interpretability, however, is a critical requirement for many downstream AI and NLP applications, eg, in finance, healthcare, and autonomous driving. This study, instead of proposing any \u201cnew model\u201d, investigates the error patterns of some widely acknowledged sentiment analysis methods in the finance domain. We discover that (1) those methods belonging to the same clusters are prone to similar error patterns, and (2) there are six types of linguistic features that are pervasive in the common errors. These findings provide important clues and practical considerations for improving sentiment analysis models for financial applications.", "People need to know other people\u2019s opinions to make well-informed decisions to buy products or services. Companies and organizations need to understand people\u2019s attitude towards their products and services and use feedback from the customers to improve their products. Sentiment analysis techniques address these needs. While the majority of Internet users are not English speakers, most research papers in the sentiment-analysis field focus on English; resources for other languages are scarce. In this paper, we introduce a Persian sentiment lexicon, which consists of 1500 words along with their part-of-speech tags and polarity scores.

Most importantly, DRL algorithms are also being employed in audio signal processing to learn directly from speech, music and other sound signals in order to create audio-based autonomous systems that have many promising applications in the real world. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the progress of DRL in the audio domain by bringing together research studies across different but related areas in speech and music.

Leveraging the polarity of multiword expressions\u2014or concepts\u2014rather than single words can mitigate the difficulty of such a task as these expressions carry more contextual information than isolated words. Such contextual information is the key to understanding both the syntactic and semantic structure of natural language text and hence is useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis. In this work, we propose a new method to enrich SenticNet (a publicly available knowledge base for concept-level sentiment analysis) with domain-level concepts composed of aspects and sentiment word pairs, along with a measure of their polarity.

Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo\u00a0\u2026", "Data augmentation is an effective solution to data scarcity in low-resource scenarios. However, when applied to token-level tasks such as NER, data augmentation methods often suffer from token-label misalignment, which leads to unsatsifactory performance. In this work, we propose Masked Entity Language Modeling (MELM) as a novel data augmentation framework for low-resource NER. To alleviate the token-label misalignment issue, we explicitly inject NER labels into sentence context, and thus the fine-tuned MELM is able to predict masked entity tokens by explicitly conditioning on their labels. Thereby, MELM generates high-quality augmented data with novel entities, which provides rich entity regularity knowledge and boosts NER performance. When training data from multiple languages are available, we also integrate MELM with code-mixing for further improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MELM on monolingual, cross-lingual and multilingual NER across various low-resource levels. Experimental results show that our MELM presents substantial improvement over the baseline methods.", "The Chinese pronunciation system offers two characteristics that distinguish it from other languages: deep phonemic orthography and intonation variations. In this paper, we hypothesize that these two important properties can play a major role in Chinese sentiment analysis. In particular, we propose two effective features to encode phonetic information and, hence, fuse it with textual information. With this hypothesis, we propose Disambiguate Intonation for Sentiment Analysis (DISA), a network that we develop based on the principles of reinforcement learning. DISA disambiguates intonations for each Chinese character (pinyin) and, hence, learns precise phonetic representations. We also fuse phonetic features with textual and visual features to further improve performance. Experimental results on five different Chinese sentiment analysis datasets show that the inclusion of phonetic features significantly and\u00a0\u2026", "Text representation in Chinese sentiment analysis is usually working at word or character level. In this paper, we prove that radical-level processing could greatly improve sentiment classification performance. In particular, we propose two types of Chinese radical-based hierarchical embeddings. The embeddings incorporate not only semantics at radical and character level, but also sentiment information. In the evaluation of our embeddings, we conduct Chinese sentiment analysis at sentence level on four different datasets. Experimental results validate our assumption that radical-level semantics and sentiments can contribute to sentence-level sentiment classification and demonstrate the superiority of our embeddings over classic textual features and popular word and character embeddings.", "Metaphor is a special linguistic phenomenon, challenging diverse natural language processing tasks. Previous works focused on either metaphor identification or domain-specific metaphor interpretation, e.g., interpreting metaphors with a specific part-of-speech, metaphors in a specific application scenario or metaphors with specific concepts. These methods cannot be used directly in everyday texts. In this paper, we propose a metaphor processing model, termed MetaPro, which integrates metaphor identification and interpretation modules for text pre-processing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end metaphor processing approach in the present field. MetaPro can identify metaphors in a sentence on token-level, paraphrasing the identified metaphors into their literal counterparts, and explaining metaphoric multi-word expressions.

This paper focuses on a specific kind of reviews: the suggestive type. Suggestions have a significant influence on both consumers\u2019 choices and designers\u2019 understanding and, hence, they are key for tasks such as brand positioning and social media marketing. The proposed approach consists of three main steps: (1) classify comparative and suggestive sentences; (2) categorize suggestive sentences into different types, either explicit or implicit locutions; (3) perform sentiment analysis on the classified reviews. A range of supervised machine learning approaches and feature sets are evaluated to tackle the problem of suggestive opinion mining. Experimental results for all three tasks are obtained on a dataset of mobile phone reviews and demonstrate that extending a bag-of-words representation with suggestive and comparative patterns is ideal for distinguishing suggestive sentences. In particular, it is observed that classifying suggestive sentences into implicit and explicit locutions works best when using a mixed sequential rule feature representation. Sentiment analysis achieves maximum performance when employing additional preprocessing in the form of negation handling and target masking, combined with sentiment lexicons.", "Social news are becoming increasingly popular. News organizations and popular journalists are starting to use social media more and more heavily for broadcasting news. The major challenge in social news clustering lies in the fact that textual content is only a headline, which is much shorter than the fulltext. Previous works showed that the bi-term topic model (BTM) is effective in modeling short text such as tweets. However, the drawback is that all non-stop terms are considered equally in forming the bi-terms. In this paper, a discriminative bi-term topic model (d-BTM) is presented, which tries to exclude less indicative bi-terms by discriminating topical terms from general and documentspecific ones. Experiments on TDT4 and Reuter-21578 show that using merely headlines, the d-BTM model is able to induce latent topics that are nearly as good as that are generated by LDA using news fulltext as evidence. The major contribution of this work lies in the empirical study on the reliability of topic modeling using merely news headlines.", "The goal of building intelligent dialogue systems has largely been separately pursued under two paradigms: task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, which perform task-specific functions, and open-domain dialogue (ODD) systems, which focus on non-goal-oriented chitchat. The two dialogue modes can potentially be intertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as easily done by a friendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in conversational agents, as the integration makes them more accessible and useful. Our paper addresses this problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn dialogues. Based on the popular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset FusedChat, by rewriting the existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This procedure constructs conversation sessions containing exchanges from both dialogue modes. It features inter-mode contextual dependency, ie, the dialogue turns from the two modes depend on each other. Rich dependency patterns such as co-reference and ellipsis are included. The new dataset, with 60k new human-written ODD turns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a benchmark to test a dialogue model's ability to perform inter-mode conversations. This is a more challenging task since the model has to determine the appropriate dialogue mode and generate the response based on the inter-mode context. However, such models would better mimic human-level conversation capabilities. We evaluate two baseline models on this task, including the classification-based two-stage models and the two-in-one fused models.

Despite their merits, some factors such as the unique architecture of GPUs, limited programming models, and irregular structures of graphs prevent GPU implementations from achieving high performance. Thus, this survey also discusses challenges and optimization techniques used by recent studies to fully utilize the GPU capability. A categorization of the existing research works is also presented based on the specific issues these attempted to solve.", "Metaphor is not only a linguistic phenomenon but also reflects the concept projection between source and target domains in human cognition. Previous sequence tagging-based metaphor identification methods could not model the concept projection, resulting in a limitation that the outputs of these models are unexplainable in the predictions of the metaphoricity labels. In this work, we propose the first explainable metaphor identification model, inspired by Conceptual Metaphor Theory. The model is based on statistic learning, a lexical resource, and a novel reward mechanism. Our model can identify the metaphoricity on the word-pair level, and explain the predicted metaphoricity labels via learned concept mappings. The use of the reward mechanism allows the model to learn the optimal concept mappings without knowing their true labels. Our method is also applicable for the concepts that are out of training domains by using the lexical resource. The automatically generated concept mappings demonstrate the implicit human thoughts in metaphoric expressions. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed model in metaphor identification, and concept mapping tasks, respectively.", "The bag-of-concepts model can represent semantics associated with natural language text much better than bags-of-words. In the bagof-words model, in fact, a concept such as cloud computing would be split into two separate words, disrupting the semantics of the input sentence. Working at concept-level is important for tasks such as opinion mining, especially in the case of microblogging analysis. In this work, we present Sentic API, a common-sense based application programming interface for concept-level sentiment analysis, which provides semantics and sentics (that is, denotative and connotative information) associated with 15,000 natural language concepts.", "In recent years, deep learning-based automated personality traits detection has received a lot of attention, especially now, due to the massive digital footprints of an individual. Moreover, many researchers have demonstrated that there is a strong link between personality traits and emotions.

Hence, ideal systems for interacting with people would be those capable of interpreting their environment cognitively, that is, similarly to how people do it.

In recent conferences and meetings [7, 8], we realized that the link between these fields has not received sufficient attention. In our opinion, recommendations should also be designed and evaluated considering cognitive factors.

In this article, we propose a context- and sentiment-aware framework, termed Sentic GAT, to solve this challenge. In Sentic GAT, common-sense knowledge is dynamically represented by the context- and sentiment-aware graph attention mechanism based on sentimental consistency, and context information is captured by the dialogue transformer (DT) with hierarchical multihead attention (HMAT), where HMAT is used to obtain the dependency of historical utterances on themselves and other utterances for better context representation\u00a0\u2026", "Question answering is a subfield of information retrieval.

However, the the development of Arabic QASs has been slowed by linguistic challenges and the lack of resources and tools available to researchers. In this survey, we start with the challenges due to the language and how these challenges make the development of new Arabic QAS more difficult. Next, we do a detailed review of several Arabic QASs.

We argue that the latent discrete variable interprets the intentions that guide machine responses generation. We also propose a model which can be refined autonomously with reinforcement learning, due to that intention selection at each dialogue turn can be formulated as a sequential decision-making process. Our experiments show that exact MLE optimized model is much more robust than neural variational inference on dialogue success rate with limited BLEU sacrifice.", "Most of the existing graph embedding methods focus on nodes, which aim to output a vector representation for each node in the graph such that two nodes being \"close\" on the graph are close too in the low-dimensional space. Despite the success of embedding individual nodes for graph analytics, we notice that an important concept of embedding communities (i.e., groups of nodes) is missing. Embedding communities is useful, not only for supporting various community-level applications, but also to help preserve community structure in graph embedding. In fact, we see community embedding as providing a higher-order proximity to define the node closeness, whereas most of the popular graph embedding methods focus on first-order and/or second-order proximities. To learn the community embedding, we hinge upon the insight that community embedding and node embedding reinforce with each other. As a result, we propose ComEmbed, the first community embedding method, which jointly optimizes the community embedding and node embedding together. We evaluate ComEmbed on real-world data sets. We show it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks of node classification and community prediction.", "RP is a simple and powerful dimension reduction technique that uses a suitably scaled random matrix with independent, normally distributed entries to project data into low-dimensional spaces.

The proposed model generates word vectors using pre-trained word embeddings. Moreover, this hybrid model extracts local features with many filters and different kernel sizes to model input words with long term dependency.

Machine learning and deep learning algorithms play an important role in this kind of task. Also, attention mechanism has shown breakthrough in the field of natural language processing.

With this in mind, the MuSe-Toolbox provides the functionality to run exhaustive searches for meaningful class clusters in the continuous gold standards. To our knowledge, this is the first toolkit that provides a wide selection of state-of-the-art emotional gold standard methods and their transformation to discrete classes. Experimental results indicate that MuSe-Toolbox can provide promising\u00a0\u2026", "Research on building dialogue systems that converse with humans naturally has recently attracted a lot of attention. Most work on this area assumes text-based conversation, where the user message is modeled as a sequence of words in a vocabulary. Real-world human conversation, in contrast, involves other modalities, such as voice, facial expression and body language, which can influence the conversation significantly in certain scenarios. In this work, we explore the impact of incorporating the audio features of the user message into generative dialogue systems. Specifically, we first design an auxiliary response retrieval task for audio representation learning. Then, we use word-level modality fusion to incorporate the audio features as additional context to our main generative model. Experiments show that our audio-augmented model outperforms the audio-free counterpart on perplexity, response diversity\u00a0\u2026", "This paper explores the Twitter deliberation as a response to the Supreme Court of India's verdict regarding the decriminalization of homosexuality. We have collected 0.58 million tweets to gauge the societal perception about the LGBT community whether social media users are supportive or skeptic about sexual minorities. Our deep learning algorithms (accuracy in the range of 85%) have outperformed machine learning algorithms (accuracy in the range of 60%). Furthermore, we note that dominant aspects of supporting tweets are revolving around equality, justice, human rights of the LGBT community. On the contrary, opposing tweets are perceiving this verdict as a threat to the Indian culture, tradition and the family system.", "Emotions and sentiments play a crucial role in our everyday lives. They aid decision-making, learning, communication, and situation awareness in humancentric environments. Over the past two decades, researchers in artificial intelligence have been attempting to endow machines with cognitive capabilities to recognize, infer, interpret, and express emotions and sentiments. All such efforts can be attributed to affective computing, an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, social sciences, and cognitive science. Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition has also become a new trend in social media, avidly helping users understand opinions being expressed on different platforms in the web. In this book, we focus on developing novel methods for text-based sentiment analysis. As an application of the developed methods, we employ them to improve multimodal polarity detection and emotion\u00a0\u2026", "ChatGPT has shown the potential of emerging general artificial intelligence capabilities, as it has demonstrated competent performance across many natural language processing tasks. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT to perform text classification on three affective computing problems, namely, big-five personality prediction, sentiment analysis, and suicide tendency detection. We utilize three baselines, a robust language model (RoBERTa-base), a legacy word model with pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec), and a simple bag-of-words (BoW) baseline. Results show that the RoBERTa model trained for a specific downstream task generally has a superior performance. On the other hand, ChatGPT provides decent results and is relatively comparable to the Word2Vec and BoW baselines. ChatGPT further shows robustness against noisy data, where the Word2Vec model achieves worse results\u00a0\u2026", "Sentic computing is a multi-disciplinary approach to sentiment analysis at the crossroads between affective computing and commonsense computing, which exploits both computer and social sciences to better recognize, interpret, and process opinions and sentiments over the Web. In the last ten years, many different models (such as the Hourglass of Emotions and Sentic Patterns), resources (such as AffectiveSpace and SenticNet), algorithms (such as Sentic LDA and Sentic LSTM), and applications (such as Sentic PROMs and Sentic Album) have been developed under the umbrella of sentic computing. In this paper, we review all such models, resources, algorithms, and applications together with the key shifts and tasks introduced by sentic computing in the context of affective computing and sentiment analysis. We also discuss future directions in these fields.", "We find from four datasets that time expressions are formed by loose structure and the words used to express time information can differentiate time expressions from common text. The findings drive us to design a learning method named TOMN to model time expressions. TOMN defines a time-related tagging scheme named TOMN scheme with four tags, namely \\tomnT,\\tomnO, \\tomnM,and \\tomnN, indicating the constituents of time expression, namely \\tomnT ime token, \\tomnM odifier, \\tomnN umeral, and the words \\tomnO utside time expression. In modeling, TOMN assigns a word with a TOMN tag under conditional random fields with minimal features. Essentially, our constituent-based TOMN scheme overcomes the problem of inconsistent tag assignment that is caused by the conventional position-based tagging schemes (\\eg BIO scheme and BILOU scheme). Experiments show that TOMN is equally or more\u00a0\u2026", "The ability to understand natural language text is far from being emulated in machines. One of the main hurdles to overcome is that computers lack both the common and the common sense knowledge humans normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. If we want machines to really understand natural language, we need to provide them with this kind of knowledge rather than relying on the valence of keywords and word co-occurrence frequencies. In this work, we blend the largest existing taxonomy of common knowledge with a natural-language-based semantic network of common sense knowledge, and use multi-dimensionality reduction techniques on the resulting knowledge base for opinion mining and sentiment analysis.", "Objective sentences lack sentiments and, hence, can reduce the accuracy of a sentiment classifier. Traditional methods prior to 2001 used hand-crafted templates to identify subjectivity and did not generalize well for resource-deficient languages such as Spanish. Later works published between 2002 and 2009 proposed the use of deep neural networks to automatically learn a dictionary of features (in the form of convolution kernels) that is portable to new languages. Recently, recurrent neural networks are being used to model alternating subjective and objective sentences within a single review. Such networks are difficult to train for a large vocabulary of words due to the problem of vanishing gradients. Hence, in this paper we consider use of a Lyapunov linear matrix inequality to classify Spanish text as subjective or objective by combining Spanish features and features obtained from the corresponding translated\u00a0\u2026", "With the introduction of social networks, blogs, wikis, etc., the users\u2019 behavior and their interaction in the Web have changed. As a consequence, people express their opinions and sentiments in a totally different way with respect to the past. All this information hinders potential business opportunities, especially within the advertising world, and key stakeholders need to catch up with the latest technology if they want to be at the forefront in the market. In practical terms, the automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text, and it has been proved that the use of semantics improves the accuracy of existing sentiment analysis systems based on classical machine learning or statistical approaches. To this end, the Concept Level Sentiment Analysis challenge aims to provide a push in this direction offering the researchers an event where they can learn new approaches\u00a0\u2026", "The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022 is dedicated to multimodal sentiment and emotion recognition.

However, the conventional position-based tagging schemes (e.g., the BIO and BILOU schemes) that previous research used to model time expressions and named entities suffer from the problem of inconsistent tag assignment. To overcome the problem of inconsistent tag assignment, we designed a new type of tagging schemes to model time expressions and named entities based on their constituents. Specifically, to model time expressions, we defined a constituent-based tagging scheme termed TOMN scheme with four tags, namely T, O, M, and N, indicating the defined constituents of time expressions, namely time token, modifier, numeral, and the words outside time expressions.

However, how market participants\u2019 behavior is affected by public mood has been rarely discussed. Consequently, there has been little progress in leveraging public mood for the asset allocation problem, which is preferred in a trusted and interpretable way. In order to address the issue of incorporating public mood analyzed from social media, we propose to formalize public mood into market views, because market views can be integrated into the modern portfolio theory. In our framework, the optimal market views will maximize returns in each period with a Bayesian asset allocation model. We train two neural models to generate the market views, and benchmark the model performance on other popular asset allocation strategies.

In this paper, a commonsense knowledge based algorithm for document topic modeling is presented. In contrast to probabilistic models, the proposed approach does not involve training of any kind and does not depend on word co-occurrence or particular word distributions, making the algorithm effective on texts of any length and composition. 'Semantic atoms' are used to generate feature vectors for document concepts. These features are then clustered using group average agglomerative clustering, providing much improved performance over existing algorithms.", "Thanks to the advent of Web 2.0, the potential for opinion sharing today is unmatched in history. Making meaning out of the huge amount of unstructured information available online, however, is extremely difficult as web-contents, despite being perfectly suitable for human consumption, still remain hardly accessible to machines. To bridge the cognitive and affective gap between word-level natural language data and the concept-level sentiments conveyed by them, affective common sense knowledge is needed. In sentic computing, the general common sense knowledge contained in ConceptNet is usually exploited to spread affective information from selected affect seeds to other concepts. In this work, besides exploiting the emotional content of the Open Mind corpus, we also collect new affective common sense knowledge through label sequential rules, crowd sourcing, and games-with-a-purpose techniques. In particular, we develop Open Mind Common Sentics, an emotion-sensitive IUI that serves both as a platform for affective common sense acquisition and as a publicly available NLP tool for extracting the cognitive and affective information associated with short texts.", "The exponential growth of social media and online social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok) has changed the daily lives of millions of people. The ease to accessing, gathering and processing available data and the high societal and industrial interest in such data have attracted the interest of a large of research disciplines. This special issue has been focused mainly on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence techniques, and their application to social network analysis. The issue provides a total of 12 selected papers (out of 65) that represent latest advances and developments in these areas.", "Aspect-based sentiment analysis enables the extraction of fine-grained information, as it connects specific aspects that appear in reviews with a polarity. Although we detect that the information from these algorithms is very accurate at local level, it does not contribute to obtain an overall understanding of reviews. To fill this gap, we propose a methodology to portray opinions through the most relevant associations between aspects and polarities. Our methodology combines three off-the-shelf algorithms: (1) deep learning for extracting aspects, (2) clustering for joining together similar aspects, and (3) subgroup discovery for obtaining descriptive rules that summarize the polarity information of set of reviews. Concretely, we aim at depicting negative opinions from three cultural monuments in order to detect those features that need to be improved.

Most existing black-box-like deep learning methods for depression detection largely focused on improving classification performance. However, explaining model decisions is imperative in health research because decision-making can often be high-stakes and life-and-death. Reliable automatic diagnosis of mental health problems including depression should be supported by credible explanations justifying models' predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explainable model for depression detection on Twitter. It comprises a novel encoder combining hierarchical attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. To support psycholinguistic studies, our model leverages metaphorical concept mappings as input. Thus, it not only detects depressed individuals, but also identifies features of such users' tweets and associated metaphor concept mappings.", "Stock market serves as an important indicator of today\u2019s economy. Predicting the price fluctuation of stocks and acquiring the maximum gains has been the main concern of investors. In recent years, deep learning models are widely applied to stock market prediction and have achieved good performances. However, the majority of these deep learning based models belong to supervised learning methods and are not capable of dealing with long-term targets. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a deep reinforcement learning based stock market trading model, which is suitable for predicting stock price fluctuation and stock transactions. We carefully devise the reward function and deep learning based policy network, which enables the model to capture the hidden dependencies and latent dynamics in the stock data.

This paper applies the technique for the automatic classification of speech utterances. Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC) are employed as feature vectors and ELM performs the final classification. Both the baseline ELM algorithm and ELM with kernel have been employed and tested. Due to the fixed number of input neurons in the ELM, a length normalization algorithm is employed to transform the PNCC sequence into a vector of fixed length. Length normalization has been performed using two techniques: the first is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances, the second on the vectorized outerproduct of trajectory matrix.

As a consequence, several surveys have been published to explore the current state of the art on this topic. One aspect that seems to be overlooked by these works is the applied presentation methods and, specifically, the role of natural language in generating the final explanations. This survey reviews 70 XAI papers published between 2006 and 2021 and evaluates their readiness with respect to natural language explanations. Thus, together with a set of hierarchical criteria, we define a multi-criteria decision-making model. Finally, we conclude that only a handful of recent XAI works either considered natural language explanations to approach final users (see, e.g.,(Bennetot et al., 2021)) or implemented a method capable of generating such explanations.", "In the era of social networking and e-commerce sites, users provide their feedback and comments in the form of reviews for any product, topic, or organization. Due to high influence of reviews on users, spammers use fake reviews to promote their product/organization and to demote the competitors. It is estimated that approximately 14% of reviews on any platform are fake reviews. Several researchers have proposed various approaches to detect fake reviews. The limitation of existing approaches is that complete review text is analysed which increases computation time and degrades accuracy. In our proposed approach, aspects are extracted from reviews and only these aspects and respective sentiments are employed for fake reviews detection. Extracted aspects are fed into CNN for aspect replication learning. The replicated aspects are fed into LSTM for fake reviews detection.

The emergence of deep models in natural language processing has boosted the development of automatic assignment methods. However, recent advanced neural architectures with flat convolutions or multi-channel feature concatenation ignore the sequential causal constraint within a text sequence and may not learn meaningful clinical text representations, especially for lengthy clinical notes with long-term sequential dependency. This paper proposes a Dilated Convolutional Attention Network (DCAN), integrating dilated convolutions, residual connections, and label attention, for medical code assignment. It adopts dilated convolutions to capture complex medical patterns with a receptive field which increases exponentially with dilation size. Experiments on a real-world clinical dataset empirically show that our model improves the state of the art.", "Human civilizations have performed the art of writing across continents and over different time periods. In order to speed up the writing process, the art of shorthand (brachygraphy) came into existence. Today, the performance of writing does not make an exception in social media platforms.

This paper focuses on microtext approaches predominantly found in social media and explains the relevance of microtext normalization for natural language processing tasks in English. The review introduces brachygraphy and how it has evolved into microtext in today\u2019s social media\u2013dominant society.

In the area of image polarity detection, CNNs are customarily utilized in combination with transfer learning techniques to tackle a major problem: the unavailability of large sets of labeled data. Thus, polarity predictors in general exploit a pre-trained CNN as the feature extractor that in turn feeds a classification unit. While the latter unit is trained from scratch, the pre-trained CNN is subject to fine-tuning. As a result, the specific CNN architecture employed as the feature extractor strongly affects the overall performance of the model. This paper analyses state-of-the-art literature on image polarity detection and identifies the most reliable CNN architectures. Moreover, the paper provides an experimental protocol that should allow assessing the role played by the baseline architecture in the polarity detection task. Performance is evaluated in terms of both generalization abilities and computational complexity. The latter attribute becomes critical as polarity predictors, in the era of social networks, might need to be updated within hours or even minutes. In this regard, the paper gives practical hints on the advantages and disadvantages of the examined architectures both in terms of generalization and computational cost.", "In healthcare services, information extraction is the key to understand any corpus-based knowledge. The process becomes laborious when the annotation is done manually for the availability of a large number of text corpora. Hence, future automated extraction systems will be essential for groups of experts such as doctors and medical practitioners as well as non-experts such as patients, to ensure enhanced clinical decision-making for improving healthcare systems. Such extraction systems can be developed using medical concepts and concept-related features as the part of a structured corpus. The latter can assist in assigning the category and sentiment to each of the medical concepts and their lexical contexts. These categories and sentiment assignments constitute semantic relations of medical concepts, with their context, represented by sentences of the corpus.

Mining opinions and sentiments from natural language, however, is an extremely difficult task as it involves a deep understanding of most of the explicit and implicit, regular and irregular and syntactical and semantic rules appropriate of a language. Existing approaches to sentiment analysis mainly rely on parts of text in which opinions are explicitly expressed such as polarity terms, affect words and their co-occurrence frequencies. However, opinions and sentiments are often conveyed implicitly through latent semantics, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective.Natural language\u00a0\u2026", "The ways people express their opinions and sentiments have radically changed in the past few years thanks to the advent of social networks, web communities, blogs, wikis, and other online collaborative media.

In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence. With this, our polarity detection engine outperforms the state-ofthe-art statistical methods.", "Sentiment analysis research mainly aims to determine the orientation of an opinionated stretch of text into positive or negative polarity.

In this paper, bi-tagged phrases are used as features in combination with unigram features for sentiment classification. Joint feature vectors of unigrams and bi-tagged phrases have high dimensions consisting of noisy and irrelevant features.

The paper tackles two crucial aspects of the sentiment classification problem: first, the computational complexity of the deployed framework; second, the ability of the framework itself to operate effectively in heterogeneous commercial domains. The proposed approach adopts empirical learning to implement the sentiment-classification technology, and uses a distance-based predictive model to combine computational efficiency and modularity.

In this paper, we propose a sequential fusion method for facial depression recognition. For mining the correlated and complementary depression patterns in multimodal learning, a chained-fusion mechanism is introduced to jointly learn facial appearance and dynamics in a unified framework.

Thus, we propose a novel Multi-source Aggregated Classification (MAC) method for stock price movement prediction. MAC incorporates the numerical features and market-driven news sentiments of target stocks, as well as the news sentiments of their related stocks.

Representative chaotic time series produced by different system dimensions are introduced with a critical parameter linearly depending on time. The evolving character of systems are qualitatively studied by phase portraits. We assess the predictability of different fuzzy neural network (FNN) architectures on several evolving chaotic time series. Experiments illustrate that FNN models can generally better approximate evolving chaotic systems comparing to the autoregression method as a benchmark. The main contribution of our work is that we found out certain FNN types, e.g., NEFCON and DENFIS, are more robust to changing system parameters. In spite of the performance, some FNN models are more vulnerable and incline to be destabilized by high order chaotic systems.

However, the ERC task is challenging, largely due to the complex and unstructured properties of multi-party conversations. Besides, the majority of daily dialogues take place in a specific context or circumstance, which requires rich external knowledge to understand the background of a certain dialogue. In this paper, we address these challenges by explicitly modeling the discourse relations between utterances and incorporating symbolic knowledge into multi-party conversations. We first introduce a dialogue parsing algorithm into ERC and further improve the algorithm through a transfer learning method. Moreover, we leverage different symbolic knowledge graph relations to learn knowledge-enhanced features for the ERC task. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that both dialogue structure graphs and symbolic knowledge are beneficial to the model performance on the task. Additionally, experimental results indicate that the proposed model surpasses baseline models on several indices.", "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing facts based on the observed ones, which is significant for many downstream applications. Given the success of deep learning and pre-trained language models (LMs), some LM-based methods are proposed for the KGC task. However, most of them focus on modeling the text of fact triples and ignore the deeper semantic information (e.g., topology contexts and logical rules) that is significant for KG modeling. For such a reason, we propose a unified framework FTL-LM to Fuse Topology contexts and Logical rules in Language Models for KGC, which mainly contains a novel path-based method for topology contexts learning and a variational expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm for soft logical rule distilling. The former utilizes a heterogeneous random-walk to generate topology paths and further reasoning paths that can represent topology contexts\u00a0\u2026", "Human conversations are guided by short-term and long-term goals. We study how to plan short-term goal sequences as coherently as humans do and naturally direct them to an assigned long-term goal in open-domain conversations. Goal sequences are a series of knowledge graph (KG) entity-relation connections generated by KG walkers that traverse through the KG. The existing recurrent and graph attention based KG walkers either insufficiently utilize the conversation states or lack global guidance. In our work, a hierarchical model learns goal planning in a hierarchical learning framework. We present HiTKG, a hierarchical transformer-based graph walker that leverages multiscale inputs to make precise and flexible predictions on KG paths. Furthermore, we propose a two-hierarchy learning framework that employs two stages to learn both turn-level (short-term) and global-level (long-term) conversation goals. Specifically, at the first stage, HiTKG is trained in a supervised fashion to learn how to plan turn-level goal sequences; at the second stage, HiTKG tries to naturally approach the assigned global goal via reinforcement learning. In addition, we propose MetaPath as the backbone method for KG path representation to exploit the entity and relation information concurrently. We further propose Multi-source Decoding Inputs and Output-level Length Head to improve the decoding controllability. Our experiments show that HiTKG achieves a significant improvement in the performance of turn-level goal learning compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

The initial WME resource contains 1654 medical terms or concepts. In the present research, we have reported the enhancement of WME with 6415 number of medical concepts along with their conceptual features viz. Parts-of-Speech (POS), gloss, semantics, polarity, sense and affinity. Several polarity lexicons viz. SentiWordNet, SenticNet, Bing Liu\u2019s subjectivity list and Taboda\u2019s adjective list were introduced with WordNet synonyms and hyponyms for expansion. The semantics feature guided us to build a semantic co-reference relation based network between the related medical concepts. These features help to prepare a medical concept network for better sense relation based visualization. Finally, we evaluated with respect to Adaptive Lesk Algorithm and conducted an agreement analysis for validating the expanded WME resource.", "Web users continue to evolve with the rapidly evolving Web. In an era of social connectedness, people are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and collaborating through social networks, online communities, blogs, Wikis, as well as a range of other online collaborative media. In recent years, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas, with a particular focus in fields related to everyday life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health, causing the size of the Web to expand exponentially. The distillation of knowledge from such a large amount of unstructured information, however, remains an extremely difficult task, since the contents of today\u2019s Web are perfectly suitable for human consumption, yet hardly accessible to machines.The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public on social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences, has raised growing interest both within the scientific community, leading to many exciting open challenges, as well as in the business world, due to the remarkable benefits expected from marketing and financial market prediction. Existing approaches to opinion mining mainly rely on parts of text in which sentiment is explicitly expressed, eg, through polarity terms or affect words (and their cooccurrence frequencies). However, opinions and sentiments are often conveyed implicitly through latent semantics, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective.", "In a world in which web users are continuously blasted by ads and often compelled to deal with user-unfriendly interfaces, we sometimes feel like we want to evade from the sensory overload of standard web pages and take refuge in a safe web corner, in which contents and design are in harmony with our current frame of mind.

This social information, however, is often stored in natural language text and hence intrinsically unstructured, which makes comparison with the structured information supplied by health-care providers very difficult. To bridge the gap between these data, which though different at structure-level are similar at concept-level, we exploit the semantics and sentics, ie the cognitive and affective information, associated with on-line patient opinions and, hence, provide the end-users of the health system with a common framework to compare, validate and select their health-care providers.", "The ICML Expressive Vocalization (ExVo) Competition is focused on understanding and generating vocal bursts: laughs, gasps, cries, and other non-verbal vocalizations that are central to emotional expression and communication. ExVo 2022, includes three competition tracks using a large-scale dataset of 59,201 vocalizations from 1,702 speakers. The first, ExVo-MultiTask, requires participants to train a multi-task model to recognize expressed emotions and demographic traits from vocal bursts. The second, ExVo-Generate, requires participants to train a generative model that produces vocal bursts conveying ten different emotions. The third, ExVo-FewShot, requires participants to leverage few-shot learning incorporating speaker identity to train a model for the recognition of 10 emotions conveyed by vocal bursts. This paper describes the three tracks and provides performance measures for baseline models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies. The baseline for each track is as follows, for ExVo-MultiTask, a combined score, computing the harmonic mean of Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), Unweighted Average Recall (UAR), and inverted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) () is at best, 0.335 ; for ExVo-Generate, we report Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID) scores ranging from 4.81 to 8.27 (depending on the emotion) between the training set and generated samples. We then combine the inverted FID with perceptual ratings of the generated samples () and obtain 0.174 ; and for ExVo-FewShot, a mean CCC of 0.444 is obtained.", "Zero-shot learning \u2014 the problem of training and testing on a completely disjoint set of classes \u2014 relies greatly on its ability to transfer knowledge from train classes to test classes. Traditionally semantic embeddings consisting of human-defined attributes or distributed word embeddings are used to facilitate this transfer by improving the association between visual and semantic embeddings. In this paper, we take advantage of explicit relations between nodes defined in ConceptNet, a commonsense knowledge graph, to generate commonsense embeddings of the class labels by using a graph convolution network-based autoencoder. Our experiments performed on three standard benchmark datasets surpass the strong baselines when we fuse our commonsense embeddings with existing semantic embeddings, i.e., human-defined attributes and distributed word embeddings.

To fill this gap for Persian language, in our previous work we have compiled the first version of PerSent Persian sentiment lexicon, which was small and included only words and phrases from general domain. In this paper, we present its extension with words from three different domains and evaluate its performance on polarity classification task using various machine learning-based classifiers.

However, it is very challenging to effectively fuse multimodal features to understand the detailed contextual information in conversations. In this work, we focus on dynamic interactions during the information fusion process and propose a Dynamic Interactive Multiview Memory Network (DIMMN) model to integrate interaction information for recognizing emotions. Specifically, the information fusion within DIMMN is through multiple perspectives (combining different modalities). We designed multiview layers in attention networks to enable the model to mine the crossmodal dynamic dependencies between different groups in the process of dynamic modal interaction.

However, in a label intensive research domain, e.g., few-shot relation extraction (RE), manually defining label word mappings is particularly challenging, because the number of utilized relation label classes with complex relation names can be extremely large. Besides, the manual prompt development in natural language is subjective to individuals. To tackle these issues, we propose a virtual prompt pre-training method, projecting the virtual prompt to latent space, then fusing with PLM parameters.

Therefore, we provide a mathematical explanation of neural tensor networks and also reveal the inner link between them and feedforward neural networks from the perspective of Taylor\u2019s theorem. In addition, we unify two forms of neural tensor networks into a single framework and present factorization methods to make the neural tensor networks parameter-efficient.

To solve this problem, the concept of house popularity is well defined in this paper. Specifically, the house popularity is decided by inter-event timeand rating score at the same time. To make a more effective prediction over these two correlated variables, a dual-gated recurrent unit (DGRU) is employed.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of analyzing the timing and the impact that news have on the stock market. We focus on two different important aspects: the possible contribution that new information can have on the stock price and its possible relation with the aggregate news recently published.

In this paper, we develop and apply recent subjectivity detection techniques to determine subjective and objective tweets towards the hot topic of nuclear energy. This will further help us to detect the presence or absence of social media bias towards Nuclear Energy. In particular, significant network motifs of words and concepts were learned in dynamic Gaussian Bayesian networks, while using Twitter as a source of information. We use reinforcement learning to update each weight based on a probabilistic reward function over all the weights and, hence, to regularize the sentence model. The proposed framework opens new avenues in helping government agencies manage online public opinion to decide and act according to the need of the hour.", "Subjectivity detection can prevent a sentiment classifier from considering irrelevant or potentially misleading text. Since, different attributes may correspond to different opinions in the lexicon of different languages, we resort to multiple kernel learning (MKL) to simultaneously optimize the different modalities. Previous approaches to MKL for sentence classifiers are computationally slow and lack any hierarchy when grouping features into different kernels. In this paper, we consider deep recurrent convolution neural networks to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. Further, the lower layers in a deep model are abstract and the higher layers become more detailed connecting attributes to opinions. Hence, the features learned automatically in the multiple intermediate layers can be used to train MKL classifiers depending on the application. The proposed deep recurrent MKL outperforms the accuracy of baselines by over 5-30% and is several times faster on two benchmark datasets for subjectivity detection. It can also be used to develop subjectivity lexicons in other languages using English.", "This paper explores nuclear energy-related Twitter discussions as a response to the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Disaster and the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize won by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. We have considered a total of 2 million tweets for these two events.

Our AI algorithms have performed better for polarity detection (accuracy in the range of 90%) with respect to subjectivity detection (accuracy in the range of 75%). We also note that dominant aspects of supporting tweets revolve around concepts like clean energy, lower CO2 emission, and sustainable future. On the contrary, cynical users see nuclear energy as a threat to the environment, human life, and safety.", "With the current upsurge in the usage of social media platforms, the trend of using short text (microtext) in place of text with standard words has seen a significant rise.

We develop binary classifier to detect OOV sentences and then they are transformed to phoneme subspace using grapheme to phoneme converter.

In order for machines to exploit common sense knowledge in reasoning as humans do, moreover, we need to endow them with human-like reasoning strategies. In problem-solving situations, in particular, several analogous representations of the same problem should be maintained in parallel while trying to solve it so that, when problem-solving begins to fail while using one representation, the system can switch to one of the others.

In addition, the manual annotators help to validate the overall as well as individual category level of medical concepts of WME 3.0 using Cohen\u2019s Kappa agreement metric. The agreement score indicates almost correct identification of medical concepts and their assigned features in WME 3.0.", "Social and expressive media represent a challenge and a push forward for research on emotion and sentiment analysis. The advent of social media has brought about new paradigms of interaction that foster first-person engagement and crowdsourced contents: the subjective dimension moves to the foreground, opening the way to the emergence of an affective component within a dynamic corpus of digitized contents created and enriched by the users. Expressive media, which play a key role in fields related to creativity, such as figurative arts, music or drama, gather multimedia contents into online social environments, by joining the social dimension with the aims of artistic creation and self-expression. Artistic creation and performance seem to be a very interesting testbed for cross-validating and possibly integrating approaches, models and tools for automatically analyzing emotion and sentiment.

Aspects mentioned by review authors can be expressed in various forms, resulting in a potentially large number of missing or incomplete aspects. This work proposes a novel unsupervised method to extract aspects from raw reviews with a broader coverage. Previous research has shown that unsupervised methods based on dependency relations are promising for opinion target extraction (OTE). In this work, we introduce Aspect Network (AspNet), an AspNet that further improves existing OTE methods by providing a new framework for modeling aspects. AspNet represents the general indecomposable atom aspects and their dependency relations in a two-layered, directed, weighted graph, based on which the specific decomposable compound aspects in reviews can\u00a0\u2026", "Sentic Net is a popular resource for concept-level sentiment analysis. Because Sentic Net was created specifically for opinion mining in English language, however, its localization can be very laborious. In this work, a toolkit for creating non-English versions of Sentic Net in a time- and cost-effective way is proposed. This is achieved by exploiting online facilities such as Web dictionaries and translation engines. The challenging issues are three: firstly, when a Web lexicon is used, one sentiment concept in English can usually be mapped to multiple concepts in the local language. In this work, we develop a concept disambiguation algorithm to discover context within texts in the target language. Secondly, the polarity of some concepts in the local language may be different from the counterpart in English, which is referred to as language-dependent sentiment concepts. An algorithm is developed to detect sentiment\u00a0\u2026", "With the growth of social platforms in recent years and the rapid increase in the means of communication through these platforms, a significant amount of textual data is available that contains an abundance of individuals\u2019 opinions. Sentiment analysis is a task that supports companies and organizations to evaluate this textual data with the intention of understanding people\u2019s thoughts concerning services or products. Most previous research in Arabic sentiment analysis relies on word frequencies, lexicons, or black box methods to determine the sentiment of a sentence. It should be noted that these approaches do not take into account the semantic relations and dependencies between words. In this work, we propose a framework that incorporates Arabic dependency-based rules and deep learning models. Dependency-based rules are created by using linguistic patterns to map the meaning of words to concepts in\u00a0\u2026", "Supply chain management (SCM) is a complex network of multiple entities ranging from business partners to end consumers. These stakeholders frequently use social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, to voice their opinions and concerns. AI-based applications, such as sentiment analysis, allow us to extract relevant information from these deliberations. We argue that the context-specific application of AI, compared to generic approaches, is more efficient in retrieving meaningful insights from social media data for SCM. We present a conceptual overview of prevalent techniques and available resources for information extraction. Subsequently, we have identified specific areas of SCM where context-aware sentiment analysis can enhance the overall efficiency.", "Video engagement is important in online advertisements where there is no physical interaction with the consumer. Engagement can be directly measured as the number of seconds after which a consumer skips an advertisement. In this paper, we propose a model to predict video engagement of an advertisement using only a few samples. This allows for early identification of poor quality videos. This can also help identify advertisement frauds where a robot runs fake videos behind the name of well-known brands. We leverage on the fact that videos with high engagement have similar viewing patterns over time. Hence, we can create a similarity network of videos and use a graph-embedding model called DeepWalk to cluster videos into significant communities. The learned embedding is able to identify viewing patterns of fraud and popular videos. In order to assess the impact of a video, we also consider how the\u00a0\u2026", "The fast growth of social media platforms and their related applications have dramatically changed the way billions of people relate to each other on the Web. This evolution of social media has blossomed in a plethora of end-user, or user-centered, applications that required innovative and efficient techniques for data processing. This was made possible recently thanks to advances in data science and artificial intelligence in fields like pattern recognition, information fusion, knowledge discovery and data visualization. This special issue provides a set of 12 selected papers (out of 65 submissions) that represent latest advances and developments in these areas.", "In this paper, we describe our team\u2019s (JUSTers) effort in the Commonsense Validation and Explanation (ComVE) task, which is part of SemEval2020. We evaluate five pre-trained Transformer-based language models with various sizes against the three proposed subtasks. For the first two subtasks, the best accuracy levels achieved by our models are 92.90% and 92.30%, respectively, placing our team in the 12th and 9th places, respectively. As for the last subtask, our models reach 16.10 BLEU score and 1.94 human evaluation score placing our team in the 5th and 3rd places according to these two metrics, respectively. The latter is only 0.16 away from the 1st place human evaluation score.", "Business taxonomies are indispensable tools for investors to do equity research and make professional decisions. However, to identify the structure of industry sectors in an emerging market is challenging for two reasons. First, existing taxonomies are designed for mature markets, which may not be the appropriate classification for small companies with innovative business models. Second, emerging markets are fast-developing, thus the static business taxonomies cannot promptly reflect the new features. In this article, we propose a new method to construct business taxonomies automatically from the content of corporate annual reports. Extracted concepts are hierarchically clustered using greedy affinity propagation. Our method requires less supervision and is able to discover new terms. Experiments and evaluation on the Chinese National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) market show several advantages of the business taxonomy we build. Our results provide an effective tool for understanding and investing in the new growth companies.", "In healthcare, information extraction is essential in building automatic domain-specific applications. Medical concepts and their semantic identification take an important role to develop a network for visualizing medical concepts and their relations. The challenge appears while available medical corpora are only in either unstructured or semi-structured forms. In the present paper, to overcome the challenge and consequently to construct a structured corpus, we apply a domain-specific lexicon, namely WordNet of Medical Event. Medical concepts assigned by this lexicon and their affinity score, polarity score, sense, and semantic features assist in identifying conceptual and sentiment relations from the corpus. The lexicon and all these features provide an essential support to analyze an unstructured corpus and represent it in a structured corpus which we term MediConceptNet: the medical concepts are connected with each other through the concerned features. A previously suggested network for the same purpose, eg, SemNet, is only based on the semantic and affinity features. The semantic relations of the concepts can be successfully determined in three distinct ranges, eg, 0 for no relation, 0-1 for partial relations, and 1 corresponding a full relation. To evaluate the data of MediConceptNet, we apply an agreement analysis provided by the Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient and achieve 0.66 agreement score, evaluating the comparative statistics of two medical practitioners working as manual annotators.", "In this paper, we present Singlish SenticNet, a concept-level knowledge base for sentiment analysis that associates multiword expressions to a set of emotion labels and a polarity value. Unlike many other sentiment analysis resources, SenticNet is not built by manually labeling pieces of knowledge coming from general NLP resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. Instead, it is automatically constructed by applying graph-mining and multi-dimensional scaling techniques on the affective common-sense knowledge collected from three different sources. This knowledge is represented redundantly at three levels: semantic network, matrix, and vector space. Subsequently, the concepts are labeled by emotions and polarity through the ensemble application of spreading activation, neural networks and an emotion categorization model.", "Cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) suffers from data scarcity in the target languages, especially under zero-shot settings. Existing translate-train or knowledge distillation methods attempt to bridge the language gap, but often introduce a high level of noise. To solve this problem, consistency training methods regularize the model to be robust towards perturbations on data or hidden states. However, such methods are likely to violate the consistency hypothesis, or mainly focus on coarse-grain consistency. We propose ConNER as a novel consistency training framework for cross-lingual NER, which comprises of: (1) translation-based consistency training on unlabeled target-language data, and (2) dropoutbased consistency training on labeled source-language data. ConNER effectively leverages unlabeled target-language data and alleviates overfitting on the source language to enhance the cross-lingual adaptability. Experimental results show our ConNER achieves consistent improvement over various baseline methods.", "In recent years, the traditional way of getting news from a Television, news paper, or national newscast is gone. Today, online social media provides the fastest news content for people. This, however, brings about the problem of fake news. In fact, fake news detection is one of the challenging tasks in natural language processing to differentiate between real (or true) and fake (or false) news content. In this paper, we propose an XLNet fine-tuning model to predict fake news in a multi-class and binary class problem. Our results show that the proposed XLNet model comparatively achieves a better result than the existing state-of-the-art models.", "Mapping continuous dimensional emotion to discrete classes is an extremely difficult task. In this paper, we predict the intensity classes of emotions based on valence and arousal in segments of audio-visual recordings about car reviews. Consequently, for unimodal features, we first employ baseline methods and principal component analysis to search for the best unimodal features in different modalities, which can simplify the relationship between feature attributes. For multimodal features, we perform multimodal fusion on the best and other unimodal features through an early fusion strategy. For sentiment analysis, we propose six hybrid temporal models for modeling complex time dependencies. To avoid overfitting the validation set and providing complementary information between different modalities, we propose a multitask learning framework, which can adaptively change the weight of loss per subtask.", "Medical coding translates professionally written medical reports into standardized codes, which is an essential part of medical information systems and health insurance reimbursement. Manual coding by trained human coders is time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, automated coding algorithms have been developed, building especially on the recent advances in machine learning and deep neural networks. To solve the challenges of encoding lengthy and noisy clinical documents and capturing code associations, we propose a multitask recalibrated aggregation network. In particular, multitask learning shares information across different coding schemes and captures the dependencies between different medical codes. Feature recalibration and aggregation in shared modules enhance representation learning for lengthy notes. Experiments with a real-world MIMIC-III dataset show significantly improved\u00a0\u2026", "There is a large variety of products sold online and the websites are in several languages. Hence, it is desirable to train a model that can predict sentiments in different domains simultaneously. Previous authors have used deep learning to extract features from multiple domains. Here, each word is represented by a vector that is determined using co-occurrence data. Such a model requires that all sentences have the same length resulting in low accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we model the features in each sentence using a variable length tree called a Genetic Program. The polarity of clauses can be represented using mathematical operators such as '+' or '-' at internal nodes in the tree. The proposed model is evaluated on Amazon product reviews for different products and in different languages. We are able to outperform the accuracy of baseline multi-domain models in the range of 5-20%.", "SenticNet is a publicly available resource for opinion mining that exploits AI, linguistics, and psychology to infer the polarity associated with commonsense concepts and encode this in a semantic-aware representation. In particular, SenticNet uses dimensionality reduction to calculate the affective valence of multi-word expressions and, hence, represent it in a machine-accessible and machine-processable format. This chapter presents an overview of the most recent sentic computing tools and techniques, with particular focus on applications in the context of big social data analysis.", "A huge number of videos are posted each day on social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook etc. It makes the Internet an almost unlimited source of information. In the coming decades it will become increasingly challenging for researchers to cope with this information and mine useful knowledge from it. In this paper, we address the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis ie harvesting sentiment from Web videos by demonstrating a novel model which uses audio, visual and textual modalities as sources of information. Here, we first extract information from three modalities and then fuse these at both feature and decision level. We employ a kernel based fusion method to fuse the information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art works in this area is carried out. In preliminary experiments using the YouTube dataset, our proposed multimodal system is shown to achieve an accuracy of 78.20%, outperforming the best state-of-the-art systems by more than 22.90%.", "Over the past few decades, multimodal emotion recognition has made remarkable progress with the development of deep learning. However, existing technologies are difficult to meet the demand for practical applications. To improve the robustness, we launch a Multimodal Emotion Recognition Challenge (MER 2023) to motivate global researchers to build innovative technologies that can further accelerate and foster research. For this year's challenge, we present three distinct sub-challenges: (1) MER-MULTI, in which participants recognize both discrete and dimensional emotions; (2) MER-NOISE, in which noise is added to test videos for modality robustness evaluation; (3) MER-SEMI, which provides large amounts of unlabeled samples for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we test a variety of multimodal features and provide a competitive baseline for each sub-challenge. Our system achieves 77.57% on the F1 score and 0.82 on the mean squared error (MSE) for MER-MULTI, 69.82% on the F1 score and 1.12 on MSE for MER-NOISE, and 86.75% on the F1 score for MER-SEMI, respectively.

In this paper, we showcase the fact that the polarity detection and subjectivity detection subtasks of sentiment analysis are inter-related. To this end, we propose a knowledge-sharing-based multitask learning framework. To ensure high-quality knowledge sharing between the tasks, we use the Neural Tensor Network, which consists of a bilinear tensor layer that links the two entity vectors. We show that BERT-based embedding with our MTL framework outperforms the baselines and achieves a new state-of-the-art status in multitask learning. Our framework shows that the information across datasets for related tasks can be helpful for understanding task-specific features.", "Routing methods in capsule networks often learn a hierarchical relationship for capsules in successive layers, but the intra-relation between capsules in the same layer is less studied, while this intra-relation is a key factor for the semantic understanding in text data. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new capsule network with graph routing to learn both relationships, where capsules in each layer are treated as the nodes of a graph. We investigate strategies to yield adjacency and degree matrix with three different distances from a layer of capsules, and propose the graph routing mechanism between those capsules. We validate our approach on five text classification datasets, and our findings suggest that the approach combining bottom-up routing and top-down attention performs the best. Such an approach demonstrates generalization capability across datasets.

Today, social media is becoming ubiquitous in two senses:(1) it crosses boundaries and expands to more nations, and (2) it deeply intervenes in our personal life and economic activities. This outburst of social media data has led to an extensive amount of research for analyzing and extracting useful knowledge and workable patterns from social media data (Hussain & Cambria, 2018). Among those, however, the academic interest in social media marketing and financial forecasting has only increased in recent years (Xing, Cambria, & Welsch, 2018b). For example, only one special issue (Hajli & Laroche, 2019) and two workshops (Chen, Huang, Takamura, Chen, Hahn, Hoste, & Tsai (2018).) have been organized on these two topics, respectively.Social media marketing aims to communicate with potential customers to build brand\u00a0\u2026", "The scenario when investors need to manage a large number of financial assets has an essential difference from what most of the people do for stock movement prediction today. Unlike the situation of considering a single stock, investors need to consider co-movement of related stocks and control risk within a certain level. In traditional asset allocation models, expected returns and correlations of financial assets are difficult to estimate from historical price series, which are nonstationary and volatile. Therefore, we resort to textual knowledge hidden behind the huge amount of unstructured market information produced by human beings.

Today, that much information is created weekly. The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public about social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in social media marketing and financial forecast. Keeping up with the ever-growing amount of unstructured information on the Web, however, is a formidable task. Unlike standard statistical approaches, sentic computing relies on a vector space model of affective common-sense knowledge to work with natural language at conceptlevel. The well-known noisiness of common-sense data sources, however, is a major factor in jeopardizing the efficiency of analogical reasoning in the vector space. In this work, it is explored how least absolute deviations can aid semantic outlier detection and, hence, enhance concept-level opinion mining.", "Synergistic activation of muscles are considered to be the phenomenon by which the central nervous system simplifies its control strategy.

We contrast performance of the decoder while using time domain and synergy features. The decoder is trained using extreme learning machine algorithm, and online testing is performed in a virtual environment. Better classification accuracy for online control is obtained while using muscle synergy features.

Unlike real world social networks, however, online social groups tend to form for extremely varied and multi-faceted reasons. This makes very difficult to group members of the same social network in subsets in a way that certain types of contents are shared with just certain types of friends. Moreover, such a task is usually too tedious to be performed manually and too complex to be performed automatically. In this work, we propose a new approach for automatically clustering social networks, which exploits interaction semantics and sentics, that is, the conceptual and affective information associated with the interactive behavior of online social network members.", "Online communication is one of the key value propositions of mobile devices. While a variety of instant messaging clients offer users the ability to communicate with other users in real-time, the user experience remains dominated by a basic exchange of textual content. When compared to face-to-face communication, this experience is significantly poorer. In our proposed solution, we seek to enhance the chat experience by using an intelligent adaptive user interface that exploits semantics and sentics, that is the cognitive and affective information, associated with the ongoing communication. In particular, our approach leverages sentiment analysis techniques to process communication content and context and, hence, enable the interface to be adaptive in order to offer users a richer and more immersive chat experience.", "The paper addresses some roles of concept-based representations in document clustering to support knowledge discovery.

Metaphors do not take their literal meanings in contexts, which may cause obstacles for language learners to understand them. Metaphoric expressions also reflect the cognition of humans via concept mappings, attracting great attention from cognitive science and psychology communities. Thus, we aim to develop a computational metaphor processing online system, termed MetaPro Online, that allows users without a coding background, eg, language learners and linguists, to easily query metaphoricity labels, metaphor paraphrases, and concept mappings for non-domain-specific text. The outputs of MetaPro can be directly used by language learners and natural language processing downstream tasks because MetaPro is an end-to-end system.", "Combining symbolic and subsymbolic methods has become a promising strategy as research tasks in AI grow increasingly complicated and require higher levels of understanding.

To recognize the medical concept and assign their category, we employ our previously developed WordNet of Medical Event (WME 2.0) domain-specific lexicon. The lexicon provides medical concepts and their affinity, gravity, polarity scores, similar sentiment words, and sentiment features, help to develop the category assignment system.

In the era of social colonisation, people are getting more and more enthusiastic about interacting, sharing and collaborating through social networks, online communities, blogs, wikis and other online collaborative media. In recent years, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas in the web, with particular focus on fields related to our everyday life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. To overcome such obstacle, we need to explore more concept-level approaches that rely more on the implicit semantic texture of natural language, rather than its explicit syntactic structure.

It has aroused much interest in evaluating the specific reasoning capability of LLMs, such as multilingual reasoning and mathematical reasoning. However, as one of the key reasoning perspectives, logical reasoning capability has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we aim to bridge those gaps and provide comprehensive evaluations. Firstly, to offer systematic evaluations, this paper selects fifteen typical logical reasoning datasets and organizes them into deductive, inductive, abductive and mixed-form reasoning settings. Considering the comprehensiveness of evaluations, we include three representative LLMs (i.e., text-davinci-003, ChatGPT and BARD) and evaluate them on all selected datasets under zero-shot, one-shot and three-shot settings. Secondly, different from previous evaluations relying only on simple metrics (e.g., accuracy), we propose fine-level evaluations from objective and subjective manners, covering both answers and explanations. Also, to uncover the logical flaws of LLMs, bad cases will be attributed to five error types from two dimensions. Thirdly, to avoid the influences of knowledge bias and purely focus on benchmarking the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a new dataset with neutral content. It contains 3K samples and covers deductive, inductive and abductive reasoning settings.

It is classified into two categories depending on the resolved objects, namely entity coreference resolution and event coreference resolution. Predicting coreference connections and identifying mentions/triggers are the major challenges in coreference resolution, because these implicit relationships are particularly difficult in natural language understanding in downstream tasks. Coreference resolution techniques have experienced considerable advances in recent years, encouraging us to review this task in the following aspects: current employed evaluation metrics, datasets, and methods.

The consecutive crises led to the rise of different social movements in several countries, in which the political status quo changed. These changes included an increment of the different tensions underlying politics, as has been reported after many other political and economical crises during the twentieth century. This article proposes the study of the political discourse, and its underlying tension, during Madrid\u2019s elections (Spain) in May 2021 by using a mixed approach. To demonstrate if an aggressive tone is used during the campaign, a mixed methodology approach is applied: quantitative computational techniques, related to natural language processing, are used to conduct a first general analysis of the information screened; then, these methods are used for detecting specific trends that can be later filtered and analyzed\u00a0\u2026", "THE last two decades have witnessed an enormous amount of research works on sentiment analysis and significant progress has been made.

Previous biomedical knowledge extraction methods simply considered limited entity types and relations by using a task-specific training set, which is insufficient for large-scale BKGs development and downstream task applications in different scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose a joint continual learning biomedical information extraction (JCBIE) network to extract entities and relations from different biomedical information datasets. By empirically studying different joint learning and continual learning strategies, the proposed JCBIE can learn and expand different types of entities and relations from different datasets. JCBIE uses two separated encoders in joint-feature extraction, hence can effectively avoid the feature confusion problem comparing with using one hard-parameter sharing encoder. Specifically, it allows us to adopt entity augmented inputs to establish the interaction between named entity recognition and relation extraction. Finally, a novel evaluation mechanism is proposed for measuring cross-corpus generalization errors, which was ignored by traditional evaluation methods. Our empirical studies show that JCBIE achieves promising performance when continual learning strategy is adopted with multiple corpora.", "The impacts of climate change and global warming have become more visible globally because of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, abnormal heatwaves, and other climate crises. Besides the traditional survey method, it is beneficial to automatically distillate climate change opinions from social platforms to measure public reactions quickly.

The weakness of these models is their inability to interpret their results. Even if the model shows excellent performance over test data, it can sometimes fail in real-life tasks since it may incorrectly interpret a statement. To investigate this issue, we evaluate two approaches. In the first approach, we generate sentence embeddings by training a siamese BiLSTM with max-pooling on the psychological statement pairs to compute the semantic similarities between them. In the second approach, we evaluate state-of-the-art pretrained language models to see whether their output representations can distinguish personality types.

In traditional domain generalization systems, multiple source domains are used to generalize to a single target domain. However, we tackle the scenario where examples of sentiments from only one domain are available. Recent works have proposed to generate target domain examples from a single source domain by means of an adversarial training, ensuring that generated examples performs well on classifier trained on source domain. However, the inherent assumption is that domain shift is only due to covariate shift. In our work, we argue that, in realistic scenarios such as sentiment analysis, there is significant change in label distribution across domains as well. Subsequently, we propose a soft labeling formulation that provides better generalization and more robust classifiers across unseen sentiment domains.

Besides verbal communication, in fact, humans interact also through many other channels, e.g., facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, posture, and voice tone.

In the past research of inductive reasoning within computer science, logic language is used as representations of knowledge (facts and rules, more specifically). However, logic language can cause systematic problems for inductive reasoning such as disability of handling raw input such as natural language, sensitiveness to mislabeled data, and incapacity to handle ambiguous input. To this end, we propose a new task, which is to induce natural language rules from natural language facts, and create a dataset termed DEER containing 1.2k rule-fact pairs for the task, where rules and facts are written in natural language. New automatic metrics are also proposed and analysed for the evaluation of this task. With DEER, we investigate a modern approach for inductive reasoning where we use natural language as representation for knowledge instead of logic language and use pretrained language models as ''reasoners''. Moreover, we provide the first and comprehensive analysis of how well pretrained language models can induce natural language rules from natural language facts. We also propose a new framework drawing insights from philosophy literature for this task, which we show in the experiment section that surpasses baselines in both automatic and human evaluations.", "In cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER), self-training is commonly used to bridge the linguistic gap by training on pseudo-labeled target-language data. However, due to sub-optimal performance on target languages, the pseudo labels are often noisy and limit the overall performance. In this work, we aim to improve self-training for cross-lingual NER by combining representation learning and pseudo label refinement in one coherent framework. Our proposed method, namely ContProto mainly comprises two components: (1) contrastive self-training and (2) prototype-based pseudo-labeling. Our contrastive self-training facilitates span classification by separating clusters of different classes, and enhances cross-lingual transferability by producing closely-aligned representations between the source and target language. Meanwhile, prototype-based pseudo-labeling effectively improves the accuracy of pseudo labels during training. We evaluate ContProto on multiple transfer pairs, and experimental results show our method brings in substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods.", "This paper presents a novel approach for explainability in financial analysis by utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient to establish a relationship between aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices. The proposed methodology involves constructing an aspect list from financial news articles and analyzing sentiment intensity scores for each aspect.

The results indicate that the proposed approach provides a more detailed and accurate understanding of the relationship between sentiment analysis and stock prices, which can be useful for investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions. Additionally, this methodology offers a transparent and interpretable way to explain the sentiment analysis results and their impact on stock prices. Overall, the findings of this paper demonstrate the importance of explainability in financial analysis and highlight the potential benefits of utilizing the Pearson coefficient for analyzing aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices. The proposed approach offers a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationships between financial news sentiment and stock prices, providing a new perspective on the financial market and aiding in making informed investment decisions.", "Sarcasm is a form of communication often used to express contempt or ridicule, where the speaker conveys a message opposite to their true meaning, typically intending to mock or belittle a specific target. Sarcasm detection has gained great attention in the field of natural language processing due to the fact that sarcasm is widespread on social media and difficult to detect for machines. While early efforts in sarcasm detection solely relied on textual data, the abundance of multimodal data on social media is also non-negligible. Recent research has focused on multimodal sarcasm detection, where attention mechanisms and graph neural networks were commonly used to identify relevant information in both image and text data.

Moreover, researchers adopted traditional machine learning and deep learning models to capture emotions from the text. Recently, transformers-based architectures achieve better results in various natural language processing tasks. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based emotion detection system, which uses context-dependent features and a one-cycle learning rate policy for a better understanding of emotions from the text.

To this end, the ensemble application of sentic computing and intention awareness techniques is hereby examined to develop a novel analysis framework for estimating the effects of diplomatic, informational, military, health, and economic activities in the context of a theater of operations. A set of candidate models of the flow and evolution of population beliefs and intentions is evaluated and recommended as the starting point for developing an effects modeling system for tactical commanders. In particular, the following needs were identified:(1) understanding and representing the underlying causality within the population;(2) formulating models that are both sensitive and computable;(3) validating the predictions of population beliefs, intentions, and behaviors by model.", "Semantic processing is a fundamental research domain in computational linguistics. In the era of powerful pre-trained language models and large language models, the advancement of research in this domain appears to be decelerating. However, the study of semantics is multi-dimensional in linguistics. The research depth and breadth of computational semantic processing can be largely improved with new technologies. In this survey, we analyzed five semantic processing tasks, e.g., word sense disambiguation, anaphora resolution, named entity recognition, concept extraction, and subjectivity detection. We study relevant theoretical research in these fields, advanced methods, and downstream applications. We connect the surveyed tasks with downstream applications because this may inspire future scholars to fuse these low-level semantic processing tasks with high-level natural language processing tasks\u00a0\u2026", "With the rise of foundation models, a new artificial intelligence paradigm has emerged, by simply using general purpose foundation models with prompting to solve problems instead of training a separate machine learning model for each problem. Such models have been shown to have emergent properties of solving problems that they were not initially trained on. The studies for the effectiveness of such models are still quite limited. In this work, we widely study the capabilities of the ChatGPT models, namely GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, on 13 affective computing problems, namely aspect extraction, aspect polarity classification, opinion extraction, sentiment analysis, sentiment intensity ranking, emotions intensity ranking, suicide tendency detection, toxicity detection, well-being assessment, engagement measurement, personality assessment, sarcasm detection, and subjectivity detection. We introduce a framework to evaluate the ChatGPT models on regression-based problems, such as intensity ranking problems, by modelling them as pairwise ranking classification. We compare ChatGPT against more traditional NLP methods, such as end-to-end recurrent neural networks and transformers. The results demonstrate the emergent abilities of the ChatGPT models on a wide range of affective computing problems, where GPT-3.5 and especially GPT-4 have shown strong performance on many problems, particularly the ones related to sentiment, emotions, or toxicity. The ChatGPT models fell short for problems with implicit signals, such as engagement measurement and subjectivity detection.", "Logical reasoning is central to human cognition and intelligence. Past research of logical reasoning within AI uses formal language as knowledge representation~(and symbolic reasoners). However, reasoning with formal language has proved challenging~(e.g., brittleness and knowledge-acquisition bottleneck). This paper provides a comprehensive overview on a new paradigm of logical reasoning, which uses natural language as knowledge representation~(and pretrained language models as reasoners), including philosophical definition and categorization of logical reasoning, advantages of the new paradigm, benchmarks and methods, challenges of the new paradigm, desirable tasks & methods in the future, and relation to related NLP fields. This new paradigm is promising since it not only alleviates many challenges of formal representation but also has advantages over end-to-end neural methods.", "The MuSe 2023 is a set of shared tasks addressing three different contemporary multimodal affect and sentiment analysis problems: In the Mimicked Emotions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Mimic), participants predict three continuous emotion targets. This sub-challenge utilises the Hume-Vidmimic dataset comprising of user-generated videos. For the Cross-Cultural Humour Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humour), an extension of the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset is provided. Participants predict the presence of spontaneous humour in a cross-cultural setting. The Personalisation Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Personalisation) is based on the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset, featuring recordings of subjects in a stressed situation. Here, arousal and valence signals are to be predicted, whereas parts of the test labels are made available in order to facilitate personalisation. MuSe 2023 seeks to bring together a broad audience from different research communities such as audio-visual emotion recognition, natural language processing, signal processing, and health informatics. In this baseline paper, we introduce the datasets, sub-challenges, and provided feature sets. As a competitive baseline system, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is employed. On the respective sub-challenges' test datasets, it achieves a mean (across three continuous intensity targets) Pearson's Correlation Coefficient of .4727 for MuSe-Mimic, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of .8310 for MuSe-Humor and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) values of .7482 for arousal and .7827 for\u00a0\u2026", "Time information plays an important role in the areas of data mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing.

Researchers from these areas have devoted considerable effort in the last two decades to define the problem of time expression analysis, design the standards for time expression annotation, build annotated corpora for time expressions, and develop methods to identify time expressions from free text. While there are some surveys concerned with the development of time information extraction, retrieval, and reasoning, to the best of our knowledge, there is no survey focusing on the TERN development.

Benefiting from powerful feature extraction capabilities, graph representation learning can capture complex relationships and achieve promising performance in many clinical prediction tasks. However, existing works either exclusively consider single domain knowledge with an independent task or do not fully capitalize on domain knowledge that can provide more predictive signals in the code encoding stage. Moreover, the heterogeneous and high-dimensional nature of EHR data leads to a deficiency of hardly encoding implicit high-order correlations.

It is an important part of modern natural language processing and semantic cognition as these implicit relationships are particularly difficult in natural language understanding in downstream tasks. Mention identification and mention linking are the two sub-tasks in the general co-reference resolution research community. Gold-two-mention style co-reference resolution is a special type of co-reference resolution that focuses on linking the ambiguous pronoun to one of the two candidate antecedents. In this paper, we proposed a joint learning model that learns mention identification and mention linking tasks together, because we find that the learning of mention identification can provide supportive dependent information for the learning of mention linking.

Building a heatmap based on the importance value of input features is a popular method for explaining the underlying functions of such models in producing their predictions. Heatmaps are almost understandable to humans, yet they are not without flaws. Non-expert users, for example, may not fully understand the logic of heatmaps (the logic in which relevant pixels to the model's prediction are highlighted with different intensities or colors). Additionally, objects and regions of the input image that are relevant to the model prediction are frequently not entirely differentiated by heatmaps. In this paper, we propose a framework called TbExplain that employs XAI techniques and a pre-trained object detector to present text-based explanations of scene classification models. Moreover, TbExplain incorporates a novel method to correct predictions and textually explain them based on the statistics of objects in the input image when the initial prediction is unreliable. To assess the trustworthiness and validity of the text-based explanations, we conducted a qualitative experiment, and the findings indicated that these explanations are sufficiently reliable. Furthermore, our quantitative and qualitative experiments on TbExplain with scene classification datasets reveal an improvement in classification accuracy over ResNet variants.", "Video conferencing has enabled synchronous communication in a classroom and created multi-sensory content to stimulate learners. Artificial intelligence involves complex equations that are better taught using a constructive pedagogy where students experiment with alternative ways of solving the same problem. Multiple-choice questions have high reliability and can easily reveal student skill levels in a quick way. The Australian Computer Society accreditation exercise ensures that the content for each subject serves as a flexible template for teaching. The geographical extent of the country requires the presence of multiple subordinate campuses affiliated to a main campus. Following the concept of strands, it was also necessary to show continuity in learning and assessments between the first- and second-year subjects. Student feedback for subjects with artificial intelligence-based simulations showed that several students found it difficult to understand lectures and assignments. Hence, to measure student learning, we introduced a Kahoot quiz during the recess of each lecture that students could join through their mobile phones from different campuses. Software project management is challenging for students with vision or attention-related disorders. We taught them how to use charts to visually observe variables and narrow down possible relationships before performing in-depth analysis. One of the main purposes of education is employability. Hence, greater context to real world industry examples was introduced into lectures.", "Pretrained language models have been shown to store knowledge in their parameters and have achieved reasonable performance in commonsense knowledge base completion (CKBC) tasks. However, CKBC is knowledge-intensive and it is reported that pretrained language models\u2019 performance in knowledge-intensive tasks are limited because of their incapability of accessing and manipulating knowledge. As a result, we hypothesize that providing retrieved passages that contain relevant knowledge as additional input to the CKBC task will improve performance. In particular, we draw insights from Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)\u2013which aims to solve a new problem by reasoning with retrieved relevant cases, and investigate the direct application of it to CKBC. On two benchmark datasets, we demonstrate through automatic and human evaluations that our End-to-end Case-Based Reasoning Framework (ECBRF) generates more valid, informative, and novel knowledge than the state-of-the-art COMET model for CKBC in both the fully supervised and few-shot settings. We provide insights on why previous retrieval-based methods only achieve merely the same performance with COMET. From the perspective of CBR, our framework addresses a fundamental question on whether CBR methodology can be utilized to improve deep learning models.", "To date, most of the existing open-domain question answering (QA) methods focus on  explicit  questions where the reasoning steps are mentioned  explicitly  in the question. In this article, we study  implicit  QA where the reasoning steps are not evident in the question. Implicit QA is challenging in two aspects. First, evidence retrieval is difficult since there is little overlap between a question and its required evidence. Second, answer inference is difficult since the reasoning strategy is latent in the question. To tackle implicit QA, we propose a systematic solution denoted as DisentangledQA, which disentangles topic, attribute, and reasoning strategy from the implicit question to guide the retrieval and reasoning. Specifically, we disentangle the topic and attribute information from the implicit question to guide evidence retrieval. For answer reasoning, we propose a disentangled reasoning model for answer prediction\u00a0\u2026", "Protection of human rights is one of the most important problems of our world.

We labeled the dataset by monitoring most trending news topics from global and local newspapers. Apart from that, we present two baselines, TF-IDF and LDA.

While the effect of sentiment is complex and time-varying for traditional financial assets, its role in cryptocurrency markets is unclear. This research explores the predictive power of public sentiment on Bitcoin trading volume. We develop a novel sentiment analysis pipeline for processing Bitcoin-related tweets and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on a benchmark dataset. Our pipeline also leverages information gain theory to incorporate the impact of textual and non-textual features. We use such features to discern a nonlinear relationship between public sentiment and Bitcoin trading volume and discover the optimal predictive horizon for Bitcoin.

But manual analysis of related user-generated contents on social media platforms is a daunting task, and automatic data analysis and visualization come to help. So, in this research, we firstly developed a model for classifying the emotion of nuclear energy related tweets and another model for the aspect-based sentiment analysis of nuclear energy tweets using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). After that, we developed a prototype system for visualization of the analyzed results stored in the database. The user interface dashboards of the system allow users to monitor emotion and sentiment trends towards nuclear energy by analyzing recent nuclear energy tweets crawled weekly.", "Embodiments of the present invention may provide techniques to create a new framework by this invention applying the theory of Sentic Computing.

Mining this \u2018coal\u2019 from the ever-growing Social Web, however, can be a formidable task. In this work, we address this problem in the context of sentiment analysis using convolutional online adaptation learning (COAL). In particular, we consider semi-supervised learning of convolutional features, which we use to train an online model. Such a model, which can be trained in one domain but also used to predict sentiment in other domains, outperforms the baseline in the range of 5-20%.", "Non-iterative methods for parameter estimation for interval type-2 neuro-fuzzy structure are fast to implement, when compared to online methods, and need no -or a few- parameters to be tuned. In this paper, a novel dynamic cost function, which defines a relationship between the current and past errors, is defined. The minimization of the aforementioned cost function results in a decreasing sequence of error which makes the proposed method numerically more stable when compared to least squares-based methods. It is a well-known phenomenon that a matrix inversion may cause problems if the matrix to be inverted is ill-defined i.e. its condition number is far bigger than one. The use of a dynamic relationship between the current and past error adds more degrees of freedom which makes it possible to improve the condition number of the matrix.

In particular, we focus on the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis, which consists in the simultaneous analysis of different modali- ties, e.g., speech and video, for emotion and polarity detection. Our approach takes advantages of the massively parallel processing power of modern GPUs to enhance the performance of feature extraction from different modalities. In addition, in order to ex- tract important textual features from multimodal sources we generate domain-specific graphs based on commonsense knowledge and apply GPU-based graph traversal for fast feature detection. Then, powerful ELM classifiers are applied to build the senti- ment analysis model based on the extracted features.

Sentiment Analysis engines implement approaches spanning from lexicon-based techniques, to machine learning, or involving syntactical rules analysis. Such systems are already evaluated in international research challenges. However, Semantic Sentiment Analysis approaches, which take into account or rely also on large semantic knowledge bases and implement Semantic Web best practices, are not under specific experimental evaluation and comparison by other international challenges. Such approaches may potentially deliver higher performance, since they are also able to analyze the implicit, semantics features associated with natural language concepts.

There is a need to pinpoint such posts and learn the kind of response expected. For this purpose, we understand the sentiment that a personal story elicits on different posts present on different social media sites, on the topics of abuse or mental health. In this paper, we propose a method supported by hand-crafted features to judge if the post requires an empathetic response. The model is trained upon posts from various web-pages and corresponding comments, on both the captions and the images. We were able to obtain 80% accuracy in tagging posts requiring empathetic responses.", "Since proposed, LDA have been successfully used in modeling text documents. So far, words are the common features to induce latent topic, which are later used in document representation. Observation on documents indicates that the polysemous words can make the latent topics less discriminative, resulting in less accurate document representation. We thus argue that the semantically deterministic word senses can improve quality of the latent topics. In this work, we proposes a series of word sense aware LDA models which use word sense as an extra latent variable in topic induction. Preliminary experiments on document clustering on benchmark datasets show that word sense can indeed improve topic modeling.", "In human cognition, the capacity to reason and make decisions is strictly dependent on our common sense knowledge about the world and our inner emotional states: we call this ability affective common sense reasoning. In previous works, graph mining and multi-dimensionality reduction techniques have been employed in attempt to emulate such a process and, hence, to semantically and affectively analyze natural language text. In this work, we exploit a novel cognitive model based on the combined use of principal component analysis and artificial neural networks to perform reasoning on a knowledge base obtained by merging a graph representation of common sense with a linguistic resource for the lexical representation of affect.

To this end, we propose a novel prompt-based contrastive learning method for few-shot NER without template construction and label word mappings. First, we leverage external knowledge to initialize semantic anchors for each entity type. These anchors are simply appended with input sentence embeddings as template-free prompts (TFPs). Then, the prompts and sentence embeddings are in-context optimized with our proposed semantic-enhanced contrastive loss.

Furthermore, prior research has primarily focused on improving classification accuracy, yet it has given less attention to achieving interpretable, precise scene classification. Therefore, we are motivated to propose EnTri, an ensemble scene recognition framework that employs ensemble learning using a hierarchy of visual features. EnTri represents features at three distinct levels of detail: pixel-level, semantic segmentation-level, and object class and frequency level. By incorporating distinct feature encoding schemes of differing complexity and leveraging ensemble strategies, our approach aims to improve classification accuracy while enhancing transparency and interpretability via visual and textual explanations. To achieve interpretability, we devised an extension algorithm that generates both visual and textual explanations highlighting various properties of a given scene that contribute to the final prediction of its category. This includes information about objects, statistics, spatial layout, and textural details. Through experiments on benchmark scene classification datasets, EnTri has demonstrated superiority in terms of recognition accuracy, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with an accuracy of 87.69%, 75.56%, and 99.17% on the MIT67, SUN397, and UIUC8 datasets, respectively.", "A growing amount of research use pre\u2010trained language models to address few/zero\u2010shot text classification problems.

In addition, how this approach can improve performance when the data resources are scarce like in the Arabic language and the input text is short with little semantic information as is the case using tweets.

This paper studies metric-based distillation to align the embedding space of text and speech with only a small amount of data without modifying the model structure. Since the semantic and granularity gap between text and speech has been omitted in literature, which impairs the distillation, we propose the Prior-informed Adaptive knowledge Distillation (PAD) that adaptively leverages text/speech units of variable granularity and prior distributions to achieve better global and local alignments between text and speech pre\u00a0\u2026", "Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has wide applications in medical care, human-computer interaction, and other fields. Unlike the general task of emotion analysis, humans usually rely on context and commonsense knowledge to convey emotions in conversations.

Unfortunately, there is no available knowledge selection mechanism to address such knowledge needs and to make sure the system is not flooded with irrelevant commonsense knowledge.

The speaker usually begins with an intention and motivation of what is to be communicated, and what effects are expected from the communication, while taking into consideration the listener's mental model to concoct an appropriate sentence. The listener likewise has to interpret what the speaker means, and respond accordingly, also with the speaker's mental state in mind. To do this successfully, conceptual, motivational, and affective processes have to be represented appropriately to drive the language generation and understanding processes. Language processing has succeeded well with the big data approach in applications such as chatbots and machine translation. However, in human-robot collaborative social communication and in using natural language for delivering precise instructions to robots, a deeper representation of the conceptual, motivational, and affective processes is needed. This paper capitalizes on the UGALRS (Unified General Autonomous and Language Reasoning System) framework and the CD+ (Conceptual Representation Plus) representational scheme to illustrate how social communication through language is supported by a knowledge representational scheme that handles conceptual, motivational, and affective processes in a deep and general way.

In this paper, we target both these challenges by using an adversarial model that can segment a face from the background scenery and occlusions. The segmentation for a fake video will be of poor quality compared to a real video. Previous segmentation models could only be trained on a few objects and failed on scenic images with occlusions.

We analyze two benchmark datasets for the characteristics of named entities, finding that uncommon words can distinguish named entities from common text; where uncommon words are the words that hardly appear in common text and they are mainly the proper nouns. Experiments validate that lexical and syntactic features achieve state-of-the-art performance on entity extraction and that semantic features do not further improve the extraction performance, in both of our model and the state-of-the-art baselines.

TOMN defines a constituent-based tagging scheme named TOMN scheme with four tags, namely T, O, M, and N, indicating the constituents of time expression, namely Time token, Modifier, Numeral, and the words Outside time expression. In modeling, TOMN assigns a word with a TOMN tag under conditional random fields with minimal features. Essentially, our constituent-based TOMN scheme overcomes the problem of inconsistent tag assignment that is caused by the conventional position-based tagging schemes (e.g., BIO scheme and BILOU scheme). Evaluation shows that TOMN is equally or more effective than state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, and much more robust on cross-datasets.", "We analyze four diverse datasets about time expressions for their intrinsic characteristics and find five such common characteristics; similarly we analyze two well-known benchmark datasets about named entities for their intrinsic characteristics and find three such common characteristics.

Recently, spatio-temporal graphs received a reasonable amount of attention from the research community since they emerged as a natural representational tool able to capture the interactive and interrelated structure of a complex problem. To better understand the nature of complex systems, there is the need to define models that can easily explain the learned causal relationship. To this end, we propose an attentive model able to learn and project the relational structure into a fixed-size embedding. Such representation naturally captures the dynamic influence that each neighbors exert over a given vertex providing a valuable description of the problem setting.

Raw web corpora that are necessary for developing hypotheses in the published papers are also collected in the dataset, with the final goal of creating a system that automatically generates valid, novel, and helpful (to human researchers) hypotheses, given only a pile of raw web corpora. The new dataset can tackle the previous problems because it requires to (1) use raw web corpora as observations; and (2) propose hypotheses even new to humanity.

This survey outlines the capabilities of the currently developed LLMs for Healthcare and explicates their development process, with the aim of providing an overview of the development roadmap from traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to LLMs. Specifically, we first explore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of various Healthcare applications highlighting both the strengths and limitations. Secondly, we conduct a comparison between the previous PLMs and the latest LLMs, as well as comparing various LLMs with each other.

Therefore, to construct the adversarial samples with few pixels perturbed in an end-to-end way, we propose a new framework, in which a dual-decoder VAE for perturbations finding is designed. To make adversarial learning more effective, we proposed a new version of the adversarial loss by considering the generalization.

Specifically, the heads of MHA were originally designed to attend to information from different representation subspaces, whereas prior studies found that some attention heads likely learn similar features and can be pruned without harming performance. Inspired by the minimum-redundancy feature selection, we assume that focusing on the most representative and distinctive features with minimum resources can mitigate the above issues and lead to more effective and efficient MHAs. In particular, we propose Grouped Head Attention, trained with a self-supervised group constraint that group attention heads, where each group focuses on an essential but distinctive feature subset.

Metaphor identification and interpretation are two major tasks in this domain. Although metaphor identification has been widely studied, the development of metaphor interpretation techniques is much slower. This is likely because of the lack of large annotated datasets and effective pre-trained language models (PLMs) that can support the learning of metaphor interpretation. Thus, we propose a dataset with over 10,000 sequences with token-level metaphor paraphrases and a metaphor processing-oriented PLM with a novel anomalous language modeling (ALM) method.
