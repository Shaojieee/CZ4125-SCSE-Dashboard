Big volumes of various GPS-based travel data can be easily collected, among which the taxi GPS trajectory data is a typical example. However, in GPS trajectory data, there is usually little information on travelers' activities, thereby they can only support limited applications. Quite a few studies have been focused on enriching the semantic meaning for raw data, such as travel mode/purpose inferring. Unfortunately, trip purpose imputation receives relatively less attention and requires no real-time response. To narrow the gap, we propose a probabilistic two-phase framework named TripImputor, for making the real-time taxi trip purpose imputation and recommending services to passengers at their dropoff points.

However, existing NVM-based filesystems cannot adapt well for mobile devices, and not to mention the consideration for mobile application characteristics. In this paper, we propose an efficient and durable in-memory file system named as Mobi-PMFS for mobile devices. Proposed Mobi-PMFS is not only adaptive to ARM architecture, but also customized according to mobile application features. A wear-aware three-list space management scheme including a switching allocation algorithm is proposed to provide optimum performance for mobile systems while keeping the durability of NVM. Experimental results show that Mobi-PMFS is 8x times and 1.2x faster than EXT4-SSD and EXT4-DAX, and provides 11x wear-leveling improvement compared\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2020, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=UozjxW8AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=UozjxW8AAAAJ:327GGIiaIgIC", "title": "Work-in-Progress: Response Time Bounds for Typed DAG Parallel Tasks on Heterogeneous Multi-cores", "authors": ["Meiling Han", "Nan Guan", "Jinghao Sun", "Qingqiang He", "Qingxu Deng", "Weichen Liu"], "description": "Heterogenerous multi-cores utilize the strength of different architectures for executing particular types of workload, and usually offer higher performance and energy efficiency. In this paper, we study the worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis of typed scheduling of parallel DAG tasks on heterogeneous multi-cores, where the workload of each vertex in the DAG is only allowed to execute on a particular type of cores. The only known WCRT bound for this problem is grossly pessimistic and suffers the non-self-sustainability problem. In this paper, we propose two new WCRT bounds. The first new bound has the same time complexity as the existing bound, but is more precise and solves its non-self-sustainability problem. The second new bound explores more detailed task graph structure information to greatly improve the precision, but is computationally more expensive.

In order to achieve communication optimization with guaranteed thermal reliability, we employ local thermal tuning at the device level to guarantee system reliability, and further propose two routing approaches that include a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based approach and a contention-aware routing (CAR) heuristic for the thermal-reliable ONoCs.
