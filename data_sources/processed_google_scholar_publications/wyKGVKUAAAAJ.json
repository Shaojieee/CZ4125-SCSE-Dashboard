The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research.

Inspired by topic model, the underlying topic of a document set can also be viewed as a collection of different subtopics of different importance.

The learning objective is to minimize the distance between the representations learned from the two views. The contextual information is encoded through a hierarchical RNN architecture. Sentence salience is estimated in a hierarchical way with subtopic salience and relative sentence salience, by considering the contextual information.

Rather than modeling item representations as fixed vectors, we represent them as distributions in DiffuRec, which reflect user's multiple interests and item's various aspects adaptively. In diffusion phase, DiffuRec corrupts the target item embedding into a Gaussian distribution via noise adding, which is further applied for sequential item distribution representation generation and uncertainty injection. Afterwards, the item representation is fed into an Approximator for target item representation reconstruction.

Each ticket is assigned to a support engineer for processing. Due to the limited expertise of individuals, resolving a ticket may involve routing the ticket among multiple groups of engineers. Each routing step costs time and resources. It is desirable for experts to route a ticket to its most likely resolver with minimum steps. Automated or semi-automated systems are proposed to improve routing efficiency. To evaluate the performance of any system, including human routing, two metrics are commonly used, namely Mean Steps to Resolver (MSTR) and Resolution Rate (RR).

However, our study addresses both subproblems jointly using an end-to-end modeling approach. We first performed a preliminary analysis of half a million archived tickets to uncover relevant features.

Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis reveals that this superior performance can largely be attributed to the features that capture the associations between ticket assignment and group assignment.

The opinion is expressed by comparing multiple targets on a shared aspect, eg,\u201ccamera A is better than camera B in picture quality\u201d. Among the various subtasks in opinion mining, comparative opinion classification is relatively less studied. Current solutions use rules or classifiers to identify opinions, ie, better, worse, or same, through feature engineering. Because the features are directly derived from the input sentence, these solutions are sensitive to the order of the targets mentioned in the sentence. For example,\u201ccamera A is better than camera B\u201d means the same as \u201ccamera B is worse than camera A\u201d; but the features of these two sentences are completely different. In this paper, we approach comparative opinion classification through prompt learning, taking the advantage of embedded knowledge in pre-trained language model.

When researchers label studies, they can screen ranked documents where relevant documents are higher than irrelevant ones. This practice, known as screening prioritization (ie., document ranking approach), speeds up the process of conducting a SR as the documents labelled as relevant can move to the next tasks earlier.

Towards reducing the manual workload in the screening process, we investigate the quality of document ranking of SR. This can signal researchers whereabouts in the ranking relevant studies are located and let them decide where to stop the screening. After extensive analysis on SR document rankings from different ranking models, we hypothesize 'topic broadness' as a factor that affects the ranking quality of SR.

We make a few main findings from our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user interactions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens platform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affect the subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by the candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal recommendation algorithm(s). Removal of interactions that happen nearer to the last few interactions of a user leads to increasing difficulty in learning user preference, thus deteriorating recommendation accuracy. Third, changing the order of user interactions makes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive interaction process. Based on these findings, we further discuss the discrepancy between the interaction generation mechanism that is employed by the MovieLens system and that of typical real world recommendation scenarios. In summary, models that achieve excellent recommendation accuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in practice for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2023, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wyKGVKUAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=wyKGVKUAAAAJ:UO8fSLLLPykC", "title": "Research Explosion: More Effort to Climb onto Shoulders of the Giant", "authors": ["Guoxiu He", "Aixin Sun", "Wei Lu"], "description": "Fast-growing scientific publications present challenges to the scientific community.

The results demonstrate that recent papers contain more references than older ones, especially the well-cited papers compared with other papers. Well-cited papers receive 10 or more citations within 5 years of publication. Their references cover a longer period from classic research to very recent studies. Authors of well-cited papers are also farsighted to discover the reference papers with good potential to receive high citation numbers in near future. We also discover that the number of accumulative publications has a negative impact on next-5-year citation count for most fields except Chemistry, Materials science, Environmental science, Biology, and Engineering. Our findings suggest that researchers are expected to devote more effort to producing impactful research.

Some other interactions are indications of recent trends in user preference changes or marketing positions of new items. Accordingly, the recommender needs to be periodically retrained or updated to capture the new trends, and yet not to forget the long-term preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic retraining framework called Disentangled Incremental Learning (DIL) for graph-based recommenders. We assume that long-term preferences are well captured in the existing model, in the form of model parameters learned from past interactions. New preferences can be learned from the user-item bipartite graph constructed using the newly observed interactions. In DIL, we design an Information Extraction Module to extract historical preferences from the existing model. Then we blend the historical and new preferences in the form of node embeddings in the new graph, through a Disentanglement Module. The essence of the disentanglement module is to decorrelate the historical and new preferences so that both can be well captured, via carefully designed losses. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, we show the effectiveness of DIL in capturing dynamics of useritem interactions.

Detecting risky (or bad) sellers on such a payment network is crucial to payment service providers for risk management and legal compliance. In this research, we formulate this task as a node classification task. Specifically, we aim to predict a label for each seller in a payment network, by analysing its properties and/or interactions. Nodes residing in different parts of a payment network can have similar local topology structures. Such local topology structures reveal sellers' business roles, eg., supplier, drop-shipper, or retailer. We note that many existing solutions for graph-based node classification only consider node connectivity but not the similarity between node's local topology structure. Motivated by business need, we present a dual-path graph convolution network, named DP-GCN, for node classification. DP-GCN considers both node connectivity and topology structure similarity. The proposed model consists of three main modules: (i) a C-GCN module to capture connectivity relationships between nodes, (ii) a T-GCN module to capture topology structure similarities between nodes, and (iii) a multi-head self-attention module to align both properties.
