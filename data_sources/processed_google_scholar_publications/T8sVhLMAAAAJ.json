Training such huge data volumes using a centralized data center proves to be a challenging task, due to prohibitively heavy bandwidth costs, poor time efficiency, and high privacy leakages. These challenges have fueled the revolutionary shift of intelligence applications from a centralized data center to ubiquitous edges, denoted as edge intelligence.

Furthermore, a distributed computing network may include straggling nodes that run intermittently slower. This results in a longer overall time needed to execute the computation tasks, thereby limiting the performance of distributed computing. To address these issues, coded distributed computing (CDC), i.e., a combination of coding theoretic techniques and distributed computing, has been recently proposed as a promising solution.

Also, known as the WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access), IEEE 802.16 standard has been developed to provide broadband wireless access (BWA) with a flexible QoS framework. WiMAX networks can operate either on 10\u201366 or 2\u201311 GHz (IEEE 802.16 a) band and support data rate in the range of 32\u2013130 Mbps, depending on the bandwidth of operation as well as the modulation and coding schemes used. While in the 10\u201366GHz band (ie, with WirelessMAN-SC air interface), the signal propagation between a base station (BS) and a subscriber station (SS) or mobile must be line-of-sight, IEEE 802.16 a operating in the 2\u201311 GHz band supports nonline-of-sight communication. One of the air interfaces for 802.16 a, namely, WirelessMAN-OFDMA, is based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) where the entire bandwidth is divided into subchannels, which are dynamically allocated among the different connections.

The ER requests WPT by backscattering signals from an AS towards the ET, which then retrodirectively beamforms an energy signal towards the ER.

Network function virtualization (NFV) is referred to the deployment of software functions running on commodity servers instead of traditional hardware-based middle-boxes. It is an example of network softwarization. In NFV, a service is defined as a chain of software functions named service chain function (SFC). The process of allocating the resources of servers to the services, called service placement, is the most challenging mission in NFV. Dynamic nature of the service arrivals and departures as well as meeting the service level agreement make the service placement problem even more challenging.

Then, we formulate the dynamic reliability-aware service placement as an infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP), which aims to minimize the placement cost and maximize the number of admitted services. In the proposed MDP, the number of active services in the network is considered to be the state of the system, and the state of the idle resources is estimated based on it. Also, the number of possible admitted services is considered as the action of the presented MDP.

We apply a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze the participation level of the mobile users and the optimal incentive mechanism of the crowdsensing service provider using backward induction. In order to motivate the participants, the incentive is designed by taking into account the social network effects from the underlying mobile social domain. For example, in a crowdsensing-based road traffic information sharing application, a user can get a better and accurate traffic report if more users join and share their road information. We derive the analytical expressions for the discriminatory incentive as well as the uniform incentive mechanisms.

In this paper, we propose a free-space information sharing mechanism based on full-duplex device-to-device (D2D) semantic communications. Specifically, the view images of MR users in the same real-world scenario may be analogous. Therefore, when one user (i.e., a device) completes some computation tasks, the user can send his own calculation results and the semantic features extracted from the user's own view image to nearby users (i.e., other devices). On this basis, other users can use the received semantic features to obtain the spatial matching of the computational results under their own view images without repeating the computation. Using generalized small-scale fading models, we analyze the key performance indicators of full-duplex D2D communications, including channel capacity and bit error probability, which directly affect the transmission of semantic information.

They do not have an infrastructure such as a base station or an access point to facilitate data transfer.

Delay-tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a special kind of MANET that will allow mobile nodes to receive, store, and forward data when they move and meet each other. Unlike in MANETs, in DTNs, there is no need for an end-to-end path from the source to the destination when the data are transferred. Thus, DTNs are suitable for non-real-time traffic, namely delay-tolerant traffic. Typically, in MANETs and DTNs, the energy supply to the mobile nodes in the networks is limited and intermittent. Additionally, mobility makes data transfer less reliable than in infrastructure-based wireless networks such as cellular systems. Therefore, when one adopts wireless energy harvesting and transfer, some related issues, eg, routing and energy replenishment, have to be revisited.

The lack of sensor equipment resources hinders the traditional method of using mobile robots to move around the RoI to collect readings. Instead, our solution employs supervised neural networks to produce the values of the uncovered locations by extracting the non-linear relation among randomly deployed sensor nodes throughout the area. Moreover, we apply a hybrid backpropagation method to accelerate the learning convergence speed to a local minimum solution.

About 60%\u201480% originates from wireless base stations (BSs)[2]. As current cellular network architectures are designed to cope with peak load and degraded conditions, underutilization of them occurs most of the time. A recent study [3] shows that the average power-consumption of the traditional BS amounts to nearly 850 W, with only up to 40 W power consumed to transmit from the antennas and the rest wasted even during idle operation. This result indicates that there is much room for power savings in today\u2019s cellular networks. In this chapter, we consider the problem of power management for BSs with a renewable power source in a smart grid environment. In Section 10.2, we \ufb01rst provide an introduction to green wireless communications with the focus on two closely related research \ufb01elds, ie renewable power source and smart grid. Then, we provide an overview of the power-management approaches for BS, which consists of two major directions, ie BS power control and smart BS operation. The former is achieved at the equipment level, while the latter can be realized at the system/network level. Afterwards, we discuss some challenges and open issues with regard to power management for BS. In Section 10.3, we present the power-consumption model for a BS. Speci\ufb01cally, the power-consuming components are \ufb01rst introduced and analyzed.

In this game, it is shown that when the number of available scrambling codes is larger than or equal to the number of small cells, globally optimal and individually optimal PSC allocations always exist and coincide with the set of Nash equilibria. In the converse case, it is shown that an individually optimal PSC allocation might not exist. However, the existence of a global optimal allocation is always ensured. Here, the notion of individual optimality corresponds to the case in which small cells cannot reduce their probabilities of code confusion by changing their own PSC choices. On the other hand, the notion of global optimality refers to the case in which no other PSC allocation can reduce the probability of code confusion. The second contribution is a pair of algorithms based on the notion of trial and error learning that allow the achievability of an individually optimal PSC allocation, if it exists, or a globally optimal allocation otherwise. Both algorithms present attractive properties independently of the network topology and the ratio between the numbers of PSCs and active small cells in the network.", "publication_year": 2012, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:GUYAmugLYisC", "title": "Cooperative transmission for meter data collection in", "authors": ["Dusit Niyato", "Ping Wang"], "description": "Smart grid will become the next generation electrical power system to provide reliable, efficient, secure, and cost-effective energy generation, distribution, and consumption.

In this paper, we investigate a model of how to achieve an optimal use of energy-transfer from a mobile charger (MC) to sensor nodes (SN) harvested towards radio frequency. We adopt a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) as a simplified stochastic optimization to determine an energy policy with respects to energy transfer in both energy and data queues. We also propose a modified CMDP adopting linear programming approach (CMDP-Linear) to derive the optimal use to balance those factors. To validate our model, we evaluated the schemes with analysis and simulation for model justification purposes: first, in terms on energy, recharging, charging, and loss probabilities for MC; and second, the possibility of loss for SNs due to lacking of recharging from MC.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:MvIMIWP2nqIC", "title": "A Dynamic Edge Caching Framework for Mobile 5G Networks", "authors": ["Dinh Thai Hoang", "Dusit Niyato", "Diep Nguyen", "Eryk Dutkiewicz", "Ping Wang", "Zhu Han"], "description": "Mobile edge caching has emerged as a new paradigm to provide computing, networking resources, and storage for a variety of mobile applications. That helps achieve low latency, high reliability, and improve efficiency in handling a very large number of smart devices and emerging services (eg, IoT, industry automation, virtual reality) in mobile 5G networks. Nonetheless, the development of mobile edge caching is challenged by the decentralized nature of edge nodes, their small coverage, limited computing, and storage resources. In this article, we first give an overview of mobile edge caching in 5G networks. After that, its key challenges and current approaches are discussed. We then propose a novel caching framework. Our framework allows an edge node to authorize the legitimate users and dynamically predict and update their content demands using the matrix factorization technique. Based on the prediction, the edge node can adopt advanced optimization methods to determine optimal contents to store so as to maximize its revenue and minimize the average delay of its mobile users. Through numerical results, we demonstrate that our proposed framework provides not only an effective caching approach, but also an efficient economic solution for the mobile service provider.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:bFuYayV9R1gC", "title": "Conference Advisory Committees", "authors": ["John CS Lui", "Dusit Niyato", "Ke Wu", "Jianguo Ma", "Feifei Gao", "Sheng-Uei Guan", "Yutaka Ishibashi", "Yulin Wang", "Xiaohai He", "Bo Yan", "Yang Yang", "Bo Ai"], "description": "Provides a listing of current committee members and society officers.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:PQY3Tb_h0-cC", "title": "MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR THE PHYSICAL LAYER", "authors": ["Chunxiao Jiang", "Guoru Ding", "Aly El Gamal", "Andrea Zanella", "Oliver Holland", "Tim O\u2019Shea", "Shilian Zheng", "Shichuan Chen", "Xiaoniu Yang", "Peihan Qi", "Xiaoyu Zhou", "Zan Li", "Yun Lin", "Ya Tu", "Zheng Dou", "Lei Chen", "Shiwen Mao", "Liang Huang", "You Zhang", "Weijian Pan", "Jinyin Chen", "Li Ping Qian", "Yuan Wu", "Samer Hanna", "Samurdhi Karunaratne", "Danijela Cabric", "Zehui Xiong", "Yang Zhang", "Wei Yang Bryan Lim", "Jiawen Kang", "Dusit Niyato", "Cyril Leung", "Chunyan Miao", "Jiaxing Wang", "Rui Han", "Lin Bai", "Tao Zhang", "Jianwei Liu", "Jinho Choi", "Xin-Lin Huang", "Yu-Xuan Li", "Yu Gao", "Xiao-Wei Tang"], "description": "Presents the table of contents for this issue of the publication.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:M7C5BM2v8n8C", "title": "SPECIAL ISSUE ON GREEN COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR 6G NETWORKS", "authors": ["A Anpalagan", "W Ejaz", "S Krishna Sharma", "D Benevides da Costa", "M Jo", "J Kim", "K Zhu", "L Xu", "D Niyato", "A Bhowal", "S A\u010fssa", "RS Kshetrimayum"], "description": "Table of contents Page 1 DECEMBER 2021 VOLUME 5 NUMBER 4 ITGCBM (ISSN 2473-2400) \nEDITORIAL Recent Techniques of Green Information and Communications Technologies . . . . . \n. . . . . . . .

This paper proposes a fast adaptation and learning scheme of activity tracking policies when user statistics are unknown a priori, varying with time, and inconsistent for different users. In our stochastic optimization, user activities are required to be synchronized with a backend under a cellular data limit to avoid overcharges from cellular operators. The mobile device is charged intermittently using wireless or wired charging for receiving the required energy for transmission and sensing operations. Firstly, we propose an activity tracking policy by formulating a stochastic optimization as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP).

Prediction Scheme for Cognitive Radio", "authors": ["T Vamsi Krishna", "Ping Wang", "Dusit Niyato"], "description": "The Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables the unlicensed users to share the spectrum with the licensed users on a non-interfering basis. Spectrum sensing is an important function for the unlicensed users to determine availability of a channel in the licensed user\u2019s spectrum. However, spectrum sensing consumes considerable energy which can be reduced by employing predictive methods for discovering spectrum holes. Using a reliable prediction scheme, the unlicensed users will sense only those channels which are predicted to be idle. By achieving a low probability of error in predicting the idle channels, the spectrum utilization can also be improved. Since the traffic characteristics of most licensed user systems encountered in real life are not known a priori, we design the spectrum predictor using the neural network model, multilayer perceptron (MLP), which does not require a prior knowledge of the traffic characteristics of the licensed user systems.

However, wireless energy transfer from a wireless energy source has to be scheduled to minimize energy usage while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements of sensor nodes in the network. In this paper, we consider wireless powered body area network whose sensor nodes have auxiliary energy sources in addition to dedicated wireless energy transfer. We propose a distributed wireless energy transfer scheduling to achieve the aforementioned objective and meet the requirements. We formulate a constrained stochastic game model to obtain a multi-policy constrained Nash equilibrium of wireless energy transfer request. This equilibrium instructs the sensor node to request for wireless energy transfer based on its local state. The performance evaluation shows that the analytical model is well verified by simulations.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "title": "1 Power-management for base stations in smart grid environment", "authors": ["Xiao Lu", "Dusit Niyato", "Ping Wang"], "description": "The overall contribution of cellular network operators to the entire human CO2 emissions is estimated at 2.5% in the US [1]. Thereinto, about 60%\u2212 80% originates from wireless base stations (BSs)[2]. As current cellular network architectures are designed to cope with peak load and degraded conditions, underutilization of them occurs most of the time. A recent study [3] shows that the average power-consumption of the traditional BS amounts to nearly 850 W, with only up to 40 W power consumed to transmit from the antennas and the rest wasted even during idle operation. This result indicates that there is a large room for power savings for today\u2019s cellular networks. In this chapter, we consider the problem of power management for BSs with renewable power source in smart grid environment. In Section 1.2, we first provide an introduction of green wireless communications with the focus on two closely related research fields, ie, renewable power source and smart grid. Then, we provide an overview on the power-management approaches for BS, which consists of two major directions, ie, BS power control and smart BS operation. The former is achieved at the equipment level, while the latter can be realized at system/network level. Afterwards, we discuss some challenges and open issues with regard to power management for BS. In Section 1.3, we present the powerconsumption model for a BS. Specifically, the power consuming components are first introduced and analyzed. Moreover, we present two power-consumption models, one for macro BSs which contains a static power-consumption part only, and the other for micro BS which additionally\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "title": "Hierarchical Cooperation for Operator-Controlled Device-to-Device Communications: A Coalitional Game Perspective", "authors": ["Xiao Lu", "Ping Wang", "Dusit Niyato"], "description": "Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, which allows direct communication among mobile devices, have been proposed an enabler of local services in 3GPP LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) cellular networks. This work investigates a hierarchical LTE-A network framework consisting of multiple of D2D operators at the upper and a group of devices at lower layer. We propose a cooperative model that enables the operators to improve their utility in terms of revenue by sharing their devices, and the devices to improve their payoff in terms of end-to-end throughput by collaboratively perform multi-path routing. To help understanding the interaction among operators and devices, we present a game-theoretic framework to model the cooperation behavior, and further, we propose a layered coalitional game (LCG) to address the decision making problems among them. Specifically, the cooperation of operators is modeled as an overlapping coalition formation game (CFG) in partition form, in which operators should form a stable coalitional structure. While the cooperation of devices is modeled as a coalitional graphical game (CGG), in which devices establish links among each other to form a stable network structure for multi-path routing. We adopt the extended recursive core, and Nash network, as the stability concept for the proposed CFG and CGG, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed LCG yields notable gains compared to both the non-cooperative case and a LCG variant and achieves good convergence speed.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T8sVhLMAAAAJ&cstart=1200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=T8sVhLMAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "title": "Supply Optimization for Power Demand from PHEV Charging Stations", "authors": ["Qiumin Dong", "Dusit Niyato"], "description": "As plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) become more and more preferable to customers than the vehicles burning fossil fuels when the oil price goes up, the increasing power demand from PHEV charging stations will impose an challenge to the power grid operator that cannot be neglected.
