In our ongoing research project, we have built a data center testbed consisting of three test rooms hosting servers and network equipment. In particular, the testbed is equipped with cooling, heating, and ventilation systems that are under our full control. Thus, we can operate the testbed in a wide range of server room conditions. The test rooms and servers are instrumented with hardware and software sensors monitoring more than 200 measurement points. An extensive test plan is being executed to collect a large volume of data to understand the impact of environmental conditions on server's computing performance and reliability as well as the energy efficiency of the testbed.

As a fundamental performance measure of WSNs, coverage characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Two facets of coverage, i.e., spatial coverage and temporal coverage, quantify the percentage of area that is well monitored by the network and the timeliness of the network in detecting targets appearing in the sensing field, respectively. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on spatiotemporal coverage of WSNs are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this chapter, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of spatiotemporal coverage based on\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2014, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=co5MGPkAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=co5MGPkAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "title": "Energy-Saving Strategies in the Air-Cooled Tropical Data Center with Thermoeconomic Assessments", "authors": ["Fei Duan", "Jing Zhou", "Baris Burak Kanbur", "Duc Van Le", "Rui Tan"], "description": "Rapid developments of the electronic information industry promote energy usages of cooling system in data centers to be paid extensive attention, especially in the tropical environment.
