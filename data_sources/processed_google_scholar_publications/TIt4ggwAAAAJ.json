In the last few years, deep learning has advanced radically in such a way that it can surpass human-level performance on a number of tasks. As a consequence, deep learning is being extensively used in most of the recent day-to-day applications. However, security of deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model to misclassify the output. In recent times, different types of adversaries based on their threat model leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise a deep learning system where adversaries have high incentives. Hence, it is extremely important to provide robustness to deep learning algorithms against these adversaries. However, there are only a few strong countermeasures which can be used in all types of attack scenarios to design a robust deep learning system. In this paper, we attempt to provide a detailed discussion on different types of adversarial attacks with various threat models and also elaborate the efficiency and challenges of recent countermeasures against them.", "publication_year": 2018, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [2, 36, 101, 164, 278, 216, 0]}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "title": "Wireless communication and security issues for cyber\u2013physical systems and the Internet-of-Things", "authors": ["Andreas Burg", "Anupam Chattopadhyay", "Kwok-Yan Lam"], "description": "Wireless sensors and actuators connected by the Internet-of-Things (IoT) are central to the design of advanced cyber-physical systems (CPSs).

There, the portability issue is conveniently ignored to ease the experimental procedure. In parallel to the above developments, machine learning techniques are used in recent literature, demonstrating excellent performance in profiled side-channel attacks.

In physical implementation of quantum circuits, a long-distance interaction between two qubits is undesirable since, it can be interpreted as a noise.

The current literature on converting a given quantum circuit to an NN-arranged one mainly considered chained qubit topologies or Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) topology. However, practical quantum circuit realizations, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), may not have an LNN topology. To address this gap, we consider an arbitrary qubit topology.

This is due to the fact that these attacks typically work by recovering a single bit of information about the secret key per query/trace. In this respect, we propose novel parallel PC oracle based side-channel attacks, which are capable of recovering a generic P number of bits of information about the secret key in a single query/trace. We propose novel techniques to build chosen-ciphertexts so as to efficiently realize a parallel PC oracle for Kyber KEM.

Normalization of Hi-C contact map is essential for accurate modeling and interpretation of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (3C) experiments. Hi-C correction tools were originally developed to normalize systematic biases of karyotypically normal cell lines. However, a vast majority of available Hi-C datasets are derived from cancer cell lines that carry multi-level DNA copy number variations (CNVs). CNV regions display over- or under-representation of interaction frequencies compared to CN-neutral regions. Therefore, it is necessary to remove CNV-driven bias from chromatin interaction data of cancer cell lines to generate a euploid-equivalent contact map. We developed the HiCNAtra framework to compute high-resolution CNV profiles from Hi-C or 3C-seq data of cancer cell lines\u00a0and to correct chromatin contact maps from systematic biases including CNV-associated bias. First, we introduce a novel \u2018entire-fragment\u2019 counting method for better estimation of the read depth (RD) signal from Hi-C reads that recapitulates the whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-derived coverage signal.

The randomness of the proposed TRNGs is evaluated using the NIST test suite. Next, an architecture to implement the PUF in the RRAM crossbar is presented.

In binary quantum systems, some efficient implementation of arithmetic operations like, addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, square root, exponential and arcsine etc. have been realized, where resources are reported as a number of Toffoli gates or T gates with ancilla. Recently it has been demonstrated that intermediate qutrits can be used in place of ancilla, allowing us to operate efficiently in the ancilla-free frontier zone. In this article, we have incorporated intermediate qutrit approach to realize efficient implementation of all the quantum arithmetic operations mentioned above with respect to gate count and circuit-depth without T gate and ancilla. Our resource estimates with intermediate qutrits could guide future research aimed at lowering costs considering arithmetic operations for computational problems. As an application of computational problems, related to finance, are poised to reap the benefit of quantum computers, in which quantum arithmetic circuits are going to play an important role. In particular, quantum arithmetic circuits of arcsine and square root are necessary for path loading using the re-parameterization method, as well as the payoff calculation for derivative pricing. Hence, the improvements are studied in the context of the core arithmetic circuits as well as the complete application of derivative pricing.

First we consider resiliency and show that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be immediately used for this purpose. We also point out how the quadratic improvement in query complexity can be obtained over the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for this purpose using the Grover's technique. While the worst case quantum query complexity to check the resiliency order is exponential in the number of input variables of the Boolean function, we require polynomially many measurements only. We also describe a subset of -variable Boolean functions for which the algorithm works in polynomially many steps, ie, we can achieve an exponential speed-up over best known classical algorithms. A similar kind of approach can be exploited to check whether a Boolean function is symmetric (respectively linear) or not. Given a Boolean function as an oracle, it is important to devise certain algorithms to test whether it has a specific property or it is -far from having that property. The efficiency of the algorithm is judged by the number of calls to the oracle so that one can decide, with high probability, between these two alternatives. We show that this can be achieved in  query complexity.

Among these, hash based signatures are considered promising. The concept of hash functions is quite well-known/well-studied in the symmetric key cryptography over the past couple of decades, this gives an edge for these signatures.

BAKSHEESH runs for 35 rounds, which is 12.50 percent smaller compared to GIFT-128 (runs for 40 rounds) while maintaining the same security claims against the classical attacks. The crux of BAKSHEESH is to use a 4-bit SBox that has a non-trivial Linear Structure (LS). An SBox with one or more non-trivial LS has not been used in a cipher construction until DEFAULT (Asiacrypt'21). DEFAULT is pitched to have inherent protection against the Differential Fault Attack (DFA), thanks to its SBox having 3 non-trivial LS. BAKSHEESH, however, uses an SBox with only 1 non-trivial LS; and is a traditional cipher just like GIFT-128, with no claims against DFA. The SBox requires a low number of AND gates, making BAKSHEESH suitable for side channel countermeasures (when compared to GIFT-128) and other niche applications. Indeed, our study on the cost of the threshold implementation shows that BAKSHEESH offers a few-fold advantage over other lightweight ciphers. The design is not much deviated from its predecessor (GIFT-128), thereby allowing for easy implementation (such as fix-slicing in software). However, BAKSHEESH opts for the full-round key XOR, compared to the half-round key XOR in GIFT. Thus, when taking everything into account, we show how a cipher construction can benefit from the unique vantage point of using 1 LS SBox, by combining the state-of-the-art progress in classical cryptanalysis and protection against device-dependent attacks.

Peer-to-Peer federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm with a primary goal of learning a well-performing global model by collaboratively learning a shared model at different data hubs without the need of sharing data. Due to its immense practical applications, there is a growing attention towards various challenges of efficient federated learning including communication efficiency, assumptions on connectivity, data heterogeneity, enhanced privacy, etc. In this paper, we address the communication efficiency of Peer-to-Peer federated learning, modeling it using a graph theoretical framework.

Carefully crafted perturbations, imperceptible to human vision, can be added to images to force misclassification by an otherwise high performing neural network.

In this paper, we propose a framework for segregating and isolating regions within an input image which are particularly critical towards either classification (during inference), or adversarial vulnerability or both. We assert that during inference, the trained model looks at a specific region in the image, which we call Region of Importance (RoI); and the attacker looks at a region to alter/modify, which we call Region of Attack (RoA). The success of this approach could also be used to design a post-hoc adversarial defence method, as illustrated by our observations. This uses the notion of blocking out (we call neutralizing) that region of the image which is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks but is not important for the task of classification. We establish the theoretical setup for formalising the process of segregation, isolation and neutralization and substantiate it through empirical analysis on standard benchmarking datasets.

The current genetic techniques for authentication are time-consuming and require specific documentary standard and laboratory protocols. Given the fact that whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data are readily available, read depth (RD)-based computational analyses has allowed the estimation of genetic profiles of cell lines. Results We propose WGS-derived aneuploidy profiling as a prototype of digital karyotyping for authentication of cancer cell lines. Here, we describe a Python-based software AStra for de novo estimation of the genome-wide aneuploidy profile, the copy number of every genomic loci, from raw WGS reads. We demonstrated that aneuploidy profile offers a unique signature that can distinguish the clonal variants (strains) of a cell line. We evaluated our approach using simulated data and variety of cancer cell lines. We further showed that cell lines exhibit distinct aneuploidy patterns which corroborate well with the experimental observations. Conclusions AStra is a simple, user-friendly, and free tool that provides the elementary information about the chromosomal aneuploidy for cell line authentication. AStra provides an analytical and visualization platform for rapid and easy comparison between different cell lines/strains. We recommend AStra for rapid first-pass quality assessment of scientific data that employ cancer cell lines.

In such situations, accurate aneuploidy profiling of cancer data is critical for calibration of copy number (CN)-detection tools. Additionally, cancer cell populations suffer from different levels of clonal heterogeneity and aneuploidy alterations over time. The degree of heterogeneity adversely affects the segregation of the depth of coverage (DOC) signal into integral CN states. This, in turn, strongly influences the reliability of this data for ploidy profiling and copy number variation (CNV) analysis.ResultsWe developed AStra framework for aneuploidy profiling of cancer data and assessing their suitability for copy number analysis without any prior knowledge of the input sequencing data. AStra estimates the best-fit aneuploidy profile as the spectrum with most genomic segments around integral CN states. We employ this spectrum to extract the CN-associated features such as the homogeneity score (HS), whole-genome ploidy level, and CN correction factor. The HS measures the percentage of genomic regions around CN states. It is used as a reliability assessment of sequencing data for downstream aneuploidy profiling and CNV analysis. We evaluated the accuracy of AStra using 31 low-coverage datasets from 20 cancer cell lines. AStra successfully identified the aneuploidy spectrum of complex cell lines with HS greater than 75%.

In nonlinear variations thrust spacing steadily increases but approaches a stable value. The variations for large m, are complex, where thrust spacing increases to a maximum and then decreases down to a near-stable value.

We propose efficient strategies to construct chosen ciphertexts to instantiate the aforementioned oracles to perform full key recovery. We perform experimental validation of our attacks on the optimized implementation of Streamlined NTRU Prime obtained from the pqm4 public library, a testing and benchmarking framework for post quantum cryptographic schemes on the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. We positively confirm that both the PC and DF oracle-based attacks result in full key recovery in a few thousand traces with 100% success rate.

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed techniques compromising the Quality-of-Service (QoS) across all design abstractions.

In this paper, we propose an analytical reliability evaluation framework, based on probabilistic error masking matrices (PeMMs).
