Specifically, CorrNet3D consists of a deep feature embedding module and two novel modules called correspondence indicator and symmetric deformer. Feeding a pair of raw point clouds, our model first learns the pointwise features and passes them into the indicator to generate a learnable correspondence matrix used to permute the input pair. The symmetric deformer, with an additional regularized loss, transforms the two permuted point clouds to each other to drive the unsupervised learning of the correspondence. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets of rigid and non-rigid 3D shapes show our CorrNet3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods to a large extent, including those taking meshes as input.

However, computing SDF is computationally expensive since one has to place an inverted cone at each point and then average the penetration distances for a number of rays inside the cone. Furthermore, the shape diameters are highly sensitive to local geometric features as well as the normal vectors, hence diminishing their applications to real-world meshes which often contain rich geometric details and/or various types of defects, such as noise and gaps. In order to increase the robustness of SDF and promote it to a wide range of 3D models, we define SDF by offsetting the input object a little bit. This seemingly minor change brings three significant benefits: First, it allows us to compute SDF in a robust manner since the offset surface is able to give reliable normal vectors. Second, it runs many times faster since at each point we only need to compute the penetration distance along a single direction, rather than tens of directions. Third, our method does not require watertight surfaces as the input\u2014it supports both point clouds and meshes with noise and gaps.

Although neural implicit representations have emerged as a popular way of representing 3D shape geometries, there is still no research on representing geodesics with deep implicit functions. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first attempt to represent geodesics on 3D mesh models using neural implicit functions. Specifically, we introduce neural geodesic fields (NeuroGFs), which are learned to represent the all-pairs geodesics of a given mesh. By using NeuroGFs, we can efficiently and accurately answer queries of arbitrary point-to-point geodesic distances and paths, overcoming the limitations of traditional algorithms. Evaluations on common 3D models show that NeuroGFs exhibit exceptional performance in solving the single-source all-destination (SSAD) and point-to-point geodesics, and achieve high accuracy consistently. Moreover, NeuroGFs offer the unique advantage of encoding both 3D geometry and geodesics in a unified representation.

The ability of point cloud data to accurately capture and represent intricate 3D geometry makes it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications, including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving, all of which require an understanding of the underlying spatial structures. Given the challenges associated with annotating large-scale point clouds, self-supervised point cloud representation learning has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This approach aims to learn generic and useful point cloud representations from unlabeled data, circumventing the need for extensive manual annotations.

To bridge this gap, we propose ParaNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework, for representing 3D point clouds in a completely regular and nearly lossless manner. To be specific, ParaNet converts an irregular 3D point cloud into a regular 2D color image, named point geometry image (PGI), where each pixel encodes the spatial coordinates of a point. In contrast to conventional regular representation modalities based on multi-view projection and voxelization, the proposed representation is differentiable and reversible. Technically, ParaNet is composed of a surface embedding module, which parameterizes 3D surface points onto a unit square, and a grid resampling module, which resamples the embedded 2D manifold over regular dense grids. Note that ParaNet is unsupervised, i.e., the training simply relies on reference-free geometry constraints. The PGIs can be seamlessly coupled with a task network established upon standard and mature techniques for 2D images/videos to realize a specific task for 3D point clouds. We evaluate ParaNet over shape classification and point cloud upsampling, in which our solutions perform favorably against the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Inspired by the image edge detector, we compute the difference-of-Gaussian of illumination on the 3D model. With moderate assumption, we show all the expensive computations can be done in the pre-computing stage. Our method naturally integrates object- and image-spaces in that we compute the geometric features in the object space and then adopt a simple fragment shader to render the lines in the image space. As a result, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing object-space approaches, since the lines are generated in a single pass without iterating the mesh edges/faces. Furthermore, our method is more flexible and robust than the existing algorithms in that it does not require the preprocessing on the input 3D models. Finally, the difference-of-Gaussian operator can be extended to the anisotropic setting guided by local geometric features.

In DeepIMLS [6] and DOG [10], the SDF of a query point is formulated as the weighted averaging of the distances of the query point to the tangent planes of a set of MLS (moving least-squares) points, ie, Eq.(2) of DeepIMLS [6] and Eq.(3) of DOG [10]. In the GUE module of our method (ie, Eq.(4)), we formulate the UDF of a query point as the weighted averaging of the distances of the query point to the tangent planes of a set of neighboring points on the surface. Although the IMLS-based methods DeepIMLS [6] and DOG [10] and our method adopt similar formulas, they are significantly different.\u2022 In DeepIMLS [6] and DOG [10], the MLS points are NOT distributed on surfaces, and the MLS points and their weights are simultaneously learned ie, the MLP points are learned, which are then used to calculate their weights via a pre-defined function with a learnable factor directly (see Eq.(2) of [6] or Eq.(3) of [10]), resulting in that they may suffer from the coupling issue. Differently, in the GUE module of our method (ie, Eq.(4)), only the weights are learned.
