In this technique, a phase-shifting algorithm is used to calculate the wrapped phase, and a set of Gray-code binary patterns is used to determine the unwrapped phase. In the real measurement, the captured Gray-code patterns are no longer binary, resulting in phase unwrapping errors at a large number of erroneous pixels. Although this problem has been attended and well resolved by a few methods, it remains challenging when a measured object has step-heights and the captured patterns contain invalid pixels.

Our method first establishes the matching relationship of two images, after which it automatically paints one of them with the color information of the other using a region-matching algorithm. The region-matching algorithm is based on feature correspondences. The results show that the proposed algorithm can straightforwardly and robustly realize our objective and has a promising future for our next step to further automate conventional animation.", "publication_year": 2000, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 8, 6, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "title": "Skeleton based parametric solid models: Ball B-Spline curves", "authors": ["Zhongke Wu", "Hock Soon Seah", "Mingquan Zhou"], "description": "This paper proposes a parametric solid representation of freeform tubular objects - Ball B-Spline Curves (BBSCs), which are skeleton based parametric solid model.

Points with high curvature are computed and corresponded between strokes in interpolation, which preserves features of strokes in animation. In addition, global motion of a character or its various components is estimated and interpolated as well, which retains the shapes during the motion. By applying the information to interpolation, the distortion is eliminated and smoother sequence of animation is achieved.

Though 3D object detection can provide an object-level environmental description to fill this gap, a robot always encounters incomplete object observation, recurring detections of the same object, error in detection, or intersection between objects when conducting detection continuously in a cluttered room. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage 3D object detection algorithm which is to fuse multiple views of 3D object point clouds in the first stage and to eliminate unreasonable and intersection detections in the second stage. For each view, the robot performs a 2D object semantic segmentation and obtains 3D object point clouds. Then, an unsupervised segmentation method called Locally Convex Connected Patches (LCCP) is utilized to segment the object accurately from the background. Subsequently, the Manhattan Frame estimation is implemented to calculate the main orientation of the object and subsequently, the 3D object bounding box can be obtained. To deal with the detected objects in multiple views, we construct an object database and propose an object fusion criterion to maintain it automatically. Thus, the same object observed in multi-view is fused together and a more accurate bounding box can be calculated. Finally, we propose an object filtering approach based on prior knowledge to remove incorrect and intersecting objects in the object dataset.

However shadows are not always drawn due to time constraints and lack of animators especially when the production schedule is tight. To solve this problem, we develop an easy shadowing approach that enables animators to easily create a layer of shadow and its animation based on the character's shapes. Our approach is both instant and intuitive. The only inputs required are character or object shapes in input animation sequence with alpha value generally used in the Anime production pipeline.

In this paper, we propose a technique to solve the inverse caustic problem in which we compute the geometry of a semi-transparent homogeneous refractive object (caustic object) given a directional light source and a set of caustic patterns (each pattern is considered to be formed at a specified distance from the caustic object). We validate the results by using mental ray (software rendering). The novelty of our research is that we consider a set of caustic patterns whereas existing techniques only consider one caustic pattern. We employ a stochastic approach to simulate the refracted light beam paths that can approximately reconstruct the input caustic patterns. Working backward, from the computed refracted light beam paths we compute the geometry of the caustic object that can produce such light beam paths. Due to having multiple caustic patterns as the inputs, it is a challenge to reconstruct the input caustic patterns because of the differences in their shapes and intensities. We solve this problem by using a two-step optimization algorithm in which we adjust the position and size of the caustic regions in the first step and we adjust the caustic shapes in the second step.

Te compromise is that the movement tends to be stiff and perceived to be inferior in quality, as the audience can visually identify the same drawings being transformed over time, hence the animations look less realistic. Tis is a reason why in the fighting game genre, bone animations or \u201ccomponent-based animations,\u201d are not widely used (Rantala, 2013). Te emergence of 3D modeling and animation tools brought a change to this production problem, where animators manipulate virtual 3D puppets rather than having to create drawings frame by frame. However, the look and feel of 3D model rendering is very different from traditional cartoons based on line art, which many people think have lost the essential style of 2D cartoons. Multiple 3D-based cel-shading rendering methods have since been developed to re-capture this quality of the hand-drawn animation aesthetic (Nilsson & Lundmark, 2017). Among various methods, Arc System Works\u2019 UV-Aligned method seems the most visually impressive and closest to mimicking the 2D art style.

The ternary Gray code-based method uses four binary patterns, which can unwrap a phase with a large number of fringe periods.

Our acceleration scheme takes into account information across visible wavelengths of the scene, that is, the index of refraction (IOR) (caustic object), light power (light), and material reflectance (surface). To process visible wavelengths effectively, firstly we cluster the wavelengths which have similar first refraction (air to caustic object) directions.

As a result, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing object-space approaches, since the lines are generated in a single pass without iterating the mesh edges/faces. Furthermore, our method is more flexible and robust than the existing algorithms in that it does not require the preprocessing on the input 3D models.

The outlines of characters or objects on two key-frames are used as inputs. First, a skeleton linkage of the target object is automatically constructed by rasterizing each of input key-frames and then applying a pixel-based skeleton extraction method. Secondary, a pair of skeleton linkages having corresponding structure between the current key-frame and the next key-frame is constructed by applying the stroke matching algorithm. After these processes, motion transitions between the skeleton linkages are generated based on our simulation model. When the in-between frames are created only in the 2D plane, the outlines at in-between frames can be generated by a 2D deformation. In case that the in-between transitions are containing a rotation around an axis which is no perpendicular to the drawing plane, however, a 3D structure is required. For achieving such in-between transitions, our method constructs a 3D structure by inflating 2D mesh based on the input outlines. Finally, the contours from the view-point for the created 3D structure are projected onto the 2D plane during in-between transitions. In our method, we adopt the Photic Extremum Lines (PEL) to extract the 2D contours from the obtained 3D shape.

Effective use of this imaging modality in clinics largely depends on the capability of real-time 3D image reconstruction, cell and tissue feature detection, and rendering. To match the video rate of image streaming, the online detection and rendering of the volumetric features implied by the cellular images has been proven technically challenging. Upon a comprehensive survey and comparative analysis, in this paper, we present a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 3D feature detection and rendering, for an interactive visualization of the endomicroscopic images. We preprocess the acquired datasets by employing mathematical morphology with multiple render targets in a multi-pass approach on the GPU. A transfer function is defined online for the volume of interest (VOI), based on an automated local adaptive thresholding technology. The mechanism and GPU implementation techniques for dynamically generation of the transfer functions are presented. Advantages of this novel approach are shown in the experimental results.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "title": "DIRECT 3D STYLIZATION PIPELINES Real-Time Live!", "authors": ["Santiago Montesdeoca", "Hock Soon Seah", "Davide Benvenuti", "Hans-Martin Rall", "Pierre B\u00e9nard", "Jo\u00eblle Thollot", "Romain Vergne"], "description": "Direct 3D stylization pipelines Page 1 HAL Id: hal-01574958 https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01574958 \nSubmitted on 17 Aug 2017 HAL is a multi-disciplinary open access archive for the deposit and \ndissemination of scientific research documents, whether they are published or not.

Existing works addressing route queries mainly focus on static road networks rather than timeaware road networks. Observe the fact that the same road segment can be driven at different speeds during different time intervals, and users usually prefer driving on a route that consumes minimum energy within a travel time budget. Motivated by this, this paper studies the energy-efficient time-aware routing problem in road networks, denoted as EETAR. We take time factor into consideration and utilize a piecewise constant speed model to calculate the travel time along each road segment with different departure time. We also utilize a polynomial energy cost model to compute the energy consumption along each road segment with different departure time. As the problem of EETAR is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable approximation bounds to answer the route queries in real-world dense road networks. In addition, we also devise a greedy route planning algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can answer EETAR queries efficiently.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "title": "BEZIER CURVE-BASED SHAPE ENCODING FOR HAND-DRAWN IMAGES", "authors": ["Jianmin Zheng", "Hock Soon Seah", "De-Wei Randall Lim"], "description": "In this paper we propose a method for encoding hand-drawn images based on a parametric B\u00e9zier representation.

Polycube Geometry Images is a global surface parameterization technique such that the parametric domain is a Polycube (cubical complex). Polycube is a highly regular structure that describes the 3D surface topology and geometry while keeping consistency of surface with low distortion. By unfolding the Polycube adjacent facets, 3D surface attributes, such as color and normal, can be stored and accessed in the Polycube Geometry Images as 2D image. For example, painting and applying image processing via Polycube Geometry Images on 3D surface indirectly. To achieve this goal, we first propose a graph-based representation of Polycube Geometry Images for flexible interactive unfolding.
