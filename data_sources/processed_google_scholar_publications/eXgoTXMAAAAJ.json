Models that do consider multiple aspects often combine them through arbitrarily set weights. Therefore, they cannot work well when the credibility is not evaluated accurately or when the weights are not set properly.

In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) aided framework for generating hierarchical IoT organizational structures. We propose a novel unique mapping between organizational structures and genome representations. Since hierarchical (i.e., tree-structured) organizations are one of the most common forms of organizations, we propose a novel method to map the phenotypic hierarchical structure space into a genome-like array representation space.

However, manipulating individual model parameters is not only inefficient in meaningfully reducing the communication overhead when training large-scale FL models, but may also be detrimental to the scaling efforts and model performance as shown by recent research. To address these issues, we propose the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout (FedOBD) approach.

However, in many real applications (i.e., abnormality detection), there is a lack of sufficient data to achieve a good deep learning model. Considering the fact that collecting massive labeled training data for a new task is often expensive and time-consuming, it is critical to transfer and reuse the knowledge of the labeled data or simulation data to the new task. To tackle this issue, we propose a deep transfer learning method in this paper. On one hand, we pre-train a basic deep learning model with the related training data. Then, we treat the learning model as a starting point for the current problem to train the new deep learning model.

To minimize the QKD deployment cost in SAGIN with heterogeneous nodes, in this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for QKD over SAGIN using stochastic programming. The proposed scheme is formulated via two-stage stochastic programming (SP), while considering uncertainties such as security requirements and weather conditions.

Our model is an abstraction of emerging internet-based business models such as federated learning and crowd computing. To maintain an efficient and stable production coalition, the coordinator should share with producers the income brought by the virtual product. Besides the demand-side information asymmetry, another two sources of supply-side information asymmetry intertwined in this problem: 1) the capacity limit of each producer and 2) the cost incurred to each producer.

Therefore, removing ineffective factors accordingly can significantly improve system efficiency. In this paper, we report our experience incorporating our Contextual Factor Selection (CFS) approach into the Taobao e-commerce platform to optimize the selection of factors based on the context of each search query in order to simultaneously achieve high quality search results while significantly reducing latency time.

Existing model-heterogeneous FL approaches often require publicly available datasets and incur high communication and/or computational costs, which limit their performances. To address these limitations, we propose the Federated Global prediction Header (FedGH) approach. It is a communication and computation-efficient model-heterogeneous FL framework which trains a shared generalized global prediction header with representations extracted by heterogeneous extractors for clients' models at the FL server. The trained generalized global prediction header learns from different clients. The acquired global knowledge is then transferred to clients to substitute each client's local prediction header. We derive the non-convex convergence rate of FedGH.

Thus, existing VFL methods are unsuitable for multi-party scenarios. Moreover, in VFL scenarios, it is difficult to establish an FL server that can be trusted by all participants. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient Multi-participant Vertical Federated Learning approach based on Secret Sharing (MVFLS). On the one hand, it uses secret sharing instead of homomorphic encryption, which effectively reduces the computational cost. On the other hand, benefiting from secret sharing, it enables VFL to be performed in multi-participant scenarios while eliminating the dependence on having an FL server.

A job in data-intensive applications is typically represented by a directed acyclic graph which can further be transformed into a chain of tasks. The key to achieving cost efficiency is determining the allocation of a specific deadline to each task, as well as the allocation of different types of instances to the task. In this paper, we propose a framework that determines the optimal allocation of deadlines to tasks. The framework also features an optimal policy to determine the allocation of spot and on-demand instances in a predefined time window, and a near-optimal policy for allocating self-owned instances. The policies are designed to be parametric to support the usage of online learning to infer the optimal values against the dynamics of cloud markets. Finally, several intuitive heuristics are used as baselines to validate the cost improvement brought by the proposed solutions.

In addition, online promotional campaigns, which attract high traffic volumes, are also a critical factor affecting e-commerce recommender systems. Typically, prior to a promotional campaign, the Add-to-Cart Rate (ACR) is the target of optimization. During the campaign, this changes to Gross Merchandise Volumes (GMV). Immediately after the campaign, it becomes Click Through Rates CTR.

Furthermore, in distributed QCC, entanglement routing is a critical component of quantum networks that enables remote entanglement communication between users and QCC providers. Further, maintaining entanglement fidelity in quantum networks is challenging due to the requirement for high-quality entanglement routing, especially when accessing the providers over long distances. To address these challenges, we propose a resource allocation model to provision quantum computing and networking resources. In particular, entangled pairs, entanglement routing, qubit resources, and circuits' waiting time are jointly optimized to achieve minimum total costs. We formulate the proposed model based on the two-stage stochastic programming, which takes into account the uncertainties of fidelity and qubit requirements, and quantum circuits' waiting time. Furthermore, we apply the Benders decomposition algorithm to divide the proposed model into sub-models to be solved simultaneously.

Therefore, removing redundant factors can significantly improve search engine efficiency.

Over the past decade, the importance of trust management in computational intelligence research (e.g. in multi-agent systems (MASs)) has been recognized by both the industry and the academia. Computational trust models for evaluating the trustworthiness of a trustee agent based on a wide range of evidence have been proposed. Nevertheless, two important research problems remain open in this field. Firstly, how to mitigate the adverse effects of biased third-party testimonies on the accuracy of evaluating the trustworthiness of an agent? Secondly, how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to efficiently utilize the capacities of trustee agents to achieve high social welfare? This thesis presents the research into addressing these two problems. It first proposes a novel reinforcement learning based trust evidence aggregation model \u2013 namely the Actor-Critic Trust (ACT) model \u2013 to address the problem of biased testimonies. Individual truster agents can use the ACT model to dynamically learn to adjust the selection of witness agents, the weights given to each of their testimonies, as well as the weights given to the collective opinions of the witness agents and the first-hand trust evidence to produce a trustworthiness evaluation. The model operates according to observable changes in the MAS environment and has been shown to be robust against collusions among witness agents. The ACT model eliminates the need for manually tuning these weight parameters in most existing trust models and makes agents more\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2014, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eXgoTXMAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eXgoTXMAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "title": "Developing Mobile 3D Game Using MIDP 2.0 Game API and JSR-184 M3G API", "authors": ["Han Yu"], "description": null, "publication_year": 2005, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}]
