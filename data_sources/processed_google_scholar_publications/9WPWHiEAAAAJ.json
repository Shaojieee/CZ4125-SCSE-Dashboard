Volumes of the temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus were measured by manually outlining these structures on contiguous 2-mm thick coronal slices.ResultsPatients with childhood-onset schizophrenia had significantly smaller cerebral volumes. With no adjustment for brain volume, no diagnostic differences were observed for any temporal lobe structure. Unexpectedly, with adjustment for total cerebral volume, larger volumes of the superior temporal gyrus and its posterior segment and a trend toward larger temporal lobe volume emerged for the patients with schizophrenia.

Methodology/Principal Findings We have systematically examined the proteome, cytokines and inflammatory markers in sera from 62 adult dengue patients (44 DF; 18 DHF) with primary DENV infection, at three different times of infection representing the early febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages. Using fluorescent bioplex assays, we measured 27 cytokines in these serum samples.

Using multiple methods such as OPLS, MRMR and MSVM-RFE for multivariate feature selection and classification, we report molecular markers that allow prediction of primary DHF with sensitivity and specificity of >80%.

Although HR is mostly error free, inherent or environmental conditions that either suppress or induce HR cause genomic instability. Despite its importance in carcinogenesis, due to limitations in our ability to detect HR in vivo, little is known about HR in mammalian tissues. Here, we describe a mouse model in which a direct repeat HR substrate is targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice, HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues, and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues, wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally, de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon, showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide, shows that the colon, liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally, histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells.

There is an increased interest in building gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from temporal gene expression data because of their numerous applications in life sciences. However, because of the limited number of time points at which gene expressions can be gathered in practice, computational techniques of building GRN often lead to inaccuracies and instabilities. This paper investigates the stability of sparse auto-regressive models of building GRN from gene expression data. Criteria for evaluating the stability of estimating GRN structure are proposed. Thereby, stability of multivariate vector autoregressive (MVAR) methods - ridge, lasso, and elastic-net - of building GRN were studied by simulating temporal gene expression datasets on scale-free topologies as well as on real data gathered over Hela cell-cycle. Effects of the number of time points on the stability of constructing GRN are investigated. When the number of time points are relatively low compared to the size of network, both accuracy and stability are adversely affected. At least, the number of time points equal to the number of genes in the network are needed to achieve decent accuracy and stability of the networks. Our results on synthetic data indicate that the stability of lasso and elastic-net MVAR methods are comparable, and their accuracies are much higher than the ridge MVAR.

By exploring whole brain WM skeleton images by using LDA, three latent factors were revealed in AD: a temporal-frontal impairment factor (temporal and frontal lobes, especially hippocampus and para-hippocampus), a parietal factor (parietal lobe, especially precuneus), and a long fibre bundle factor (corpus callosum and superior\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2018, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [0, 0, 4, 6, 1, 4, 0]}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "title": "Correlation of cell membrane dynamics and cell motility", "authors": ["Merlin Veronika", "Roy Welsch", "Alvin Ng", "Paul Matsudaira", "Jagath C Rajapakse"], "description": "Essential events of cell development and homeostasis are revealed by the associated changes of cell morphology and therefore have been widely used as a key indicator of physiological states and molecular pathways affecting various cellular functions via cytoskeleton. Cell motility is a complex phenomenon primarily driven by the actin network, which plays an important role in shaping the morphology of the cells. Most of the morphology based features are approximated from cell periphery but its dynamics have received none to scant attention. We aim to bridge the gap between membrane dynamics and cell states from the perspective of whole cell movement by identifying cell edge patterns and its correlation with cell dynamics. We present a systematic study to extract, classify, and compare cell dynamics in terms of cell motility and edge activity. Cell motility features extracted by fitting a persistent random walk were used to identify the initial set of cell subpopulations. We propose algorithms to extract edge features along the entire cell periphery such as protrusion and retraction velocity. These constitute a unique set of multivariate time-lapse edge features that are then used to profile subclasses of cell dynamics by unsupervised clustering. By comparing membrane dynamic patterns exhibited by each subclass of cells, correlated trends of edge and cell movements were identified.

One major aspect of discovering biological knowledge is to search, predict, or model specific patterns present in a given dataset and then to interpret those patterns. Computer science methods such as evolutionary computation, machine learning, and data mining all have a great deal to offer the field of bioinformatics. The goal of the Fifth European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning, and Data Mining in Bioinformatics (EvoBIO 2007) was to bring experts in computer science together with experts in bioinformatics and the biological sciences to explore new and novel methods for solving complex biological problems.

We therefore propose a systematic probabilistic framework on fusing GE data and transitive protein interaction data to coherently build GRN. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to soft-cluster GE data, allowing overlapping cluster memberships. Next, a heuristic method is proposed to extend sparse PPIN by incorporating transitive linkages. We then propose a novel way to score extended protein interactions by combining topological properties of PPIN and correlations of GE. Following this, GE data and extended PPIN are fused using a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) in order to identify gene regulatory pathways and refine interaction scores that are then used to constrain the GRN structure. We employ a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (BGM) model to refine the GRN derived from GE data by using the structural priors derived from GHMM. Experiments on real yeast regulatory networks demonstrate both the feasibility of the extended PPIN in predicting transitive protein interactions and its effectiveness on improving the coverage and accuracy the proposed method of fusing PPIN and GE to build GRN.

We propose a deep neural network architecture that combines both structural and functional connectome data with multi-omics data for disease classification. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) are used to model functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data simultaneously to learn compact representations of the connectome. A separate set of GCNs are then used to model multi-omics datasets, expressed in the form of patient similarity networks, and combine them with latent representations of the connectome. An attention mechanism is used to fuse the GCN outputs, which provides insights on which omics data contributed most to the model's classification decision.

In this paper, we mine evidences for time delays related to the transcriptional regulation of yeast from the PubMed abstracts.

Specifically, the speed-up or delay in transcriptional regulation rate can provide evidences for time delays (shorter or longer) in GRN.

This is achieved by introducing energies of external discontinuity cliques of multiple sensor data to the minimizing energy functional. The fusion improves the reconstruction error in individual sensors, and the detection of discontinuities, and reduces the false detection of discontinuities.

Moreover, the locations of individual convolutions on the brain surface depend on local changes in cortical structure, with sulci occurring in relation to boundaries between cortical architectonic fields.

For instance, large cohorts of patients are often screened using different high-throughput technologies, effectively producing multiple patient-specific molecular profiles for hundreds or thousands of patients. Results We propose and implement a network-based method that integrates such patient omics data into Patient Similarity Networks. Topological features derived from these networks were then used to predict relevant clinical features. As part of the 2017 CAMDA challenge, we have successfully applied this strategy to a neuroblastoma dataset, consisting of genomic and transcriptomic data. In particular, we observe that models built on our network-based approach perform at least as well as state of the art models. We furthermore explore the effectiveness of various topological features and observe, for instance, that redundant centrality metrics can be combined to build more powerful models.

Factors that control transition from mild forms of disease such as dengue fever (DF) to more life-threatening forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are poorly understood. Consequently, there are no reliable methods currently available for early triage of DHF patients resulting in significant over-hospitalization. Methodology/Principal FindingsWe have systematically examined the proteome, cytokines and inflammatory markers in sera from 62 adult dengue patients (44 DF; 18 DHF) with primary DENV infection, at three different times of infection representing the early febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages. Using fluorescent bioplex assays, we measured 27 cytokines in these serum samples. Additionally, we used multiple mass spectrometry methods for iTRAQ-based comparative analysis of serum proteome as well as measurements of protein adducts- 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine as surrogate measures of free radical activity. Using multiple methods such as OPLS, MRMR and MSVM-RFE for multivariate feature selection and classification, we report molecular markers that allow prediction of primary DHF with sensitivity and specificity of >80%.

Particularly, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is probably the most important technique that noninvasively studies brain functions under numerous cognitive and behavioral tasks. Functional brain studies acquire a time series of brain scans while the subject is alternatively performing an experimental task and a baseline task (so that the input stimulus to the brain takes the form of an on-off box-car pattern). Brain regions of interest are then detected through measuring the oxygenation level variations in blood vessels near the neurons activated by the input stimulus, ie, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The detection of brain activation provides functional maps exhibiting which brain regions correspond to specific sensory or cognitive tasks. In fMRI experiments, the BOLD signal (or the hemodynamic response) changes resulted from neural activities follow the pattern of input stimulus, but are usually contaminated by high-level noises (Bandettini et al., 1993).

We studied the perceptional evaluation of this universal display and addressed specially its role in mediating particular emotions.

In addition, we varied the quality of emotions encoded in the stimuli and tested also effects of signal transmission via telephone. Judgements were extracted from audiovisual recordings and from selfreport data collected after each trial. Data analyses revealed that the decoding of emotions was almost equally good for whispered and spoken stimuli, and also not markedly impaired when filtered by a phone.

Most techniques perform the detection of activation in spatial and tempor al domains separately. Simultaneous analysis is ideal for analyzing the fMRI images as they account for the information distributed between both domains. Such simultaneous analysis of fMRI is referred to as spatiotemporal analysis. Benali et. al.[1] have introduced a spatiotemporal technique using the fixed effect model as an extension to principal component analysis (PCA). Distinguishing feature in this technique is the ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal domain prior knowledge into the modeling approach by incorporating into the covariance structure. However, this technique is only applicable to input stimulus having equal durations of ON and OFF states (symmetric experiments).
