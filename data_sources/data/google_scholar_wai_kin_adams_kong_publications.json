Among biometric technologies,  IrisCode developed by Daugman in 1993 is regarded as a highly accurate approach, being able to support real-time personal identification of large databases. Since 1993, on the top of IrisCode, different coding methods have been proposed for iris and fingerprint identification. In this research, I extend and generalize IrisCode for real-time secure palmprint identification.  PalmCode, the first coding method for palmprint identification developed by me in 2002, directly applied IrisCode to extract phase information of palmprints as features. However, I observe that the PalmCodes from the different palms are similar, having many 45o streaks. Such structural similarities in the PalmCodes of different palms would reduce the individuality of PalmCodes and the performance of palmprint identification systems. To reduce the correlation between PalmCodes, in this thesis, I employ multiple elliptical Gabor filters with different orientations to compute different PalmCodes and merge them to produce a single feature, called Fusion Code. Experimental results demonstrate that Fusion Code performs better than PalmCode. Based on the results of Fusion Code, I further identify that the orientation fields of palmprints are powerful features.

Specifically, to improve unimodal representations, a unimodal refinement module is designed to refine modality-specific learning via iteratively updating the distribution with transformer-based attention layers. Self-quality improvement layers are followed to generate the desired weighted representations progressively. Subsequently, those unimodal representations are projected into a common latent space, regularized by a multimodal Jensen-Shannon divergence loss for better crossmodal refinement. Lastly, a crossmodal refinement module is employed to integrate all information. By hierarchical explorations on unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions, UCRN is highly robust against missing modality and noisy data.

In this paper, two new threats named disappearing attack and appearing attack against object detectors with a non-local block are investigated. The former aims at misleading an object detector with a non-local block such that it is unable to detect a target object category while the latter aims at misleading the object detector such that it detects a predefined object category, which is not present in images. Different from the existing attacks against object detectors, these threats are able to\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=2GfXvbUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=2GfXvbUAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C": {"external_link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200802500M/abstract", "authors": ["Wojciech Michal Matkowski", "Adams Wai Kin Kong"], "publication_date": "2020/8", "journal": "arXiv e-prints", "pages": "arXiv: 2008.02500", "description": "Soft biometric attributes such as gender, ethnicity or age may provide useful information for biometrics and forensics applications.

To tackle the key issues such as palmprint feature extraction, representation, indexing, matching criteria and fast search for large data archives, we introduce, a hierarchical palmprint coding scheme to facilitate coarse-to-fine matching for efficient and effective palmprint classification. The proposed scheme consists of four levels: 1) a global geometry based feature for palmprint location (Level-1 feature), 2) a global texture based feature for palmprint grouping (Level-2 feature), 3) a local fuzzy\" interest line\" detection for palmprint selection (Level-3 feature), 4) a local texture energy vector for fine palmprint matching (Level-4 feature). In addition, we adopt a mask based statistical measurement to extract texture feature in palmprints, which is characterized by its high convergence of inner-palm similarities and good dispersion of inter-palm discrimination. Furthermore, we apply fuzzy set technology to detect dominant feature, points (\" interest\" points) and lines (\" interest\" lines) to guide matching. A wide range of palmprint images have been tested to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=2GfXvbUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=2GfXvbUAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC": {"external_link": "https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/an-effective-coordinate-system-to-solve-tilting-problem-for-iris-", "authors": ["A Kong", "Dapeng Zhang"], "publication_date": "2000", "conference": "International Conference on Image and Graphics [ICIG]", "description": "An effective coordinate system to solve tilting problem for iris recognition \u2014 PolyU Scholars Hub \nSkip to main navigation Skip to search Skip to main content PolyU Scholars Hub Home PolyU \nScholars Hub Logo Help & FAQ Home Researchers Units Research output Prizes Activities \nPress/Media Student theses Search by expertise, name or affiliation An effective coordinate \nsystem to solve tilting problem for iris recognition A.
