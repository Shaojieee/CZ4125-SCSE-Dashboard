Computing PageRank for large graphs is challenging and this has motivated the studies of distributed algorithms to compute PageRank. Previously, little works have been spent on the distributed PageRank algorithms with provably desired complexity and accuracy. Given a graph with n nodes and if we model the distributed computation model as the well-known congested clique model, the state-of-the-art algorithm takes O (\u221a logn) communication rounds to approximate the PageRank value of each node in G, with a probability at least 1\u2212 1/n. In this paper, we present improved distributed algorithms for computing PageRank. Particularly, our algorithm performs O (log log\u221a n) rounds (a significant improvement compared with O (\u221a logn) rounds) to approximate the PageRank values with a probability at least 1\u2212 1/n. Moreover, under a reasonable assumption, our algorithm also reduces the edge bandwidth (ie, the maximum communication message size that can be exchanged through an edge during a communication round) by a O (logn) factor compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm.

A successful representative is Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), which essentially operates on the space of node features but ignores topological structures, and just considers global graph summary. In this paper, we present an effective model called Deep Graph Structural Infomax (DGSI) to learn node representation. We explore to derive the structural mutual information from the perspective of Information Bottleneck (IB), which defines a trade-off between the sufficiency and minimality of representation on the condition of the topological structure preservation. Intuitively, the derived constraints formally maximize the structural mutual information both edge-wise and local neighborhood-wise. Besides, we develop a general framework that incorporates the global representational mutual information, local representational mutual information, and sufficient structural information into the node representation. Essentially, our DGSI extends DGI and could capture more fine-grained semantic information as well as beneficial structural information in a self-supervised manner, thereby improving node representation and further boosting the learning performance.

Due to its high computation complexity, single-source SimRank computation for large graphs is notoriously challenging, and hence recent studies resort to distributed processing. To our surprise, although SimRank has been widely adopted for two decades, theoretical aspects of distributed SimRanks with provable results have rarely been studied. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study on single-source SimRank computation in the Massive Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which is the standard theoretical framework modeling distributed systems such as MapReduce, Hadoop, or Spark. Existing distributed SimRank algorithms enforce either  communication round complexity or  machine space for a graph of  nodes. We overcome this barrier.

To address these issues, in this paper, we present the community search based on contrastive learning with partition, namely COCLEP, which only requires a few labels and is both memory and query efficient. In particular, given a small collection of query nodes and a few (eg, three) corresponding ground-truth community nodes for each query, COCLEP learns a querydependent model through the proposed graph neural network and the designed label-aware contrastive learner. The former perceives query node information, low-order neighborhood information, and high-order hypergraph structure information, the latter contrasts low-order intra-view, high-order intra-view, and low-high-order inter-view representations of the nodes.

From the perspective of database solutions, it is desirable to have a solution that can be well adapted to different workloads, or has the workload adaptability.  Further, the system hardware to deploy the service can change from time to time. As a location-based service expands and scales, its system needs to be upgraded to more powerful machines (e.g., one with many CPU cores). To effectively optimize the performance, a good database solution should be able to exploit the full potential of high-performance hardware with minimum engineering efforts. In other words, it is interesting to design a solution that has good system adaptability.  In addition, the workloads also change with the given requirements on the application. Take the task of approximating PPRs as an example, we often require that the estimations should be within e relative errors. A natural question is, whether the computation optimization should be dependent on e?

These two types of queries find important applications in practice, and a plethora of solutions have been proposed in past few decades. The existing solutions, however, are optimized for either practical or asymptotic performance, but not both. In particular, the techniques with enhanced practical efficiency are mostly heuristic-based, and they offer unattractive worst-case guarantees in terms of space and time. On the other hand, the methods that are worst-case efficient often entail prohibitive preprocessing or space overheads, which render them inapplicable for the large road networks (with millions of nodes) commonly used in modern map applications.

Given a vertex q of a graph, the community search operation finds a subgraph, or community, which contains vertices closely related to q. Communities are prevalent in social networks, bibliographical graphs, and knowledge bases, and they enable emerging applications like product advertisement and setting up of social events. Existing community search algorithms, which are based mainly on the relationships (or edges) between vertices, overlook the important information carried by the attributes of vertices. We found that communities returned by these algorithms often consist of vertices having keywords about a variety of topics, and this makes it difficult to interpret the meanings behind those communities.In this paper, we investigate how vertex attributes can be used to generate communities that are easier to analyze. Particularly, we propose the label-aware community (or LAC), which not just requires vertices to be structurally close to each other, but also needs to have common labels. The LAC allows a better understanding of how and why a community is formed (eg, members of an LAC have a common interest in yoga, because they all have the same label \u201cyoga\u201d). To enable efficient LAC search, we develop a data structure called the CL-tree, and investigate novel query algorithms based on it. We evaluate our solutions on four large graphs, namely Flickr, DBLP, Tencent, and DBpedia. Our experimental results show that LACs can be extracted efficiently. Moreover, they reflect more precise meanings than communities found by existing\u00a0\u2026"}}
