However, SMPL parameters, especially pose parameters, are not easy to learn because of ambiguity and locality of the pose representation. Thus, we propose to incorporate skeleton awareness into the deep learning based regression of SMPL parameters for 3D human shape reconstruction. Our basic idea is to use the state-of-the-art technique PointNet++ to extract point features, and then map point features to skeleton joint features and finally to SMPL parameters for the reconstruction from point clouds. Particularly, we develop an end-to-end framework, where we propose a graph aggregation module to augment PointNet++ by extracting better point features, an attention module to better map unordered point features into ordered skeleton joint features, and a skeleton graph module to extract better joint features for SMPL parameter regression.

Compared to other robotic hands, our design saves the time required for assembling and adjusting, which makes our robotic hand ready-to-use right after the 3D printing is completed. Finally, the actuation of the hand is realized by cables and motors. Based on this approach, we have designed a cost-effective, 3D printable, compact, and lightweight robotic hand. Our robotic hand weighs 150\u2009g, has 15 joints, which are similar to a real human hand, and 6 Degree of Freedom (DOFs). It is actuated by only six small size actuators. The wrist connecting part is also integrated into the hand model and could be customized for different robots such as Nadine robot (Magnenat Thalmann et al., ). The compact servo bed can be hidden inside the Nadine robot\u2019s sleeve and the whole robotic hand\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2018": 2, "2019": 10, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sGCf2k0AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=sGCf2k0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC": {"external_link": "http://archive.ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/pacm_download/53/511-jZ-surfaceImp.pdf", "authors": ["Jianmin Zheng", "Thomas W Sederberg", "Eng-Wee Chionh", "David A Cox"], "publication_date": "2003", "journal": "Contemporary Mathematics", "volume": "334", "pages": "151-168", "publisher": "Providence, RI; American Mathematical Society; 1999", "description": "The method of moving planes and moving quadrics can express the implicit equation of a parametric surface as the determinant of a matrix M. The rows of M correspond to moving planes or moving quadrics that follow the parametric surface. Previous papers on the method of moving surfaces have shown that a simple base point has the effect of converting one moving quadric to a moving plane. A much more general version of the method of moving surfaces is presented in this paper that is capable of dealing with multiple base points. For example, a double base point has the effect (in this new version) of converting two moving quadrics into moving planes, eliminating one additional moving quadric, and eliminating a column of the matrix (ie, a blending function of the moving surfaces)\u2014thereby dropping the degree of the implicit equation by four. Furthermore, this is a unifying approach whereby tensor product surfaces, pure degree surfaces, and \u201ccorner-cut\u201d surfaces, can all be implicitized under the same framework and do not need to be treated as distinct cases. The central idea in this approach is that if a surface has a base point of multiplicity k, the moving surface blending functions must have the same base point, but of multiplicity k\u2212 1. Thus, we draw moving surface blending functions from the derivative ideal I, where I is the ideal of the parametric equations. We explain the general outline of the method and show how it works in some specific cases.

But they neglect the strong connections between object geometry and instance semantic information, which leads to inaccurate modeling of individual instance.

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to enable end-to-end instance segmentation without detection and a separate step of grouping. The core idea is to convert instance segmentation to a candidate assignment problem. At first, a set of instance candidates is sampled.

The actual image data corresponding to non-zero pixels is stored in the finest nodes of the quadtree. Convolution and pooling operations are restricted to the sparse pixels, leading to better efficiency in computation time as well as memory usage. Specifically, the computational and memory costs in QCNN grow linearly in the number of non-zero pixels, as opposed to traditional CNNs where the costs are quadratic in the number of pixels. This enables QCNN to learn from sparse images much faster and process high resolution images without the memory constraints faced by traditional CNNs.

In this paper we present a novel algebraic B-spline curve fitting method which combines both geometric distance and algebraic distance.

Unlike traditional multi-view stereo approaches, the neural implicit surface-based methods leverage neural networks to represent 3D scenes as signed distance functions (SDFs). However, they tend to disregard the reconstruction of individual objects within the scene, which limits their performance and practical applications. To address this issue, previous work ObjectSDF introduced a nice framework of object-composition neural implicit surfaces, which utilizes 2D instance masks to supervise individual object SDFs. In this paper, we propose a new framework called ObjectSDF++ to overcome the limitations of ObjectSDF. First, in contrast to ObjectSDF whose performance is primarily restricted by its converted semantic field, the core component of our model is an occlusion-aware object opacity rendering formulation that directly volume-renders object opacity to be supervised with instance masks. Second, we design a novel regularization term for object distinction, which can effectively mitigate the issue that ObjectSDF may result in unexpected reconstruction in invisible regions due to the lack of constraint to prevent collisions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our novel framework not only produces superior object reconstruction results but also significantly improves the quality of scene reconstruction.

While deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image dense prediction tasks, directly applying or extending these methods to irregular graph data, such as 3D surface meshes, is nontrivial due to the non-uniform element distribution and irregular connectivity in surface meshes which make it difficult to adapt downsampling, upsampling, and convolution operations. In addition, commonly used multiresolution networks require repeated high-to-low and then low-to-high processes to boost the performance of recovering rich, high-resolution representations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a self-parameterization-based multi-resolution convolution network that extends existing image dense prediction architectures to 3D meshes.

In scenarios involving non-negligible hook mass or long rig-cable, the hook-payload unit exhibits double-pendulum behaviour, making the problem highly challenging. This article introduces an offline multi-objective anti-swing trajectory planning module for a Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system of autonomous double-pendulum tower cranes, addressing all the transient state constraints. A set of auxiliary outputs are selected by methodically analyzing the payload swing dynamics and are used to prove the differential flatness property of the crane operations. The flat outputs are parameterized via suitable B\\'{e}zier curves to formulate the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems in the flat output space. A novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Collective Oppositional Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (CO-GDE3) is employed as the optimizer. To obtain faster convergence and better consistency in getting a wide range of good solutions, a new population initialization strategy is integrated into the conventional GDE3. The computationally efficient initialization method incorporates various concepts of computational opposition. Statistical comparisons based on trolley and slew operations verify the superiority of convergence and reliability of CO-GDE3 over the standard GDE3.

Properly distributing heterogeneous elastic materials over an object is important in part design and becomes an active research topic in computer aided design and graphics. This paper considers the problem of how to design heterogeneous elastic materials over a hexahedral mesh model that commonly appears in computer-aided design and engineering applications. Existing approaches to solving the problem typically apply L2 regularization that is good for smoothly distributed material. Considering that many real-world objects likely have sparse material distribution, we propose an optimization formulation with a carefully designed objective function and L0 regularization. An iterative algorithm is presented to solve the L0-optimization problem. The L0 regularization encourages sparsity of the output material distribution, which may facilitate some approaches for digital material design in multi-material additive manufacturing.
