As the performance density of traditional CPU-centric architectures stagnates, advancing compute capabilities necessitates novel architectural approaches. Near-memory processing (NMP) architectures are reemerging as promising candidates to improve computing efficiency through tight coupling of logic and memory. NMP architectures are especially fitting for data analytics, as they provide immense bandwidth to memory-resident data and dramatically reduce data movement, the main source of energy consumption. Modern data analytics operators are optimized for CPU execution and hence rely on large caches and employ random memory accesses. In the context of NMP, such random accesses result in wasteful DRAM row buffer activations that account for a significant fraction of the total memory access energy. In addition, utilizing NMP\u2019s ample bandwidth with fine-grained random accesses requires complex hardware that cannot be accommodated under NMP\u2019s tight area and power constraints. Our thesis is that efficient NMP calls for an algorithm-hardware co-design that favors algorithms with sequential accesses to enable simple hardware that accesses memory in streams. We introduce an instance of such a co-designed NMP architecture for data analytics, the Mondrian Data Engine. Compared to a CPU-centric and a baseline NMP system, the Mondrian Data Engine improves the performance of basic data analytics operators by up to 49\u00d7 and 5\u00d7, and efficiency\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 19, "2020": 16, "2021": 35, "2022": 32, "2023": 19}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cZ9jA9oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cZ9jA9oAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446714", "authors": ["Dmitrii Ustiugov", "Plamen Petrov", "Marios Kogias", "Edouard Bugnion", "Boris Grot"], "publication_date": "2021/4/19", "book": "Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems", "pages": "559-572", "description": "Serverless computing has seen rapid adoption due to its high scalability and flexible, pay-as-you-go billing model.

Hence, the provider needs to timely spawn, or tear down, function instances (i.e., HTTP servers with user-provider handles), which cannot hold state across function invocations. Performance of a modern serverless cloud is bound by data movement. Serverless architecture separates compute resources and data management to allow function instances to run on any node in a cloud datacenter. This flexibility comes at the cost of the necessity to move function initialization state across the entire datacenter when spawning new instances on demand. Furthermore, to facilitate scaling, cloud providers restrict the serverless programming model to stateless functions (which cannot hold or share state across different functions), which lack efficient support for cross-function communication.

Problematically, today's serverless clouds lack efficient support for cross-function data transfers in a workflow, preventing the efficient execution of data-intensive serverless applications. In production clouds, functions transmit intermediate, i.e., ephemeral, data to other functions either as part of invocation HTTP requests (i.e., inline) or via third-party services, such as AWS S3 storage or AWS ElastiCache in-memory cache. The former approach is restricted to small transfer sizes, while the latter supports arbitrary transfers but suffers from performance and cost overheads. This work introduces Expedited Data Transfers (XDT), an API-preserving high-performance data communication method for serverless that enables direct function-to-function transfers. With XDT, a trusted component of the sender function buffers the payload in its memory and sends a secure reference to the receiver, which is picked by the load balancer and autoscaler based on the current load.
