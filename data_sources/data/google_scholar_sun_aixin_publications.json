We analyze the time expressions from four datasets and find that only a small group of words are used to express time information, and the words in time expressions demonstrate similar syntactic behaviour.

Specifically, we define three main syntactic token types, namely time token, modifier, and numeral, to group time-related regular expressions over tokens. On the types we design general heuristic rules to recognize time expressions. In recognition, SynTime first identifies the time tokens from raw text, then searches their surroundings for modifiers and numerals to form time segments, and finally merges the time segments to time expressions. As a light-weight rule-based tagger, SynTime runs in real time, and can be easily expanded by simply adding keywords for the text of different types and of different domains.

In this work, we address the NLVL from a new perspective, i.e., span-based question answering (QA), by treating the input video as a text passage.

In this approach a tag is considered more relevant to its annotated image (also known as the seed image) if the tag is also used to annotate the neighbor images (nearest neighbors by visual similarity). However, the state-of-the-art approach that realizes the neighbor voting scheme does not explore the possibility of exploiting the content (e.g., degree of visual similarity between the seed and neighbor images) and contextual (e.g., tag association by co-occurrence) features of social images to further boost the accuracy of TagIR.

In such systems, users are more likely to ask questions on unfamiliar topics and to answer questions matching their expertise. Users can also vote answers based on their judgements.

Specifically, we used the Terrorism Knowledge Base (TKB) developed by experts at MIPT. We identified 409 Wikipedia articles matching TKB records, and went ahead to study them from three aspects: creation, revision, and link evolution. We found that the knowledge building in Wikipedia had largely been independent, and did not follow TKB - despite the open and online availability of the latter, as well as awareness of at least some of the Wikipedia contributors about the TKB\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wyKGVKUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=wyKGVKUAAAAJ:oQ8ZOKt5vhAC": {"external_link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08559", "authors": ["Yubo Ma", "Yixin Cao", "YongChing Hong", "Aixin Sun"], "publication_date": "2023/3/15", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.08559", "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks.

This paper aims to provide a thorough answer to this problem, and moreover, to explore an approach towards effective and economical IE systems that combine the strengths of LLMs and SLMs. Through extensive experiments on eight datasets across three IE tasks, we show that LLMs are not effective few-shot information extractors in general, given their unsatisfactory performance in most settings and the high latency and budget requirements. However, we demonstrate that LLMs can well complement SLMs and effectively solve hard samples that SLMs struggle with. Building on these findings, we propose an adaptive filter-then-rerank paradigm, in which SLMs act as filters and LLMs act as rerankers. By utilizing LLMs to rerank a small portion of difficult samples identified by SLMs, our preliminary system consistently achieves promising improvements (2.1% F1-gain on average) on various IE tasks, with acceptable cost of time and money.", "total_citations": {"2023": 19}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wyKGVKUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=wyKGVKUAAAAJ:QC-2xSqExF4C": {"external_link": "https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24096", "authors": ["Xin Zheng", "Aixin Sun"], "publication_date": "2019/2", "journal": "Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology", "volume": "70", "issue": "2", "pages": "176-186", "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "description": "Twitter provides a channel of collecting and publishing instant information on major events like natural disasters.

Lastly, a rule-based name normalization component maps a recognized name to its formal form.

Rather than modeling item representations as fixed vectors, we represent them as distributions in DiffuRec, which reflect user's multiple interests and item's various aspects adaptively. In diffusion phase, DiffuRec corrupts the target item embedding into a Gaussian distribution via noise adding, which is further applied for sequential item distribution representation generation and uncertainty injection. Afterwards, the item representation is fed into an Approximator for target item representation reconstruction.

Existing studies divide the task into two independent subproblems - initial group assignment and inter-group transfer. However, our study addresses both subproblems jointly using an end-to-end modeling approach. We first performed a preliminary analysis of half a million archived tickets to uncover relevant features. Then, we devised the UFTR, a Unified Framework for Ticket Routing using four types of features (derived from tickets, groups, and their interactions). In our experiments, we implemented two ranking models with the UFTR. Our models outperform baselines on three routing metrics. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis reveals that this superior performance can largely be attributed to the features that capture the associations between ticket assignment and group assignment.

This practice, known as screening prioritization (ie., document ranking approach), speeds up the process of conducting a SR as the documents labelled as relevant can move to the next tasks earlier. However, the approach is limited in reducing the manual workload because the total number of documents to screen remains the same. Towards reducing the manual workload in the screening process, we investigate the quality of document ranking of SR. This can signal researchers whereabouts in the ranking relevant studies are located and let them decide where to stop the screening. After extensive analysis on SR document rankings from different ranking models, we hypothesize 'topic broadness' as a factor that affects the ranking quality of SR.

In this study, we conduct a meticulous analysis on the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact on using the dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings from our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user interactions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens platform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affect the subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by the candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal recommendation algorithm(s). Removal of interactions that happen nearer to the last few interactions of a user leads to increasing difficulty in learning user preference, thus deteriorating recommendation accuracy. Third, changing the order of user interactions makes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive interaction process. Based on these findings, we further discuss the discrepancy between the interaction generation mechanism that is employed by the MovieLens system and that of typical real world recommendation scenarios.

On top of modeling the cross-modal interaction between candidate moments and the query, our proposed Moment Sampling DETR (MS-DETR) enables efficient moment-moment relation modeling. The core idea is to sample a subset of moments guided by the learnable templates with an adopted DETR (DEtection TRansformer) framework.

Some interactions are expected, because they largely follow users' long-term preferences. Some other interactions are indications of recent trends in user preference changes or marketing positions of new items. Accordingly, the recommender needs to be periodically retrained or updated to capture the new trends, and yet not to forget the long-term preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic retraining framework called Disentangled Incremental Learning (DIL) for graph-based recommenders. We assume that long-term preferences are well captured in the existing model, in the form of model parameters learned from past interactions. New preferences can be learned from the user-item bipartite graph constructed using the newly observed interactions. In DIL, we design an Information Extraction Module to extract historical preferences from the existing model. Then we blend the historical and new preferences in the form of node embeddings in the new graph, through a Disentanglement Module. The essence of the disentanglement module is to decorrelate the historical and new preferences so that both can be well captured, via carefully designed losses. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, we show the effectiveness of DIL in capturing dynamics of useritem interactions. We also demonstrate the robustness of DIL by attaching it to two base models - LightGCN and NGCF."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wyKGVKUAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=wyKGVKUAAAAJ:MRFs4rWx_PcC": {"external_link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03299", "authors": ["Kuicai Dong", "Aixin Sun", "Jung-Jae Kim", "Xiaoli Li"], "publication_date": "2023/5/5", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.03299", "description": "Open Information Extraction (OIE) aims to extract relational tuples from open-domain sentences.

Detecting risky (or bad) sellers on such a payment network is crucial to payment service providers for risk management and legal compliance. In this research, we formulate this task as a node classification task. Specifically, we aim to predict a label for each seller in a payment network, by analysing its properties and/or interactions. Nodes residing in different parts of a payment network can have similar local topology structures. Such local topology structures reveal sellers' business roles, eg., supplier, drop-shipper, or retailer. We note that many existing solutions for graph-based node classification only consider node connectivity but not the similarity between node's local topology structure. Motivated by business need, we present a dual-path graph convolution network, named DP-GCN, for node classification. DP-GCN considers both node connectivity and topology structure similarity. The proposed model consists of three main modules: (i) a C-GCN module to capture connectivity relationships between nodes, (ii) a T-GCN module to capture topology structure similarities between nodes, and (iii) a multi-head self-attention module to align both properties. We evaluate DP-GCN on seven benchmark datasets against diverse baselines.
