In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent evolutionary trust model (MET) where each buyer evolves its trust network. In each generation, each buyer acquires trust network information from its advisors and generates a candidate trust network using evolutionary operators. Only trust networks providing more accurate seller reputation estimation shall survive to the next generation.

The focus is on developing an approach for buyers to model the trustworthiness of sellers in order to make effective decisions about which sellers to select for business. One challenge is the problem of unfair ratings, which arises when modeling the trust of sellers relies on ratings provided by other buyers (called advisors). Existing approaches for coping with this problem fail in scenarios where the majority of advisors are dishonest, buyers do not have much personal experience with sellers, advisors try to flood the trust modeling system with unfair ratings, and sellers vary their behavior widely. We propose a novel personalized approach for effectively modeling trustworthiness of advisors, allowing a buyer to 1) model the private reputation of an advisor based on their ratings for commonly rated sellers 2) model the public reputation of the advisor based on all ratings for the sellers ever rated by that agent 3) flexibly weight the private and public reputation into one combined measure of the trustworthiness of the advisor. Our approach tracks ratings provided according to their time windows and limits the ratings accepted, in order to cope with advisors flooding the system and to deal with changes in agents' behavior. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our model outperforms other models in detecting dishonest advisors and is able to assist buyers to gain the largest profit when doing business with sellers.

In this paper, we propose a trust-oriented mechanism built on a game theoretic basis for buyers to: (1) determine an optimal seller reporting strategy, by modeling the trustworthiness (competency and willingness) of advisers in reporting seller information; (2) discover sellers who maximize their profit by modeling the\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFV_RdMAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=IFV_RdMAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3460231.3474239", "authors": ["Danni Peng", "Sinno Jialin Pan", "Jie Zhang", "Anxiang Zeng"], "publication_date": "2021/9/13", "book": "Fifteenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems", "pages": "411-421", "description": "Recommender Systems (RSs) in real-world applications often deal with billions of user interactions daily.

Proactive scheduling can effectively cope with the duration uncertainties, by generating robust baseline solutions according to a priori stochastic knowledge. However, most of the existing proactive approaches assume that the duration uncertainty of an activity is not related to its scheduled start time, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we relax this assumption by allowing the duration uncertainty to be time-dependent, which is caused by the uncertainty of whether the activity can be executed on each time slot. We propose a stochastic optimization model to find an optimal Partial-order Schedule (POS) that minimizes the expected makespan. This model can cover both the time-dependent uncertainty studied in this paper and the traditional time-independent duration uncertainty. To circumvent the underlying complexity in evaluating a given solution, we approximate the stochastic optimization model based on Sample Average Approximation (SAA).

The first challenge is that TRM is built on evidence (direct or indirect observations) but evidence is becoming increasingly sparse because nowadays users have many more venues to share information. This makes it hard to derive trust models that are robust to attacks such as whitewashing and Sybil attacks. Second, the cost of attacks has reduced significantly due to the widespread presence of bots in e-commerce applications, which tends to invalidate the traditional assumption that majority users are honest. In this paper, we propose a new TRM framework called BEQA, which uses Blockchain to transform multiple disjoint and sparse sets of evidence into a single and dense evidence set. To address the second challenge, we introduce and formulate the cost of Sybil attacks using Blockchain transaction fees. In addition, we make a key observation that existing trust models have overlooked publicity (evidence originating from influencers) that exist in e-commerce applications. Thus, we formulate publicity as a whitewashing deposit such that a higher level of publicity will impose higher cost on Sybil attacks.", "total_citations": {"2022": 3, "2023": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=IFV_RdMAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=IFV_RdMAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8765826/", "authors": ["Dongxia Wang", "Tim Muller", "Jie Zhang", "Yang Liu"], "publication_date": "2019/7/18", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "volume": "15", "pages": "816-828", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce.

Currently, buyer impressions in e-commerce are allocated through a highly complex ranking system which selects top-k sellers based on their quality scores and how good they can match buyers\u2019 queries and preferences [17, 20]. In reality, more buyer impressions often give rise to more sales, and the ranking system often prefers popular sellers as they can potentially bring more sales for the platform. Thus, with the goal of increasing sales, some sellers fraudulently boost their popularity by, for example, hiring a group of human labors to visit their shops frequently or buy items from their shops and give good feedbacks [19]. In this way, these fraud sellers can gain unfair advantages over others, which jeopardizes the business environment of the platform. To keep the market fair, the platform must take away some buyer impressions from these fraud sellers. On the other hand, these fraud sellers also contribute a certain amount of normal transactions to the platform. In addition, the fraud detection techniques used to identify fraud sellers are possible to make false positive decisions. Hence, reducing the buyer impressions of fraud sellers too much may mistakenly kill some normal transactions, which will cause the total transactions of the platform to decline. With all these factors considered, it is a long-standing challenge for e-commerce platforms to find a proper policy to regulate the buyer impressions of fraud sellers.

We formulate the algorithmic procedure of generic ODAs as a Markov decision process, and parameterize the policy (reduction rule) with a novel two-stage GNN to fuse information from variables, constraints and especially objectives for better state representation. We train our model with imitation learning and deploy it on a state-of-the-art ODA. Results show that our method significantly improves the solving efficiency of the ODA.

However, this encounters an accuracy-privacy dilemma as we identify in this paper, and we propose a framework called Context-aware Bernoulli Neural Network based Reputation Assessment (COBRA) to address this challenge. COBRA encapsulates agent interactions or transactions, which are prone to privacy leak, in machine learning models, and aggregates multiple such models using a Bernoulli neural network to predict a trust score for an agent.

Besides, there are inherited trust problems in virtual marketplaces. For instance, some sellers may be dishonest (eg, fail to deliver items as what they promised), or some sellers may have different competency (eg, provide only low quality products). In order to address the trust problem in virtual marketplaces, a fivesense oriented feedback provision approach has been proposed in our previous work [3]. The basic idea is to allow buyers to share their past experience about sellers in their feedback based on human buyers\u2019 five senses, namely, vision, sound, touch, taste and smell. Then, the reputation of sellers can be modeled based on the shared feedback. Information about five senses is synthesized by virtual reality simulators.
