In this paper, we propose Federated Opportunistic Computing for Ubiquitous Systems (FOCUS) to address this challenge. It maintains a small set of benchmark samples on the FL server and quantifies the credibility of the client local data without directly observing them by computing the mutual cross-entropy between performance of the FL model on the local datasets and that of the client local FL model on the benchmark dataset. Then, a credit weighted orchestration is performed to adjust the weight assigned to clients in the FL model based on their credibility values. FOCUS has been experimentally evaluated on both synthetic data and real-world data. The results show that it effectively identifies clients with noisy labels and reduces their impact on the model performance, thereby significantly outperforming existing FL approaches.", "total_citations": {"2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 19, "2023": 13}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC": {"external_link": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hao-Zhang-196/publication/325735164_Familiarity_Design_in_Exercise_Games_for_Elderly/links/606286cb458515e8347d8794/Familiarity-Design-in-Exercise-Games-for-Elderly.pdf", "authors": ["Hao Zhang", "Zhiqi Shen", "Jun Lin", "Yiqiang Chen", "Yuan Miao"], "publication_date": "2016", "journal": "International Journal of Information Technology", "volume": "22", "issue": "2", "description": "Rehabilitation exergames aim to help the elderly recover from their deteriorated capabilities due to aging. Research suggests that exercise games (exergames) may effectively engage the elderly in physical activities. However, new technologies and devices normally used to develop the exergames may be over complex and difficult for the elderly to use, mainly because the hardware and software components involved in modern exergames appear unfamiliar or even alien to the elderly mentally. Moreover, the elderly consider the investment to acquire the unfamiliar technology is too high. Therefore, the study of familiarity issues of the elderly is important and necessary to guide the interaction design of new technologies so that they can be built upon the elderly's prior knowledge of real world interactions to help the elderly to apply their existing skills to a new domain. In this paper, we propose three dimensions of familiarity design and the approach to design familiar exergames for the elderly. By following this approach, we hope to increase the usability of the exergames that the elderly can naturally interact with.

In these environments, relationships among agents are often formed through trust. Accurately estimating the degree of trust between agents is important in this case as social relationships are frequently leveraged to recommend products or services. Existing social trust models often utilize rating similarity between different agents to calculate how much they should trust each other.

However, so far, the available games developed for PD are mostly intended for rehabilitation purposes. PD diagnosis still depends on the traditional neurological exams and experience of doctors, which require the patients to become self-aware of the symptoms and are usually too late for the patients to delay the progression of PD.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments.

To tackle this issue, this paper studies how to produce the true relevance labels for< query, URL> pairs using clickthrough data. By analyzing the correlations between query frequency, true relevance labels and users\u2019 behaviors, we demonstrate that the users who search the queries with similar frequency have similar search intents and behavioral characteristics. Based on such properties, we propose an efficient discriminative parameter estimation in a multiple instance learning algorithm (MIL) to automatically produce true relevance labels for< query, URL> pairs. Furthermore, we test our approach using a set of real world data extracted from a Chinese commercial search engine.

However, state-of-the-art models enhance the dyadic relations between users and items by considering either user-user or item-item relations, leaving the high-order relations of the other side (i.e., users or items) unexplored.

Contrastive learning has recently shown its promising representation learning capability in the absence of expert annotations. However, existing contrastive approaches generally treat each instance independently, which leads to false negative pairs that share the same semantics. To tackle this problem, we propose MHCCL, a Masked Hierarchical Cluster-wise Contrastive Learning model, which exploits semantic information obtained from the hierarchical structure consisting of multiple latent partitions for multivariate time series. Motivated by the observation that fine-grained clustering preserves higher purity while coarse-grained one reflects higher-level semantics, we propose a novel downward masking strategy to filter out fake negatives and supplement positives by incorporating the multi-granularity information from the clustering hierarchy. In addition, a novel upward masking strategy is designed in MHCCL to remove outliers of clusters at each partition to refine prototypes, which helps speed up the hierarchical clustering process and improves the clustering quality. We conduct experimental evaluations on seven widely-used multivariate time series datasets.

A large scale MAS may have billions of possible ways of organization, depending on the number of agents, the roles, and the relationships among these agents. These characteristics make it impractical to find an optimal choice of organization using exhaustive search methods. In this report, we propose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing hierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm, called the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with a repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic hierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array representation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operatorliterate. A case study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is provided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which lead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. Compared with the traditional genetic operators, the newly introduced operators produced better organizations of higher utility more consistently in a variety of test cases.

In simulation, a sequence of events with attributes, such as priorities and amounts of time needed to process the events, is input to the agent at designed insertion time. The events are processed by the agent according to the attributes. The statistics of processing time can be recorded. Then we make some theoretical analysis to estimate the average response time when an agent processes a sequence of events based on probability and queueing theory.

We introduce a novel algorithm, called the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with a repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic hierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array representation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operator-literate. A case study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is provided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which lead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search.

Additionally, these approaches often overlook the significance of the temporal fluctuation in item popularity that can sway users' decision-making. To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems. Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial applications and a valuable baseline for future research."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10248265/", "authors": ["Shipeng Wang", "Qingzhong Li", "Lizhen Cui", "Yali Jiang", "Zhiqi Shen", "Han Yu"], "publication_date": "2023/7/2", "conference": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "pages": "161-169", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "The increasing popularity of crowdsourcing has resulted in the emergence of multiple crowdsourcing service providers (CSPs), such as Mechnical Turk and Crowdflower, which compete to attract crowd workers (CWs).

Its main objective is to predict the user's next interested POI based on her previous check-in information. Most existing methods directly use users' historical check-in trajectories to construct various graphs to assist sequential models to complete this task. However, as users' check-in data is extremely sparse, it is difficult to capture the potential relations between POIs by directly using these check-in data. To this end, we propose the Sequence-based Neighbour search and Prediction Model (SNPM) for next POI recommendation. In SNPM, the RotatE knowledge graph embedding and Eigenmap methods are used to extract POI relationships implied in check-in data, and build the POI similarity graph. Then, we enhance the model's generalized representations of POIs' general features by aggregating similar POIs. As the context is typically rich and valuable when making Next POI predictions, the sequence model selects which POIs to aggregate not only depends on the current state, but also needs to consider the previous POI sequence. Therefore, we construct a Sequence-based, Dynamic Neighbor Graph (SDNG) to find the similarity neighbourhood and develop a Multi-Step Dependency Prediction model (MSDP) inspired by RotatE, which explicitly leverage information from previous states.

Moreover, prevailing methods adopt computation-intensive frameworks, such as flow-based models and Markov chains, which take plenty of time and resources in the training phase. To resolve these limitations, this paper proposes a unified style-aware network architecture combining both point-wise distance loss and adversarial loss, StarNet which is able to reconstruct and generate high-fidelity and even 3D point clouds using a mapping network that can effectively disentangle the Gaussian prior from input's high-level attributes in the mapped latent space to generate realistic interpolated objects.

Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing classification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric learning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper, we bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance Selection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the probability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples. Specifically, we propose a novel method, namely the von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity (vMF-Sim), to calculate this probability by estimating a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution for each data class. Compared with the existing average similarity method (AvgSim), vMF-Sim considers the variance of each class in addition to the average similarity. With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the proposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the best performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable training time."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8153398321088895117&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Zhengxiang Pan", "Yaming Zhang", "Hao Zhang", "Zhiqi Shen", "Xi Jessie Yang"], "publication_date": "2021", "journal": "International Journal of Information Technology", "volume": "27", "issue": "2", "description": "Creating a healthy ageing society is taking priority in recent years.

The wireless systems equipped with the new resource allocation scheme behave with strong robustness with respect to the change of the correlation coefficient.
