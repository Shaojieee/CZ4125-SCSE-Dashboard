Big volumes of various GPS-based travel data can be easily collected, among which the taxi GPS trajectory data is a typical example. However, in GPS trajectory data, there is usually little information on travelers' activities, thereby they can only support limited applications. Quite a few studies have been focused on enriching the semantic meaning for raw data, such as travel mode/purpose inferring. Unfortunately, trip purpose imputation receives relatively less attention and requires no real-time response. To narrow the gap, we propose a probabilistic two-phase framework named TripImputor, for making the real-time taxi trip purpose imputation and recommending services to passengers at their dropoff points.
