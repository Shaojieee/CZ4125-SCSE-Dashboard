Many approaches address the issue of unlabelled datasets by tightly coupling machine learning algorithms with interactive visualisations. Using appropriate techniques, analysts can play an active role in a highly interactive and iterative machine learning process to label the dataset and create meaningful partitions. While this principle has been implemented either for unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised machine learning tasks, the combination of all three methodologies remains challenging. In this paper, a visual analytics approach is presented, combining a variety of machine learning capabilities with four linked visualisation views, all integrated within the mVis (multivariate Visualiser) system. The available palette of techniques allows an analyst to perform exploratory data analysis on a multivariate dataset and divide it into meaningful labelled partitions, from which a classifier can be built. In the workflow, the analyst can label interesting patterns or outliers in a semi-supervised process supported by active learning. Once a dataset has been interactively labelled, the analyst can continue the workflow with supervised machine learning to assess to what degree the subsequent classifier has effectively learned the concepts expressed in the labelled training dataset. Using a novel technique called automatic dimension selection, interactions the analyst had with dimensions of the multivariate dataset are used to steer the machine learning algorithms.

Virtual simulation of arthroscopy becomes an extremely important training tool that allows the medical students to acquire necessary motor skills before they can approach real patients.

As a result, when teaching subjects richly infused with geometry and mathematics it is usually a challenge for the learners to follow the instructor and visualize how mathematical concepts reflect in 3D geometry and colors. We have proposed an approach that allows for defining geometry, visual appearance and tangible physical properties of virtual objects by using mathematical formulas. It allows the learners to get immersed within the 3D scene and explore the shapes which are being modeled visually and haptically. We illustrate this concept with our function-based extension of X3D and VRML. Besides definition of objects with mathematical functions straight in the scene file, standard X3D and VRML objects can be converted into tangible ones as well as augmented with function-defined visual appearances. Since the function-defined models are small in size, it is possible to perform their collaborative interactive modifications with concurrent synchronous visualization at each client computer with any required level of detail which we illustrate with an interactive modeling tool used in education in our university."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C": {"external_link": "https://ijvr.eu/article/view/2786", "authors": ["Mingyong Pang", "Alexei Sourin", "Zhigeng Pan"], "publication_date": "2010/1/1", "journal": "International Journal of Virtual Reality", "volume": "9", "issue": "4", "pages": "13-19", "description": "In this paper we present a novel algorithm for constructing subdivision connectivity mesh from dense original mesh.

For each mesh patch, four boundary condition curves are calculated via the parameterization for local PDE patch construction. Considering the boundary curves as shape control boundary curve conditions, a PDE patch can be built and its coefficients are evaluated from the boundary curves.

In particular, we discuss how function based PDE surfaces can be readily integrated within VRML and X3D environments."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC": {"external_link": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812708823_0008", "authors": ["BU-SUNG LEE", "ALEXEI SOURIN", "CLEMENT CHIA LIANG TIEN", "CHAN KAI YUAN", "TERENCE HUNG", "QUOC-THUAN HO", "JIE WEI", "DANNY OH", "STEVEN MILLER", "JUNWEI ZHANG", "ANTHONY CHONG", "K LEVINSKI"], "publication_date": "2007", "book": "GCA 2007", "pages": "91-103", "description": "Rendering of images is a very compute intensive task.

The model depends on a representative physical property of the alveolar region termed the effective diffusivity, a function of the diffusivity, solubility, morphology and interface topography of each alveolar constituent. Unfortunately, the direct determination of the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region is impractical because of the difficulty in describing the internal geometry of each alveolar constituent. However, the transient solution of the macroscopic model can be used in conjunction with the lung-diffusing capacity (measured in a clinical setting) to determine the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region. With the effective diffusivity known, the three-dimensional effects of red blood-cell distribution on the lung-diffusing capacity can be predicted via numerical simulations. The results, obtained for normal (random), uniform, center-cluster, cornercluster, and several chain-like distributions, reveal a strong relationship between the type of red-cell distribution and the lung-diffusing capacity. The model developed has been used in order to study the impact of microscopic particles whose presence in the alveolar region may affect the lung-diffusing capacity. Clusters of particles were distributed according to the Poisson distribution with a different distribution parameter (the average number of particles per cluster)."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC": {"external_link": "https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/encyclopedia-virtual-communities-technologies/18127", "authors": ["Alexei Sourin"], "publication_date": "2006", "book": "Encyclopedia of Virtual Communities and Technologies", "pages": "478-481", "publisher": "IGI Global", "description": "Nanyang in Chinese means \u201csouth seas\u201d \u00bea reference to the Southeast Asian region.

These initial conditions can significantly vary depending on the flow conditions in the conductive zone of the respiratory duct and the physical properties of the duct itself.  Thus, for instance, the presence of solid micro-particles or other volatile components in the breathing air can affect the alveolar performance.  Therefore, a numerical simulation of the \"two-phase\" air flow is necessary in order to determine the entrance conditions in the alveolar region.

As a result, when teaching subjects richly infused with geometry and mathematics it is usually a challenge for the learners to follow the instructor and visualize how mathematical concepts reflect in 3D geometry and colors. We have proposed an approach that allows for defining geometry, visual appearance and tangible physical properties of virtual objects by using mathematical formulas. It allows the learners to get immersed within the 3D scene and explore the shapes which are being modeled visually and haptically. We illustrate this concept with our function-based extension of X3D and VRML.

We illustrate this concept by developing software which allows us to touch and feel surfaces of VRML and X3D objects, convert them to solid objects as well as create any other solid objects using the function-based extension of VRML and X3D. We define geometry, appearance and density of the solid objects by implicit, explicit and parametric functions straight in the VRML/X3D code or in dynamic-link libraries.

Virtual simulation of arthroscopy is an extremely important training tool that allows the medical students to acquire necessary motor skills before they can approach real patients. We propose how to achieve visually realistic deformation of the virtual meniscus by using linear co-rotational finite element method applied to the coarse mesh enriched with monitor points responsible for fine wrinkles simulation. The simulation is performed in real time and it closely follows the actual meniscus deformation. The generated wrinkles are easily adjustable and do not require large memory."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6980734/", "authors": ["Qunshen Peng", "Wei Peng", "Rami Qahwaji", "Vladimir Savchenko", "Andrei Sherstyuk", "Mikio Shinya", "Michio Shiraishi", "Alexei Sourin", "Olga Sourina", "Maki Sugimoto", "Bongwon Suh", "Hiroki Takahashi", "Daniel Thalmann", "Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann", "Hassan Ugail", "Bodo Urban", "Krzysztof Walczak", "Guoping Wang", "Phil Willis", "Franz-Erich Wolter", "Adam Westerski", "Anna Wu", "Brian Wyvill", "Norimasa Yoshida", "Qingshu Yuan", "Jiri Zara", "Hongbin Zha"], "description": "Provides a listing of current committee members and society officers."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6337445/", "authors": ["Alexei Sourin"], "description": "Presents the title page of the proceedings."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15986921944731337866&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Lai Feng Min", "Alexei Sourin", "Konstantin Levinski"], "description": "This paper describes how the web visualization can be greatly improved using the function-based shape modeling technique. The improvement is possible because the proposed function-defined VRML shape node allows the content creators to describe any complex models with relatively small functions compared to the large-size polygonal mesh based VRML nodes. These functiondefined shapes can be used together with the common VRML shapes. The proposed node has a few implementations capable of visualizing geometric shapes defined with HyperFun language as well as in any proprietary function-defined data format. For fast visualization of the function-defined shapes, we have developed an improved continuation polygonization algorithm specifically designed for VRML visualization. The design, the implementation details, and the application examples of the proposed node are discussed."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15596532303447277500&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Konstantin Levinski", "Alexei Sourin"], "description": "This paper addresses virtual function-based shape modeling where relatively small formulas are used rather than thousands of polygons. Interactive modification of the function model with concurrent visualization of the respective polygonal mesh lets us provide both the interactivity and any required level of detail leading to photo-realistic appearance of the resulting shapes. We have proposed a rendering method capable of handling local shape modifications with any desired precision on a personal computer. Also, we have proposed a few methods, which let us accelerate the final function evaluation\u2014a common bottleneck for the function-based shape modeling. Finally, we describe applications of the interactive function-based shape modeling to photorealistic virtual embossing and carving."}}
