BACKGROUND For safety-critical embedded systems, an increasing trend is to integrate multiple independent functionalities on a single shared computing platform; this trend is evident in industry-driven initiatives and standards such as ARINC653 [1] and IMA and AUTOSAR [2] in automotive. However among all the functionalities in a system, only some functionalities are critical for the correctness of the system and need to be certificated by statutory certification authorities (CAs) and the rest of the functionalities will not influence the safety of the system to the same extent. Under normal conditions, all tasks providing different functionalities will receive enough processing resource. But more critical tasks should be given preference if something abnormal happens in the system (ie when tasks exceed their expected worst-case execution times (WECTs)[3] which in fact is highly unlikely to happen). Such systems comprised of tasks of different criticalities are called mixed-criticality (MC) systems. In many previous studies of mixed-criticality real-time systems, the model proposed by Vestal is widely used [3]. In this model, a task can be specified as \u0442i=(Ti, Li, ci, Di), where Ti denotes minimum separation between job releases, Li denotes criticality level based on the task\u2019s importance to the system, ci= c1 i, c2 i,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, cmax i is a list of WCET values measured with different degrees of confidence (here cj i denotes \u0442i\u2019s WCET when the system is at criticality level j), and Di (\uf8ff Ti) denotes \u0442i\u2019s deadline.

Each component consists of some real-time workload and a scheduling policy for the workload. To simplify schedulability analysis for such systems, analysis can be done compositionally using interfaces that abstract the timing requirements of components. To facilitate analysis of dynam-ically changing real-time systems, the framework must support incremental analysis.

To support incremental analysis and resource bandwidth minimization, we describe an extension to this interface model.

Although there are existing self-driving algorithms for the Duckietown platform, they are either too complex or perform too poorly to navigate a multi-lane track. Moreover, it is essential to give memory and computational resources to a Duckiebot so it can perform additional tasks such as out-of-distribution input detection. In order to satisfy these constraints, we built a low-cost autonomous driving algorithm capable of driving on a two-lane track. The algorithm uses traditional computer vision techniques to identify the central lane on the track and obtain the relevant steering angle. The steering is then controlled by a PID controller that smoothens the movement of the Duckiebot. The performance of the algorithm was compared to that of the NeurIPS 2018 AI Driving Olympics (AIDO) finalists, and it outperformed all but one finalists. The two main contributions of our algorithm are its low computational requirements and very quick set-up, with ongoing efforts to make it more reliable."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=B_ouhTgAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=B_ouhTgAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9632317/", "authors": ["Nitin Shivaraman", "Jakob Fittler", "Saravanan Ramanathan", "Arvind Easwaran", "Sebastian Steinhorst"], "publication_date": "2021/10/25", "conference": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)", "pages": "301-307", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid.

However, a single resilience manager, placed at the centre of the system to deal with every fault, suffers from decision-making overburden; and therefore, is out of the question for distributed large-scale CPS. On the other hand, prompt detection of failures and efficient recovery from them are challenging for decentralised resilience managers. In this regard, we present a novel resilience management framework that utilises the concept of management hierarchy.

An important challenge in designing MCS is to handle uncertainties in the execution behaviour such as a budget overrun of a software element (or task) in a safe and effective manner. For this purpose, functional safety standards such as ISO 26262 [1] specify a set of rules and rigorous process which necessitate the system design to incorporate sufficient mechanisms to prevent the propagation of faults from tasks certified to lower criticality level to tasks certified to higher criticality level. A majority of the existing MCS task models (reviewed in [2]) consider criticality to denote the relative importance of a task and use it to achieve graceful degradation of the system either by suspending or degrading tasks with relatively lower criticality level than the overloading task. As pointed out in [3], notion of criticality as the relative importance of a task may be appropriate only for dual-criticality MCS models (where a task can be either high critical or low critical). For instance, it has been observed that in a system with 4 criticality levels, to handle budget overrun of any task at criticality level 4 (highest), degradation of tasks with criticality level 3 may not be acceptable. As stated in [4], the notion of criticality, relative importance and degradation of a functionality in an MCS should be loosely coupled entities. To achieve this, we consider a context-aware degradation strategy with the following\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=B_ouhTgAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=B_ouhTgAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC": {"external_link": "https://www.academia.edu/download/59106962/mco20181120190502-45151-qcbnap.pdf", "authors": ["Mohammad Shihabul Haque", "Daniel Jun Xian Ng", "Arvind Easwaran"], "publication_date": "2019/1/15", "description": "Cyber-physical Systems SG tisfy User requirements through ClOSe COllCbOrGflOn GmOng physicGl Gnd Cyber COmponents.

DaCO delivers these improvements with a custom instruction datapath that exploits the raw parallelism exposed by the dataflow triggering rule - instructions execute asynchronously as soon as their operands are available. However, this simple triggering logic can expose large amounts of irregular instruction-level parallelism that can be hard to manage. This thesis addresses this challenge in three steps: (1) design of a lightweight scheduling circuit inside each DaCO soft-processor that enables large- scale out-of-order instruction execution at runtime, (2) design of a priority-aware communication framework that delivers improved quality of service to critical communication packets, and (3) compiler support that optimizes the dataflow graph structure for improved runtime execution. DaCO is optimized for the Arria 10 AX115S (20nm SoC) FPGA board in order to take advantage of the hard on-chip floating-point DSP blocks. Overall, when benchmarked with sparse-matrix vector multiply kernels, DaCO improves throughput performance by up to 2.4x over existing in-order dataflow overlays, and delivers a peak operational throughput of up to 38 MFLOPs/processor, or a peak total throughput of 3.5 GFLOPs/sec.

However, it remains a challenge for DCNN\u2019s performance to be robust when inputs are maliciously manipulated or out-of-distribution. This paper explores a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based data augmentation technique to train adversarially robust DCNN models. We show that, under a mixture of different types of adversarial attacks, the classification accuracy of a CIFAR100 model trained with the proposed data augmentation method is 8.8% higher than the best model on the RobustBench leaderboard. As simple as SVD is, it effectively alleviates adversarial perturbations from images during testing. We show that under miscellaneous adversarial attacks, SVD based input defense method improves the accuracy of robust ImageNet models on the RobustBench leaderboard by 4-6%, the best among existing input defense methods in comparison."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=B_ouhTgAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=B_ouhTgAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C": {"external_link": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/ecrts/2010/05562891/12OmNrF2DM9", "authors": ["Luca Abeni", "Masud Ahmed", "Bader Al-Ahmad", "Luis Almeida", "Mikael \u00c5sberg", "Neil Audsley", "Philip Axer", "Paulo Baltarejo Sousa", "Mario Bambagini", "Laura Barros Bastante", "Tseesuren Batsuuri", "Moris Behnam", "Sven Buente", "Julie Chambon", "Bekim Cilku", "Rodrigo Coehlo", "Dakshina Dasari", "Farhana Dewan", "Robert Diemer", "Benedikt Dietrich", "Bjoern Doebel", "Arvind Easwaran", "Christian El Salloum", "Benjamin Engel", "Dario Faggioli", "Daniele Fontanelli", "Torsten Frenzel", "Shelby Funk", "Joe Gaudet", "Martin Geier", "Jo\u00ebl Goossens", "Raphael Guerra", "Mike Holenderski", "Benedikt Huber", "Giancarlo Iannizzotto", "Matthias Ivers", "Petr Jurcik", "Roland Kammerer", "Susanne Kandl", "Ugur Keskin", "Anis Koubaa", "Jinkyu Lee", "Minsub Lee", "Benjamin Lesage", "Xue Liu", "Yue Lu", "Anwar Mamat", "Ricardo Marau", "Jos\u00e9 Marinho", "Alejandro Masrur", "Anand Meher", "Meha Mehta", "Patrick Meumeu Yomsi", "Pierre Michaud", "Sibin Mohan", "Theepan Moorthy", "Mircea Negrean", "Vincent N\u00e9lis", "Farhang Nemati", "Luis Nogueira", "Daniel Medina Ortega", "Javier Orozco", "Jos\u00e9 Carlos Palencia", "Wolfgang Puffitsch", "Paul Regnier", "Michael Roitzsch", "Keivan Ronasi", "Jonas Rox", "Luca Santinelli", "Abhik Sarkar", "Martin Sch\u00e4fer", "Simon Schliecker", "Reinhard Schneider", "Stefan Schorr", "Maurice Sebastian", "Ramon Serna", "Michal Sojka", "Ondrej Spinka", "Julian Stecklina", "Udo Steinberg", "Premysl Sucha", "Maliha Sultana", "Emanuele Toscano", "Jiri Trdlicka", "Luca Valcarenghi", "Cuong Viet", "Shaohui Wang", "Yunbo Wang", "Armin Wasicek", "Libor Waszniowski", "Carsten Weinhold", "Jack Whitham"], "description": "list-reviewer Toggle navigation IEEE Computer Society Digital Library Jobs Tech News \nResource Center Press Room Advertising About Us IEEE IEEE Computer Society IEEE \nComputer Society Digital Library My Subscriptions Magazines Journals Conference Proceedings \nInstitutional Subscriptions IEEE IEEE Computer Society More Jobs Tech News Resource \nCenter Press Room Advertising About Us Cart All Advanced Search Conference Cover Image \nDownload 1.Home 2.Proceedings 3.ecrts 2010 list-reviewer 2010, pp. xi-xi, DOI Bookmark: \n10.1109/ECRTS.2010.6 Keywords Authors Abstract The conference offers a note of thanks and \nlists its reviewers.

We welcome you in the Mediterranean city of Valencia to spend an exciting time for science and also social gathering around the conference themes.Since its origin back in 1998, ISORC addresses the most interesting topics around real-time applications, object-oriented and component technology for distributed systems, and distribution middleware design. The conference has evolved over the years to address the many emerging challenges that new applications and systems bring to the scientific and technological arena. This event requires the involvement of a number of people that we wish to thank individually. In the first place, we warmly thank the PC chairs, Aniruddha Gokhale, Weichen Liu, and Mathias Pacher for their effort and time in putting together an outstanding pool of reviewers and for handling the review process of the submitted contributions to select the final set of papers that will be presented. Also, we want to thank the Poster/Demo chairs, Prof. Luis Lino Ferreira and Di Liu, who have organized a track on posters and demos for the first time in ISORC.
