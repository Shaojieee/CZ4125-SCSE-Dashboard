He has been actively involved with the Asia-Pacific research and education network since the formation of Singapore Advance Research and Education Network(SingAREN). He is the founding president of SingAREN society, 2003-2007, and is currently the President of SingAREN(2011-2015).  Since 2004, he is a member of the technical management team of Trans-Eurasia Information Network (TEIN-2); the first large scale is the first large-scale research and education network for the Asia-Pacific. It connects ten countries in the region, and provides direct connectivity to Europe\u2019s G\u00c9ANT2 network.  His involvements continue into the new phase of the project TEIN-3 and TEIN-4. He was elected the founding Chair of the governors of the Trans-Eurasia Information Network Cooperation Center(TEIN*CC), in May 2012,  which manages the TEIN-4 project.  Bu-Sung Lee has published over 300 peer preview conference papers, and 100 journal papers. His research areas cover both Grid/Cloud Computing and network. Lately he has carried out research in the area of application of Data Analytics and Big Data.  He has received a number of research grants. He is the co-author of a number of papers that has won Best Paper awards and demonstration award.  He has given numerous Invited/Keynote address in conferences and played an active role in the academic community in organizing conferences.Bu-Sung Lee, has been awarded numerous grants over the years. In early 2014, he successfully completed the A*STAR thematic grants \u201cUser and Domain Driven Data Analytics as a Service framework\u201d.  The project developed a data analytics platform using Cloud resources and applied it to energy efficiency in building.", "interests": "Grid/Cloud Computing especially in the area of scheduling and scalability in data intensive application.
