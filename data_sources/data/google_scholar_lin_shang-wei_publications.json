In this paper, we study this problem from the viewpoint of adversarial attack and identify a totally new task, i.e., adversarial exposure attack generating adversarial images by tuning image exposure to mislead the DNNs with significantly high transferability. To this end, we first implement a straightforward method, i.e., multiplicative-perturbation-based exposure attack, and reveal the big challenges of this new task. Then, to make the adversarial image naturalness, we propose the adversarial bracketed exposure fusion that regards the exposure attack as an element-wise bracketed exposure fusion problem in the Laplacian-pyramid space. Moreover, to realize high transferability, we further propose the convolutional bracketed exposure fusion where the element-wise multiplicative operation is extended to the convolution. We validate our method on the real public DR dataset with the advanced DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, showing our method can achieve high image quality and success rate of the transfer attack. Our method reveals the potential threats to the DNN-based DR automated diagnosis and can definitely benefit the development of exposure-robust automated DR diagnosis method in the future.", "total_citations": {"2020": 5, "2021": 12, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sCbkO2oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=sCbkO2oAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC": {"external_link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109819305692", "authors": ["Yuan Zhou", "Hesuan Hu", "Yang Liu", "Shang-Wei Lin", "Zuohua Ding"], "publication_date": "2020/2/1", "journal": "Automatica", "volume": "112", "pages": "108706", "publisher": "Pergamon", "description": "Deadlock avoidance is a crucial problem in motion control of multi-robot systems since deadlocks can crash the systems and\u2215 or degrade their performance.

Thus, there are many works trying to speedup the process of SAT/SMT solving. In this work, we develop a framework by proposing a new hardware architecture to solve the SMT problem for the theory of Quantifier free Linear Real Arithmetic (QF-LRA) to speedup the SMT solving process. The new proposed architecture framework consists of a hardware SAT solver and a hardware Simplex solver. Our hardware SAT solver has an optimized BCP process with a pipeline structure and a non-chronological backtracking mechanism, while our hardware Simplex solver supports parallel operation flow inside the Simplex iteration to execute the selection operations parallelly with the pivot operation and the row selection mechanism to avoid unnecessary\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sCbkO2oAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=sCbkO2oAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C": {"external_link": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12133/121330I/Dynamic-assertion-for-quantum-circuits-based-on-stabilizers/10.1117/12.2632655.short", "authors": ["Chen-yuan Lin", "Shang-Wei Lin", "Yean-Ru Chen"], "publication_date": "2022/5/31", "conference": "Quantum Technologies 2022", "volume": "12133", "pages": "103-108", "publisher": "SPIE", "description": "Quantum computing is computationally more powerful than classical one due to the features of superposition and entanglement of quantum bits (qubits). However, because of the non-cloning property, measuring qubits in superposition forces them to collapse onto classical ones, which makes traditional run-time techniques for debugging and analyzing hardware circuits infeasible. To overcome this issue, previous works proposed the concept of quantum dynamic runtime assertion. Stabilizer is an approach adopted for correcting quantum errors. The quantum state can remain unchanged after several Pauli operations. We call these Pauli operations a stabilizer. In this work, we propose to use the quantum stabilizers for dynamic runtime assertions, which requires less quantum gates and increases the detect accuracy on Noisy intermediate scale quantum(NISQ)."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sCbkO2oAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=sCbkO2oAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13257490800118963361&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Yushi Cao", "Yon Shin Teo", "Yan Zheng", "Yuxuan Toh", "Shang-Wei Lin"], "publication_date": "2022", "conference": "International Conference on Intelligent Software Methodologies, Tools, and Techniques (SOMET)", "pages": "286", "publisher": "IOS Press"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sCbkO2oAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=sCbkO2oAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C": {"external_link": null, "authors": ["Pao-Ann Hsiung", "Shang-Wei Lin"], "publication_date": "2012/10/19", "journal": "Handbook on Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing: Status and Perspective", "pages": "395", "publisher": "CRC Press"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sCbkO2oAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=sCbkO2oAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC": {"external_link": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tpnE4U1m4o8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA78&dq=info:R514qrtSUhoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Xjqyxp6W7Z&sig=dd3QlKYGgqMchppbgblcfoSp0oQ", "authors": ["Yu-Shin Lin", "Shang-Wei Lin", "Chao-Sheng Lin", "Chun-Hsien Lu", "Chia-Chiao Ho", "Yi-Luen Chang", "Bo-Hsuan Wang", "Pao-Ann Hsiung"], "publication_date": "2011", "journal": "Multicore Hardware-software Design and Verification Techniques", "pages": "78", "publisher": "Bentham Science Publishers", "description": "This chapter demonstrates how high-level code is automatically generated for multi-core processors.

After users specify embedded software requirements via SysML models along with parallel task, parallel data, and parallel dataflow specifications, the code generator automatically generates parallel code. Using the digital video recording (DVR) system as a case study, we show the correctness and advantages of the VMC code generator. The main inputs of VMC code generator include the block definition diagrams, state machine diagrams, and requirement diagrams of the system to be designed.

In this work, we reveal the internal architecture and design flow of a newly proposed framework called Verifiable Embedded Real-Time Application Framework (VERTAF), which integrates software component-based reuse, formal synthesis, and formal verification. Component reuse is based on a formal UML real-time embedded object model. Formal synthesis employs quasi-static and quasi-dynamic scheduling with multi-layer portable efficient code generation, which can output either RTOS-specific application code or automatically-generated real-time executive with application code. Formal verification integrates a model checker kernel from SGM, by adapting it for embedded software. Application examples developed using\u00a0\u2026"}}
