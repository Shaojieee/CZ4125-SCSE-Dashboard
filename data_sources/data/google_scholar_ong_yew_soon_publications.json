Today, there is a growing consensus among the computational intelligence communities that data volume presents an immediate challenge pertaining to the scalability issue. However, when addressing volume in Big Data analytics, researchers in the data analytics community have largely taken a one-sided study of volume, which is the \"Big Instance Size\" factor of the data. The flip side of volume which is the dimensionality factor of Big Data, on the other hand, has received much lesser attention. This article thus represents an attempt to fill in this gap and places special focus on this relatively under-explored topic of \"Big Dimensionality\", wherein the explosion of features (variables) brings about new challenges to computational intelligence.

We propose the approach of sequential learning of smart contract weaknesses using machine learning---long-short term memory (LSTM)---that allows us to be able to detect new attack trends relatively quickly, leading to safer smart contracts. Our experimental studies on 620,000 smart contracts prove that our model can easily scale to analyze a massive amount of contracts; that is, the LSTM maintains near constant analysis time as contracts increase in complexity.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-stream fully convolutional network, named MIML-FCN+, unified by a novel PI loss to solve the problem of MIML learning with privileged bags. Compared to the previous works on PI, the proposed MIML-FCN+ utilizes the readily available privileged bags, instead of hard-to-obtain privileged instances, making the system more general and practical in real world applications. As the proposed PI loss is convex and SGD-compatible and the framework itself is a fully convolutional network, MIML FCN+ can be easily integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning networks.

Extensive experiments on COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on several downstream tasks.

We theoretically analyze that there exists a gap between the volume rendering integral and point-based signed distance function (SDF) modeling. To bridge this gap, we directly locate the zero-level set of SDF networks and explicitly perform multi-view geometry optimization by leveraging the sparse geometry from structure from motion (SFM) and photometric consistency in multi-view stereo.

In this chapter we present a Single/Multi-objective Inverse Robust Evolutionary (SMIRE) optimization methodology. In contrast to conventional forward robust optimization, an inverse approach based on non-probabilistic methods is introduced to avoid making possible erroneous assumptions about the uncertainty when insufficient field data exists for accurately estimating its structure.

Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental results on ImageNet and several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches. Furthermore, we also comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of classical image restoration tasks for representation learning from a unified frequency perspective and reveal their intriguing relations with our MFM approach.

Considering the power of implicit parallelism, we are drawn to the idea that population-based search strategies provide an idyllic setting for leveraging the underlying synergies between objective function landscapes of seemingly distinct optimization tasks, particularly when they are solved together in a unified space with a single population of evolving individuals. Allowing the principles of evolution to autonomously exploit the available synergies can often lead to accelerated convergence for otherwise complex tasks. With the aim of providing deeper insight into the processes of evolutionary multitasking, we present in this paper a conceptualization of what, in our opinion, is one possible interpretation of the complementarity between optimization tasks.

However, in a practical scenario, it is quite natural that the data labels are available only after some temporal lag. This paper explores how a stream classifier model can be made adaptive to such label latency scenario. We propose SkipE-RNN, a self-evolutionary recurrent neural network with dynamically evolving skipped-recurrent-connection for the best utilization of previously observed label information while classifying the current data. When the data label is unavailable, SkipE-RNN uses an auto-learned mapping function to find the best match from the already known data labels and updates the network parameter accordingly. Later, upon availability of true data label, if the previously mapped label is found to be incorrect, SkipE-RNN employs a regularization technique along with the parameter updating process, so as to penalize the model. In addition, SkipE-RNN has inborn power of self-adjusting the network capacity by growing/pruning hidden nodes to cope with the evolving nature of data stream. Rigorous empirical evaluations using synthetic as well as real-world datasets reveal effectiveness of SkipE-RNN in both finitely delayed and infinitely delayed data label scenarios.", "total_citations": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:A8cqit5AE6sC": {"external_link": "https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2017-4434", "authors": ["Alan W Tan", "Ramon Sagarna", "Abhishek Gupta", "Rohitash Chandra", "Yew Soon Ong"], "publication_date": "2017", "book": "18th AIAA/ISSMO Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization Conference", "pages": "4434", "description": "The modern day aircraft plays a significant role in today\u2019s society.

To achieve this, we propose Jacobian frequency regularization for models' Jacobians to have a larger ratio of low-frequency components. Through experiments on four image datasets, we show that biasing classifiers towards low (high)-frequency components can bring performance gain against high (low)-frequency corruption and adversarial perturbation, albeit with a tradeoff in performance for low (high)-frequency corruption.

More importantly, the EP approach is inherently a parallel search algorithm, making it amenable to exploit the immense computational resources that a grid computing architecture can provide.
