Several techniques have been recently proposed for the recommendation service. However, no existing work has considered the temporal information for POI recommendations in LBSNs.

Inconsistencies and errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirty database D, one needs automated methods to make it consistent, ie, find a repair D that satisfies the constraints and \u201cminimally\u201d differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that the automatically-generated repair D is accurate, or makes sense, ie, D differs from the \u201ccorrect\u201d data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving both data consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data, which are able to capture inconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improve the consistency of the data, we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a repair D that satisfies a given set of CFDs, and the other for incrementally finding a repair in response to updates to a clean database. We show that both problems are intractable. Although our algorithms are necessarily heuristic, we experimentally verify that the methods are effective and efficient.

The key idea is to send the whole query to each site which partially evaluates, in parallel, the query and sends the results as compact boolean functions to a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has several advantages. First, each site is visited only once, even if several fragments of the tree are stored at that site. Second, no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed, nor is any structural information about the tree required, such as a dtd. Third, there is a satisfactory bound on the total computation performed on all sites and on the total network traffic.

All in all, our key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures fine-grained interactions between group members.

In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific fully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing foundation models still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing a FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodality nature of geospatial tasks.

This functionality enables a user to identify regions that share characteristics with a user-supplied region that the user is familiar with and likes. More specifically, we formalize and study a new problem called the attribute-aware similar region search (ASRS) problem. We first define so-called composite aggregators that are able to express aspects of interest in terms of the information associated with a user-supplied region. When applied to a region, an aggregator captures the region's relevant characteristics. Next, given a query region and a composite aggregator, we propose a novel algorithm called DS-Search to find the most similar region of the same size.

However, dimensionality reduction method sometimes results in unstable performance due to the suboptimal solution in original space. In this paper, we propose a dual random projection framework for similarity learning to recover the original optimal solution from subspace optimal solution. Previous dual random projection methods usually make strong assumptions about the data, which need to be low rank or have a large margin. Those assumptions limit dual random projection applications in similarity learning. Thus, we adopt a dual-sparse regularized random projection method that introduces a sparse regularizer into the reduced dual problem. As the original dual solution is a sparse one, applying a sparse regularizer in the reduced space relaxes the low-rank assumption.

Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such as SUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN. After that, a efficient data structure called QC-tree [11] is also proposed by the same authors. While the important incremental maintenance problem is tackled in the paper, aggregation was considered only in a limited sense; for example, aggregation with holistic aggregation function was not allowed. To update the value of holistic aggregation is very difficult since all history tuple values must be kept and the new aggregate value needs to be recomputed even after one tuple is inserted or deleted. Expensive space and time cost make it to be unrealistic to update a holistic aggregation. In this paper, we introduced two techniques called addset data structure and sliding window to deal with this problem.

BasicTS establishes a unified training pipeline and reasonable evaluation settings, enabling an unbiased evaluation of over 30 popular MTS forecasting models on more than 18 datasets. Furthermore, we highlight the heterogeneity among MTS datasets and classify them based on temporal and spatial characteristics.

This can be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of geospatial data, which encompasses different data types, including points, segments and regions, as well as multiple information modalities, such as a spatial position, visual characteristics and textual annotations. The proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information initiatives, and the ever-increasing availability of open geospatial data sources, like OpenStreetMap, which is freely accessible globally, unveil a promising opportunity to bridge this gap. In this paper, we present CityFM, a self-supervised framework to train a foundation model within a selected geographical area of interest, such as a city.

We analyse the entity representations generated using our foundation models from a qualitative perspective, and conduct quantitative experiments on road, building, and region-level downstream tasks.

To address this challenge, we propose a new model that integrates multiple Gaussian mixture models and a deep autoregressive model. On the one hand, Gaussian mixture models can fit the distribution of continuous attributes and reduce their domain sizes. On the other hand, deep autoregressive model can learn the joint data distribution with reduced domain attributes.

This is typically done by specifying some initial values of the constraints that are subsequently refined iteratively until satisfactory results are obtained. Most of existing schemes fail to exploit the frequent patterns from an early round of mining for subsequent iterations.In this chapter, a novel technique is proposed to solve this problem. Using the relaxation of frequency constraint (the decrease of minimum support) as an example, this chapter first proposes the concept of tree boundary to summarize and to reorganize the previous mining results. This chaper then shows that the additional frequent itemsets can be generated in the new mining process by extending only the itemsets on the tree boundary without re-generating the frequent itemsets produced in the previous mining."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WFFamJkAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=WFFamJkAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14196704741181366949&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Substructures from Hierarchical", "Semi-structured Data", "Gao Cong", "Lan Yi", "Bing Liu", "Ke Wang"], "publication_date": "2002", "journal": "Proceedings of the Second SIAM International Conference on Data Mining", "pages": "175", "publisher": "Soc for Industrial & Applied Math", "description": "Frequent substructure discovery from a collection of semi-structured objects can serve for storage, browsing, querying, indexing and classification of semi-structured documents. This paper examines the problem of discovering frequent substructures from a collection of hierarchical semi-structured objects of the same type. The use of wildcard is an important aspect of substructure discovery from semi-structured data due to the irregularity and lack of fixed structure of such data. This paper proposes a more general and powerful wildcard mechanism, which allows us to find more complex and interesting substructures than existing techniques. Furthermore, the complexity of structural information of semi-structured data and the usage of wildcard make the existing frequent set mining algorithms inapplicable for substructure discovery. In this work, we adopt a vertical format for the storage of semi-structured objects, and adapt a frequent set mining algorithm for our purpose. The application of our approach to real-life data shows that it is very effective."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WFFamJkAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=WFFamJkAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC": {"external_link": null, "authors": ["Gao CONG", "Minqiang LI", "Jisong KOU"], "publication_date": "1999", "journal": "SYSTEMS ENGINEERING-THEORY & PRACTICE", "volume": "9"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WFFamJkAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=WFFamJkAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC": {"external_link": "https://zhengwang125.github.io/paper/SIGMOD23_rlrtree.pdf", "authors": ["Tu Gu", "Kaiyu Feng", "Gao Cong", "Cheng Long", "Zheng Wang", "Sheng Wang"], "description": "Learned indices have been proposed to replace classic index structures like B-Tree with machine learning (ML) models. They require to replace both the indices and query processing algorithms currently deployed by the databases, and such a radical departure is likely to encounter challenges and obstacles. In contrast, we propose a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to build a better R-Tree without the need to change the structure or query processing algorithms of traditional R-Tree. Specifically, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building and updating an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic rules currently used by the R-Tree and its variants. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with up to more than 100 million spatial objects show that our RL based index outperforms the R-Tree and its variants in terms of query processing time."}}
