One challenge in ASR for speech-impaired individuals is the difficulty in obtaining a good speech database of impaired speakers for building an effective speech acoustic model. Because there are very few existing databases of impaired speech, which are also limited in size, the obvious solution to build a speech acoustic model of impaired speech is by employing adaptation techniques. However, issues that have not been addressed in existing studies in the area of adaptation for speech impairment are as follows: (1) identifying the most effective adaptation technique for impaired speech; and (2) the use of suitable source models to build an effective impaired-speech acoustic model. This research investigates the above-mentioned two issues on dysarthria, a type of speech impairment affecting millions of people.

In the nonlinear feature mapping approach, DNN is trained from parallel clean/distorted speech corpus to map reverberant and noisy speech coefficients (such as log magnitude spectrum) to the underlying clean speech coefficients. The constraint imposed by dynamic features (i.e., the time derivatives of the speech coefficients) are used to enhance the smoothness of predicted coefficient trajectories in two ways. One is to obtain the enhanced speech coefficients with a least square estimation from the coefficients and dynamic features predicted by DNN. The other is to incorporate the constraint of dynamic features directly into the DNN training process using a sequential cost function. In the linear feature adaptation approach, a sparse linear transform, called cross transform, is used to transform multiple frames of speech coefficients to a new feature space. The transform is estimated to maximize the likelihood of the transformed coefficients given a model of clean speech coefficients. Unlike the DNN approach, no parallel corpus is used and no assumption on distortion types is made. The two approaches are evaluated on the REVERB Challenge 2014 tasks.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust SCM estimation method, called weighted SCM (WSCM). In the WSCM estimation, each time-frequency (TF) bin of the input signal is weighted by a TF mask which is 0 for non-speech TF bins and 1 for speech TF bins in ideal case. In practice, the TF mask takes values between 0 and 1 that are predicted by a long short term memory (LSTM) network trained from a large amount of simulated noisy and reverberant data. The use of mask weights significantly reduces the contribution of low SNR TF bins to the SCM estimation, hence improves the robustness of MUSIC.

Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that, latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness, the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be completely eliminated. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named Wav2code to implement a generalized SE without distortions for noise-robust ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the original clean representations, in order to store them in codebook as prior.

However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience performance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a well-trained acoustic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain, eg, background noise. Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on their linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually inferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory system. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source benchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error correction, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for true transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the traditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one candidate hypothesis as the output transcription. The proposed benchmark contains a novel dataset,\u201cHyPoradise\u201d(HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs of N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent speech domains. Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction techniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled hypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER) reduction.

In this paper, we propose a noise-aware speech enhancement (NASE) approach that extracts noise-specific information to guide the reverse process in diffusion model. Specifically, we design a noise classification (NC) model to produce acoustic embedding as a noise conditioner for guiding the reverse denoising process.

Experimental results show that the proposed approach sig-nificantly improves the performance of overlapped multi-talker speaker verification and achieves 64.4% relative EER reduction over the zero-effort baseline."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=FJodrCcAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=FJodrCcAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17735019075507814432&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Min Zhang", "Engsiong Chng", "Haizhou Li"], "journal": "Proc. International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing", "pages": "283-286", "description": "In this paper, we propose a novel semi-class-based n-gram language modeling. The proposed modeling estimates the n-gram probability from the observed frequencies of word-class n-tuples, constituted by the (n-1) classes of preceding (n-1) words of the utterance and the current word itself. Three kinds of language modeling, word-based, class-based and semi-class-based n-gram modeling are implemented to build bi-gram and tri-gram models for a vocabulary of 50k words over a corpus of over 200 millions Chinese words. The parameter numbers and LM perplexities among the three models have been studied and compared. Our experiments show that our proposal of using the semi-class language modeling is a good tradeoff between the number of parameters and LM perplexity."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=FJodrCcAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=FJodrCcAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9747031/", "authors": ["Haizhou Li", "Sadaoki Furui", "Tsuhan Chen", "Woon-Seng Gan", "Kai Kuang Ma", "Lei Wang", "Yan Wu", "Minghui Dong", "Fa-Long Luo", "Jay Kuo", "Helen Meng", "HKSAR CUHK", "China Douglas O\u2019Shaughnessy", "Jonathon Chambers", "UK Uleicester", "Zhenggou Li", "Pina Marzilano", "Mauro Barni", "Saeid Sanei", "UK NottinghamTU", "Tanja Schultz", "Kenan Emir Ak", "Rongshan Yu", "Eng Siong Chng", "Andy Khong", "Wee Peng Tay", "Nancy Chen", "Tomi Kinnunen", "Zhizheng Wu", "Lei Xie"], "description": "Provides a listing of current committee members and society officers."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=FJodrCcAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=FJodrCcAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C": {"external_link": "https://blog.csdn.net/yj13811596648/article/details/104288216", "authors": ["Wei Rao", "Chenglin Xu", "Eng Siong Chng", "Haizhou Li"], "description": "The performance of speaker verification degrades significantly when the test speech is corrupted by interference from non-target speakers.
