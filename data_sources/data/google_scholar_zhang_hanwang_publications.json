Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose collocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see the relation\" person on bike\", it is natural to replace\" on\" with\" ride\" and infer\" person riding bike on a road\" even the\" road\" is not evident. Therefore, exploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional encoder-decoder models less likely to overfit to the dataset bias and focus on reasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph---a directed graph (G) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and relationship nodes---to represent the complex structural layout of both image (I) and sentence (S). In the textual domain, we use SGAE to learn a dictionary (D) that helps to reconstruct sentences in the S-> G-> D-> S pipeline, where D encodes the desired language prior; in the vision-language domain, we use the shared D to guide the encoder-decoder in the I-> G-> D-> S pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph representation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across domains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark, eg, our SGAE-based single-model achieves a new state-of-the-art 127.8 CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive 125.5 CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble models.

To reduce the language biases, several recent works introduce an auxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of targeted VQA model, and achieve dominating performance on VQA-CP. However, since the complexity of design, current methods are unable to equip the ensemble-based models with two indispensable characteristics of an ideal VQA model: 1) visual-explainable: the model should rely on the right visual regions when making decisions. 2) question-sensitive: the model should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in question. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) training scheme. The CSS generates numerous counterfactual training samples by masking critical objects in images or words in questions, and assigning different ground-truth answers. After training with the complementary samples (ie, the original and generated samples), the VQA models are forced to focus on all critical objects and words, which significantly improves both visual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities. In return, the performance of these models is further boosted. Extensive ablations have shown the effectiveness of CSS.

Existing methods usually utilize pre-defined pruning criteria, such as Lp-norm, to prune unimportant filters. There are two major limitations to these methods. First, existing methods fail to consider the variety of filter distribution across layers. To extract features of the coarse level to the fine level, the filters of different layers have various distributions. Therefore, it is not suitable to utilize the same pruning criteria to different functional layers. Second, prevailing layer-by-layer pruning methods process each layer independently and sequentially, failing to consider that all the layers in the network collaboratively make the final prediction. In this paper, we propose Learning Filter Pruning Criteria (LFPC) to solve the above problems. Specifically, we develop a differentiable pruning criteria sampler. This sampler is learnable and optimized by the validation loss of the pruned network obtained from the sampled criteria. In this way, we could adaptively select the appropriate pruning criteria for different functional layers. Besides, when evaluating the sampled criteria, LFPC comprehensively consider the contribution of all the layers at the same time.

In particular, we develop a novel modular network called Neural Module Tree network (NMTree) that regularizes the visual grounding along the dependency parsing tree of the sentence, where each node is a neural module that calculates visual attention according to its linguistic feature, and the grounding score is accumulated in a bottom-up direction where as needed. NMTree disentangles the visual grounding from the composite reasoning, allowing the former to only focus on primitive and easy-to-generalize patterns. To reduce the impact of parsing errors, we train the modules and their assembly end-to-end by using the Gumbel-Softmax approximation and its straight-through gradient estimator, accounting for the discrete nature of module assembly.

Due to the exponential complexity involved in modeling the context associated with multiple image regions, existing work oversimplifies this task to pairwise region modeling by multiple instance learning. In this paper, we propose a variational Bayesian method, called Variational Context, to solve the problem of complex context modeling in referring expression grounding.

If\" yes\", the sample is from a certain class, and\" no\" otherwise. Through extensive experiments on ZSL and OSR, we demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates the seen/unseen imbalance and hence significantly improves the overall performance. Note that this framework is orthogonal to existing methods, thus, it can serve as a new baseline to evaluate how ZSL/OSR models generalize.

However, the grounding accuracy of existing captioners is far from satisfactory. To improve the grounding accuracy while retaining the captioning quality, it is expensive to collect the word-region alignment as strong supervision. To this end, we propose a Part-of-Speech (POS) enhanced image-text matching model (SCAN): POS-SCAN, as the effective knowledge distillation for more grounded image captioning. The benefits are two-fold: 1) given a sentence and an image, POS-SCAN can ground the objects more accurately than SCAN; 2) POS-SCAN serves as a word-region alignment regularization for the captioner's visual attention module.

As a result, given a class, its hot CAM pixels may wrongly invade the area belonging to other classes, or the non-hot ones may be actually a part of the class. To this end, we introduce an embarrassingly simple yet surprisingly effective method: Reactivating the converged CAM with BCE by using softmax cross-entropy loss (SCE), dubbed ReCAM.

Once converged, we extract ReCAM in the same way as in CAM. Thanks to the contrastive nature of SCE, the pixel response is disentangled into different classes and hence less mask ambiguity is expected.

However, the large number of feature dimensions, e.g., usually larger than 10^7, results in expensive storage and computational cost.

In this paper, we develop a generic feature-based recommendation model, called Discrete Factorization Machine (DFM), for fast and accurate recommendation. DFM binarizes the real-valued model parameters (e.g., float32) of every feature embedding into binary codes (e.g., boolean), and thus supports efficient storage and fast user-item score computation. To avoid the severe quantization loss of the binarization, we propose a convergent updating rule that resolves the challenging discrete optimization of DFM. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we show that 1) DFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art binarized recommendation models, and 2) DFM shows very competitive performance compared to its real-valued version (FM), demonstrating the minimized quantization loss.

Existing two-stage solutions mostly focus on the grounding step, which aims to align the expressions with the proposals. In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an obvious mismatch between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they generate proposals solely based on the detection confidence (ie, expression-agnostic), hoping that the proposals contain all right instances in the expression (ie, expression-aware). Due to this mismatch, current two-stage methods suffer from a severe performance drop between detected and ground-truth proposals. To this end, we propose Ref-NMS, which is the first method to yield expression-aware proposals at the first stage. Ref-NMS regards all nouns in the expression as critical objects, and introduces a lightweight module to predict a score for aligning each box with a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS operation to filter out the boxes irrelevant to the expression, increasing the recall of critical objects, resulting in a significantly improved grounding performance. Since Ref-NMS is agnostic to the grounding step, it can be easily integrated into any state-of-the-art two-stage method.

We use a causal view---transportability theory---to identify that such loss is in fact a confounding effect, which can only be removed by causal intervention. However, the theoretical solution provided by transportability is far from practical for UDA, because it requires the stratification and representation of the unobserved confounder that is the cause of the domain gap.

To achieve CounterAL, we design a new acquisition strategy that selects the informative factual-counterfactual pairs for annotation; and a new training strategy that pushes the model update to focus on the discrepancy between factual and counterfactual samples.

To mitigate this, we propose a Fast Diffusion Model (FDM) which improves the diffusion process of DMs from a stochastic optimization perspective to speed up both training and sampling. Specifically, we first find that the diffusion process of DMs accords with the stochastic optimization process of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a stochastic time-variant problem. Note that momentum SGD uses both the current gradient and an extra momentum, achieving more stable and faster convergence. We are inspired to introduce momentum into the diffusion process to accelerate both training and sampling. However, this comes with the challenge of deriving the noise perturbation kernel from the momentum-based diffusion process. To this end, we frame the momentum-based process as a Damped Oscillation system whose critically damped state -- the kernel solution -- avoids oscillation and thus has a faster convergence speed of the diffusion process. Empirical results show that our FDM can be applied to several popular DM frameworks, e.g. VP, VE, and EDM, and reduces their training cost by about 50% with comparable image synthesis performance on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and AFHQv2 datasets.

While existing state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation, they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g., action occurrence disorders, crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics modeling, one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work, we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs, for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition, we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module, which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement, (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations, and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) via in-context learning, Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding. Finally, the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features, integrated into the backbone T2V DM for video generating.

This allows VLMs to generalize better to nuanced and unseen multimodal compositions. However, modeling equivariance is challenging as the ground truth of semantic change is difficult to collect.

In sharp contrast to traditional Relevance Feedback (RF), we propose a novel paradigm for fast video browsing dubbed Mental Visual Indexing (MVI). At each interactive round, the user only needs to select one of the displayed shots that is most visually similar to her mental target and then the user's choice will further tailor the search to the target. The search model update given a user feedback only requires vector inner products, which makes MVI highly responsive. MVI is underpinned by a sequence model in terms of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is trained by automatically generated shot sequences from a rigorous Bayesian framework, which simulates user feedback process.

These video-language models are proficient at representing short-term actions, basic objects, and their combinations, but they are still far from understanding long-term procedures. In addition, the predetermined procedure category faces the problem of combination disaster and is inherently inapt to unseen procedures.

Different from the image case where an object covers some spatial patches, an object in a video usually appears as an object trajectory, i.e., it spans over a few spatial but longer temporal patches and thus contains abundant spatiotemporal contexts. However, modern VDL-BERTs neglect this trajectory characteristic that they usually follow IL-BERTs to deploy the patch-to-word (P2W) attention while such attention may over-exploit trivial spatial contexts and neglect significant temporal contexts. To amend this, we propose a novel TW-BERT to learn Trajectory-Word alignment for solving video-language tasks. Such alignment is learned by a newly designed trajectory-to-word (T2W) attention. Besides T2W attention, we also follow previous VDL-BERTs to set a word-to-patch (W2P) attention in the cross-modal encoder. Since T2W and W2P attentions have diverse structures, our cross-modal encoder is asymmetric. To further help this asymmetric cross-modal encoder build robust vision-language associations, we propose a fine-grained ``align-before-fuse'' strategy to pull close the embedding spaces calculated by the video and text encoders. By the proposed strategy and T2W attention, our TW-BERT achieves SOTA performances on text-to-video retrieval tasks, and comparable performances on video question answering tasks with some VDL-BERTs trained on much more data.

We use this name since each layer of ACF can adaptively cluster input elements to carry self-attention (Self-ATT) for learning local context. Compared with other global-local Transformers which carry Self-ATT in fixed-size windows, ACF can capture varying graininess, \\eg, an object may cover different numbers of grids or a phrase may contain diverse numbers of words. To build ACF, we insert a probabilistic matrix C into the Self-ATT layer. For an input sequence {{s}_1,...,{s}_N , C_{i,j} softly determines whether the sub-sequence {s_i,...,s_j} should be clustered for carrying Self-ATT. For implementation, {C}_{i,j} is calculated from the contexts of {{s}_i,...,{s}_j}, thus ACF can exploit the input itself to decide which local contexts should be learned. By using ACF to build the vision encoder and language decoder, the captioning model can automatically discover the hidden structures in both vision and language, which encourages the model to learn a unified structural space for transferring more structural commonalities. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACF that we achieve CIDEr of 137.8, which outperforms most SOTA captioning models and achieve comparable scores compared with some BERT-based models.

Specifically, we propose RandBox, a Fast R-CNN based architecture trained on random proposals at each training iteration, surpassing existing Faster R-CNN and Transformer based OWOD. Its effectiveness stems from the following two benefits introduced by randomness. First, as the randomization is independent of the distribution of the limited known objects, the random proposals become the instrumental variable that prevents the training from being confounded by the known objects. Second, the unbiased training encourages more proposal explorations by using our proposed matching score that does not penalize the random proposals whose prediction scores do not match the known objects.
