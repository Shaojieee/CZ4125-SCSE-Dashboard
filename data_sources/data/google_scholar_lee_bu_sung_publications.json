Users are using Twitter to report real-life events. This paper focuses on detecting those events by analyzing the text stream in Twitter. Although event detection has long been a research topic, the characteristics of Twitter make it a non-trivial task. Tweets reporting such events are usually overwhelmed by high flood of meaningless \u201cbabbles\u201d. Moreover, event detection algorithm needs to be scalable given the sheer amount of tweets. This paper attempts to tackle these challenges with EDCoW (Event Detection with Clustering of Wavelet-based Signals). EDCoW builds signals for individual words by applying wavelet analysis on the frequencybased raw signals of the words. It then filters away the trivial words by looking at their corresponding signal autocorrelations. The remaining words are then clustered to form events with a modularity-based graph partitioning technique. Experimental results show promising result of EDCoW.", "total_citations": {"2011": 4, "2012": 50, "2013": 88, "2014": 93, "2015": 121, "2016": 150, "2017": 130, "2018": 126, "2019": 86, "2020": 82, "2021": 50, "2022": 54, "2023": 18}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5710870/", "authors": ["Sivadon Chaisiri", "Bu-Sung Lee", "Dusit Niyato"], "publication_date": "2011/2/10", "journal": "IEEE transactions on services Computing", "volume": "5", "issue": "2", "pages": "164-177", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "In cloud computing, cloud providers can offer cloud consumers two provisioning plans for computing resources, namely reservation and on-demand plans.

With the reservation plan, the consumer can reduce the total resource provisioning cost. However, the best advance reservation of resources is difficult to be achieved due to uncertainty of consumer's future demand and providers' resource prices. To address this problem, an optimal cloud resource provisioning (OCRP) algorithm is proposed by formulating a stochastic programming model.

However, the slot-based MapReduce system (e.g., Hadoop MRv1) can suffer from poor performance due to its unoptimized resource allocation. To address it, this paper identifies and optimizes the resource allocation from three key aspects. First, due to the pre-configuration of distinct map slots and reduce slots which are not fungible, slots can be severely under-utilized.

In addition, the relationship between the smoothness of body joints and that of the clubhead was evaluated to provide further insight into the mechanism of smooth golf swing. Two subject groups (skilled and unskilled) participated in the experiment. The skilled group comprised 20 male professional golfers registered with the Korea Professional Golf Association, and the unskilled group comprised 19 amateur golfers who enjoy golf as a hobby. Six infrared cameras (VICON460 system) were used to record the 3D trajectories of markers attached to the clubhead and body segments, and the resulting data was evaluated with kinematic analysis. A physical quantity called jerk was calculated to investigate differences in smoothness during downswing between the two study groups. The hypothesis that skilled golfers swing a driver with a smoother motion than do unskilled golfers was supported. The normalized jerk of the clubhead of skilled golfers was lower than that of unskilled golfers in the anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, and proximal/distal directions.

First, LTRF incentivizes clients to share resources via group-buying by ensuring that no client is better off in a computing system that she buys and uses individually. Second, LTRF incentivizes clients to submit non-trivial workloads and be willing to yield unneeded resources to others.

Recent evidence has shown that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), mediators of posttranscriptional gene knockdown, can act as effective antiviral agents. Thus, the authors attempted to develop a novel siRNA-based anti-AHC agent effective against both EV70 and CVA24.Methods.: Concurrent screening of the entire viral genome sequences of EV70 and CVA24 using the CAPSID program identified five different siRNA candidates complementary to genome regions of both viruses. The antiviral potentials of these siRNAs were assessed by treating MRC5 and primary human conjunctival cells with the siRNAs and following this with viral challenge.Results.: Among the five siRNAs, AHCe-3D-3 siRNA showed excellent cytoprotective effects and dramatic decreases in virus replication and virus protein synthesis. This siRNA, targeting the virus polymerase 3D gene, also induced similar antiviral effects in primary human conjunctival cells.Conclusions.: These findings strongly suggest that the AHCe-3D-3 siRNA, homologous to two different AHC-associated enteroviruses, can provide equivalent antiviral activities against both AHC-causing enteroviruses.

The product is used in xenobiotic glucuronidation in hepatocytes and in the production of proteoglycans that are involved in promoting normal cellular growth and migration. Overproduction of proteoglycans has been implicated in the progression of certain epithelial cancers, while inhibition of UGDH diminished tumor angiogenesis in vivo. A better understanding of the conformational changes occurring during the UGDH reaction cycle will pave the way for inhibitor design and potential cancer therapeutics. Methodology Previously, the substrate-bound of UGDH was determined to be a symmetrical hexamer and this regular symmetry is disrupted on binding the inhibitor, UDP-\u03b1-D-xylose. Here, we have solved an alternate crystal structure of human UGDH (hUGDH) in complex with UDP-glucose at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. Surprisingly, the quaternary structure of this substrate-bound protein complex consists of the open homohexamer that was previously observed for inhibitor-bound hUGDH, indicating that this conformation is relevant for deciphering elements of the normal reaction cycle. Conclusion In all subunits of the present open structure, Thr131 has translocated into the active site occupying the volume vacated by the absent active water and partially disordered NAD+ molecule. This conformation suggests a mechanism by which the enzyme may exchange NADH for NAD+ and repolarize the catalytic water bound to Asp280 while protecting the reaction\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5558183/", "authors": ["Yang Xia", "Bu Sung Lee", "Chai Kiat Yeo", "Vincent Lim Sok Seng"], "publication_date": "2010/7/18", "conference": "2010 Second International Conference on Advances in Future Internet", "pages": "108-112", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "With the fast growth of Internet, IPv4 address exhaustion is an imminent problem.

Methods: We investigated the motor performance of 9 dyskinetic and 10 non-dyskinetic PD subjects on and off l-DOPA, and of 10 age-matched control subjects, during a large-amplitude, overlearned, visually guided tracking task. Ambiguous visual feedback was introduced by adding \u201cjitter\u201d to a moving target that followed a Lissajous pattern. Root mean square (RMS) tracking error was calculated, and ANOVA, robust multivariate linear regression, and linear dynamical system analyses were used to determine the contribution of speed and ambiguity to tracking performance. Results: Increasing target ambiguity and speed contributed significantly more to the RMS error of dyskinetic subjects off medication. l-DOPA improved the RMS tracking performance of both PD groups. At higher speeds, controls and PDs without dyskinesia were able to effectively de-weight ambiguous visual information.

Caring for elders, especially those diagnosed with dementia, can be challenging. People living with dementia (PWD) require extra care and attention from the caregivers due to the associated behaviours that come with dementia. Wandering is a frequent behaviour exhibited by PWD, which can bring about negative outcomes on the PWD as well as increasing the stress of the caregivers. Though many technological solutions exist, they are not widely deployed. This paper introduces a technological framework, bridging the localisation technologies to the needs of elders and caregivers. The aim is to minimise or eliminate the negative outcomes of dementia wandering and to reduce the burden and stress on the caregivers, thus improving overall well-being. In this paper, we study the application, SingTRACeX, features by considering user needs from the field study with 2 focus group discussions (FGD), comprising of 14 professional caregivers and coordinators. The proposed system features Real-time Location Tracking and Indoor Localisation.

Under such circumstances, MFCC, which requires audio processing, cannot be directly obtained from nor maximize the features of sound spectrum data stored in the application. As sound spectrum does not undergo further feature transformation, it retains audio features from the audio file and should therefore be classifiable when passed into a trained sound spectrum model.

The framework allows for the estimation of the aggregate V2G energy supply and demand at fine-grained spatial and temporal scales under a given electric vehicle usage scenario.

There is a trend of deploying a large number of commodity layer-2 Ethernet switches in Data Centers. However, the existing Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) used in the traditional Ethernet networks becomes inefficient for Data Centers as it underutilizes the resources due to the lack of multipath capability leading to poor bandwidth utilization. In this paper we develop a layer-2 load balancing framework with a multi-path forwarding mechanism which balances the load across the network, thereby reducing the occurrence of congestion that leads to efficient utilization of the bi-section bandwidth in Data Centers. The proposed framework has several important features: 1) It provides adaptive multi path forwarding compatibility in layer-2 Ethernet switched networks to efficiently spread the load in adaption to changing load conditions. 2) It improves the bi-section bandwidth utilization in Data Center networks. 3) It is capable of achieving load balancing at the layer-2 level and 4) It ensures effective traffic redistribution upon link failures.

An optimal strategy for NZBC coding is then derived and experimental results are given for a comparison of the new scheme with uniform bit allocation.Introduction: The FGS video coding technique [1] has been proposed as a new flexible and simple framework for scalable coding, whose major difference from conventional SNR scalability is the adoption of BP coding for discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients instead of the conventional quantization of DCT coefficients. When we deliver the FGS-coded bitstreams through a bandwidth-constrained environment, there is a need to regulate the bitstream and accordingly perform an efficient bit allocation. Recent methods [2, 3] on bit allocation for FGS coding either employ the classical RD model used in general transform coders to express the coding behaviors of FGS layer approximately, or extract the RD relationship from experimental video data; but do not give an analytic RD model that combines the characteristics of FGS coding. In this letter, we will propose a new bit allocation scheme for FGS coding after analyzing the relationship of RD behaviors with respect to NZBC. We observe that there is a linear relationship between the output rate and the percentage of encoded NZBC in each BP, and the distortion (D) is directly determined by the coded NZBC.

However, the benefits of these novel carnivorous traits are rarely tested. Here, we used field observations and lab experiments to test the prey capture function of the marginal spikes on snap traps of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). Our field and laboratory results suggested surprisingly inefficient capture success: fewer than 1 in 4 prey encounters led to prey capture. Removing the marginal spikes decreased the rate of prey capture success for moderate-sized cricket prey by 90%, but this effect disappeared for larger prey. The nonlinear benefit of spikes suggests that they provide a better cage for capturing more abundant insects of moderate and small sizes, but may also provide a foothold for rare large prey to escape. Our observations support Darwin\u2019s hypothesis that the marginal spikes form a \u2018horrid prison\u2019 that increases prey capture success for moderate-sized prey, but the decreasing benefit for larger prey is unexpected and previously undocumented. Thus, we find surprising complexity in the adaptive landscape for one of the most wonderful evolutionary innovations among all plants.

Especially in the marine engineering, resonance from exciting force of an engine and propeller causes fatigue damages of tanks. Vibration characteristics of these tanks in contact with fluid are significantly affected by added mass of fluid. Therefore, it is very important to estimate the added mass effect to predict vibration of the tank structures.

The main reason for the lack of bandwidth is channel interference, which is caused by contention for the shared channel between wireless nodes. The natural approach to overcome this problem is exploiting the availability of multiple channels multiple interfaces (MCMI) networks. However, it is costly and may not be practical to dedicate one interface per channel for every node. Thus in this paper, we study the MCMI network, where the number of interfaces that every node has is less than the number of available channels. Simple and distributed channel scheduling algorithms for communication in multiple channels multiple interfaces networks are discussed.

To reduce the communication overhead and thus the completion time of a parallel application, this paper introduces and analyzes an efficient Key Message (KM) approach to supporting parallel computing in cluster environments. The approach includes the application model and communication model. The application model adopts a DAG (directed acyclic graph) task graph to abstract a parallel application.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of PGMCC (Rizzo, 2000) in wireless access networks, and propose an enhanced multicast congestion control scheme, called PGMCC+, which achieves significant performance improvement over PGMCC over loss-prone wireless access links. The key idea of PGMCC+ is to discriminate random loss from congestion loss according to the measured network congestion level, and take different actions accordingly. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that PGMCC+ achieves significant throughput improvement up to 40% over PGMCC in wireless access links with typical random loss rate 1%.

A functional broker is deployed to facilitate remote resource access within the community grid. A major issue is the problem of correlations in job arrivals caused by seasonal usage and/or coincident resource usage demand patterns where high levels of burstiness in job arrivals can cause the job queue of the broker to grow to an extent such that its performance becomes severely impaired. Since job arrivals cannot be controlled, management strategies must be employed to admit jobs to sustain the resource allocation performance of the broker.

To achieve low delay, these traffic need to request for higher reservation rate on the scheduler rather than their long-term rate. We introduced dual-rate quantum-controlled scheduling (DQS). Instead of overprovisioning of bandwidth, DQS allows real-time flows with controlled traffic bursts to borrow bandwidth from non-real-time flows to achieve low packet delay with bandwidth reserved at their long-term rate. It uses two quantum controller for each real-time queue and a quantum controller for each non-real-time queue to control the amount of service between queues, thus protecting queues from any misbehaving queue and allowing implicit bandwidth borrowing for real-time queues.

To be specific, we first find the approximate linear relationship between the bit rate of the FGS-layer and the percentage of nonzero binary-scaled coefficients (NZBC) in each BF; second, with mathematical justification, we derive an optimal strategy by analyzing the overall distortion with respect to NZBC. Finally, we perform our optimum bit allocation (OBA) on a FGS coder. Experimental results prove that our scheme can achieve smooth video quality with a higher average PSNR gain compared with uniform bit allocation (UBA).

Butl. is a serious disease in all major cocoa growing countries. Application of copper fungicides using conventional methods often gives unsatisfactory control because of wet weather conditions and heavy infection. We evaluated the efficacy of phosphorous acid (PA) against the pathogen in the laboratory, and against the disease in the field using trunk injection technique. In vitro studies indicated PA at low concentrations significantly inhibited mycelial growth; the ED50 value was estimated at 12.4 ug/ml. Lesion size and degree of sporangial production on inoculated pods collected from trees injected with PA were significantly reduced compared to those from untreated trees. The inhibitory effect was evident one week after treatment and persisted for at least eight weeks. Field evaluation of PA was initiated in Jerangau, an area with high black pod incidence and heavy rainfall. Two, four and eight gm of PA per tree were injected through the main trunk using a plunger-type trunk injector (COLT 75, TIS Enterprise, PA, USA).

The incorporation of siRNAs dramatically decreased cell death in permissive HeLa cells in parallel with a reduction in viral replication. Three of four siRNAs had potent anti-CVB3 activity. The present study thus demonstrates that the antiviral effect is due to the downregulation of viral replication. In addition, an effective CVB3-specific siRNA had similar antiviral effects in other related enteroviruses possessing sequence homology in the targeted region. Because the CVB3-specific siRNA is effective against other enteroviruses, siRNAs have potential for a universal antienterovirus strategy.Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a major causative agent of many human diseases, such as meningioencephalitis and myocarditis (16\u201318, 20, 21). CVB3 is a member of the Picornaviridae family and consists of a positive single-stranded RNA genome coated with capsid proteins, including VP1-4 (Fig. 1A)(23). Previous studies by our group and others have implied that CVB3 infection causes productive virus replication, which results in cell death in both permissive and target cells (1, 2, 9), a process closely associated with CVB3-related human illness (6, 27, 28). Thus, directly blocking viral replication may be an effective strategy for treating the clinical symptoms of CVB3 infection."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:43B52WW2E64C": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8319157/", "authors": ["Shao Loong Lim", "Seanglidet Yean", "Bu Sung Lee", "Chai Kiat Yeo", "Amy Cheng", "Vaishnavi Raghavaraju"], "description": "System primitives allow for formalisms, reasoning, simulations, and reliability and security risk trade-offs to be formulated and argued.

A user\u2019s demand is often changing over time, indicating that it is difficult to keep the high resource utilization all the time for cost efficiency. Resource sharing is a classical and effective approach for high resource utilization. In view of the heterogeneous resource demands of users\u2019 workloads, multi-resource allocation fairness is a must for resource sharing in such pay-as-you-use computing systems. However, we find that, existing multi-resource fair policies such as Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), implemented in currently popular resource management systems such as Apache YARN [4] and Mesos [23], are not suitable for the pay-as-you-use computing systems. We show that this is because of their memoryless characteristic that can cause the following problems in the pay-as-you-use computing systems: 1). users can get resource benefits by cheating; 2). users might not be able to get the total amount of resources that they are entitled to in terms of their resource contributions. In this paper, we propose a new policy called H-MRF, which generalizes DRF and Asset Fairness with the long-term notion. We show that it can address these problems and is suitable for pay-as-you-use computing systems. We have implemented it into YARN by developing a prototype called MRYARN. Finally, we evaluate H-MRF using both testbed and simulated experiments. The experimental results show that there are about 1.1 \u201e1.5 sharing benefit degrees and 1.2 \u02c6 \u201e1.8 \u02c6 performance improvement for users with H-MRF, better than existing fair schedulers."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC": {"external_link": "http://varman.rice.edu/files/2014/07/pdcn97-sfwq4h.pdf", "authors": ["KK Leez", "M Kallahallay", "BS Leez", "PJ Varmany"], "description": "We present a simulation study of several prefetching policies to improve the IO performance of external merging using parallel I O.

YARN is a de facto resource management platform that enables these frameworks running together in a shared system. However, we observe that, in cloud computing environment, the fair resource allocation policy implemented in YARN is not suitable because of its memoryless resource allocation fashion leading to violations of a number of good properties in shared computing systems. This paper attempts to address these problems for YARN. Both singlelevel and hierarchical resource allocations are considered. For single-level resource allocation, we propose a novel fair resource allocation mechanism called Long-Term Resource Fairness (LTRF) for such computing. For hierarchical resource allocation, we propose Hierarchical Long-Term Resource Fairness (H-LTRF) by extending LTRF. We show that both LTRF and H-LTRF can address these fairness problems of current resource allocation policy and are thus suitable for cloud computing.

However, the slot-based MapReduce system (eg, Hadoop MRv1) can suffer from poor performance due to its unoptimized resource allocation. To address it, this paper identifies and optimizes the resource allocation from three key aspects. First, due to the pre-configuration of distinct map slots and reduce slots which are not fungible, slots can be severely under-utilized. Because map slots might be fully utilized while reduce slots are empty, and vice-versa. We proposes an alternative technique called Dynamic Hadoop Slot Allocation by keeping the slot-based model. It relaxes the slot allocation constraint to allow slots to be reallocated to either map or reduce tasks depending on their needs. Second, the speculative execution can tackle the straggler problem, which has shown to improve the performance for a single job but at the expense of the cluster efficiency. In view of this, we propose Speculative Execution Performance Balancing to balance the performance tradeoff between a single job and a batch of jobs. Third, delay scheduling has shown to improve the data locality but at the cost of fairness. Alternatively, we propose a technique called Slot PreScheduling that can improve the data locality but with no impact on fairness. Finally, by combining these techniques together, we form a step-by-step slot allocation system called DynamicMR that can improve the performance of MapReduce workloads substantially. The experimental results show that our DynamicMR can improve the performance of Hadoop MRv1 significantly while maintaining the\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC": {"external_link": "https://www.academia.edu/download/47912197/virtual_media.pdf", "authors": ["CK Yeo", "BS Lee", "V Anand", "Pathik Gupta", "Arun Puri", "Amol Dhabolkar"], "description": "This paper focuses on the design and development of a framework that provides a one-stop location to cater to media and entertainment needs of users over the internet.

Nevertheless, its performance is limited due to the burgeoning volume of scientific data, and parallelism is necessary and crucial to keep the computation time at acceptable levels. The intrinsically strong data dependency of dynamic programming makes it difficult and error-prone for the programmer to write a correct and efficient parallel program. Therefore this paper builds a runtime system named EasyPDP aiming at parallelizing dynamic programming algorithms on multi-core and multi-processor platforms. Under the concept of software reusability and complexity reduction of parallel programming, a DAG Data Driven Model is proposed, which supports those applications with a strong data interdependence relationship. Based on the model, EasyPDP runtime system is designed and implemented. It automatically handles thread creation, dynamic data task allocation and scheduling, data partitioning, and fault tolerance. Five frequently used DAG patterns from biological dynamic programming algorithms have been put into the DAG pattern library of EasyPDP, so that the programmer can choose to use any of them according to his/her specific application. Besides, an ideal computing distribution model is proposed to discuss the optimal values for the performance tuning arguments of EasyPDP. We evaluate the performance potential and fault tolerance feature of EasyPDP in multi-core system. We also compare EasyPDP with other methods such as Block-Cycle Wavefront (BCW).

One of the problem with causal order delivery algorithms is the need to attach the dependency information with each message to ensure the causal ordering of delivery. This introduces a large amount of overhead and limits the scalability of the algorithm. To reduce the amount of dependency information, an algorithm was proposed by Prakash to attach only direct dependency information to the messages. The algorithm is optimal in broadcast environment. However, in multicast environment, it fails to eliminate indirect dependencies in some cases. In this paper, an improved causal order delivery algorithm that eliminates indirect dependencies in broadcast as well as multicast environment is proposed. The new algorithm is analyzed against Prakash's algorithm in terms of optimality on eliminating indirect dependencies.

Ad Hoc Qs is a MAC independent IEEE 802.11-based traffic differentiation algorithm in Ad Hoc WLANs. Ad Hoc Qs uses Host Qs which is another Mac independent traffic differentiation algorithm. Host Qs is able to provide service differentiation for different three types in a single station. However it\u2019s not able to support service differentiation across the wireless media. Ad Hoc Qs provides service differentiation in wireless media. It is sensitive to the number of active stations and type of service that each station requests. We propose an analytical model for Ad Hoc Qs. Using this model we can adaptively choose the proper slot size according to the number of active stations and priority of traffic they send in order to get desired service differentiation across wireless LAN.

Many parallel programming languages and related parallel programming modes are becoming widely accepted. However, the execution of parallel applications on distributed systems has been hampered by the high communication overhead.To reduce the communication overhead and the completion time of a parallel application, we propose a Key Message model for parallel computing on Network of Workstations (NOW). In the Key Message model, all messages generated in a key message path are prioritized. A Key Message path in a task graph is de ned as the critical communication in the task graph, which is automatically identi ed by the Key Message algorithm. In this paper, we rst describe a queueing system model on which our approach is based, then introduce the algorithm that identi es the key message paths to be prioritized in a parallel application. The cost of the algorithm is also analyzed, and the performance of the algorithm is studied using a simulation."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C": {"external_link": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/trustcom/2012/4745z053/12OmNzzfTo5", "authors": ["Ryan KL Ko", "Markus Kirchberg", "Stephane Bressan", "Aloysius Cheang", "Liqun Chen", "Raymond Choo", "Debabrata Dash", "Elena Ferrari", "Terence Hung", "Yixin Jiang", "Kashif Kifayat", "Dirk Kuhlmann", "Bu Sung Lee", "Patrick PC Lee", "Sebastian Link", "John CS Lui", "Peter Martini", "Leonardo A Martucci", "Miranda Mowbray", "Valtteri Niemi", "Graeme Proudler", "Tomas Sander", "Thar Baker Shamsa", "Kian Lee Tan", "Joseph CM Teo", "Claire Vishik", "Guojun Wang", "Lena Wiese", "Peng Zhang", "Qing Zhang"], "description": "TSCloud Organizing and Program Committees Toggle navigation IEEE Computer Society \nDigital Library Jobs Tech News Resource Center Press Room Advertising About Us IEEE \nIEEE Computer Society IEEE Computer Society Digital Library My Subscriptions Magazines \nJournals Conference Proceedings Institutional Subscriptions IEEE IEEE Computer Society \nMore Jobs Tech News Resource Center Press Room Advertising About Us Cart All \nAdvanced Search Conference Cover Image Download 1.Home 2.Proceedings 3.trustcom \n2012 TSCloud Organizing and Program Committees 2012, pp. liii, DOI Bookmark: 10.1109/TrustCom.2012.316 \nKeywords Authors Abstract Provides a listing of current committee members.

This standard covers Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and Physical (PHY) layer of OSI (Open System Interconnection) model. Currently, the number of WLAN cards which support this standard is limited and on the other hand many users already have WLAN cards. We proposed a MAC-Independent service differentiation mechanism which is called Ad Hoc Qs. In this paper we compare the performance of IEEE 802.11 e and Ad Hoc Qs in service differentiation in wireless networks. The simulation results show that Ad Hoc Qs surpasses IEEE 802.11 e in some features: Firstly, Ad Hoc Qs is implemented just by software upgrade in contrast to IEEE 802.11 e which needs hardware upgrade. Secondly, By increasing the amount of high priority traffics, the low priority traffics will suffer from\u00a0\u2026"}}
