We provide an in depth look at the role of cuteness in interactive systems beginning with a history. We particularly focus on the Japanese culture of Kawaii, which has made a large impact around the world, especially in entertainment, fashion, and animation. We then take the approach of defining cuteness in contemporary popular perception.

Furthermore, there are relatively few studies on food waste reduction in the retail sector through mobile technologies. Therefore, we aim to introduce a mobile application, named Foodscover, designed to reduce food waste in the retail context by offering surplus food from retailers at a discounted price to the general public. The application would provide a platform for retailers to upload their surplus food items at a discounted price at the end of a shift.

In 2012, nearly 40,000 people were affected by Dengue with reports that the capital city of Colombo was the epicentre from which Dengue was spreading to different parts of the country. While Dengue prevention efforts by public health authorities have witnessed vast improvements over the past 5 years, the magnitude of the problem demands that existing systems be enhanced and strengthened. The unprecedented penetration of mobile phones and profusion of social media in Asia calls for the optimization of such technologies to address this issue.  Objectives 1) To understand the information flow related to Dengue case incidence among the public health authorities in Colombo; 2) To understand gaps in Dengue surveillance and education, and thereby examine informational and technological needs of public health inspectors (PHIs); 3) To obtain feedback from PHIs on the utility of a mobile, social media-based system in development by the team that integrates three components: a) predictive surveillance, b) civic engagement and c) health education.   Methods We conducted a mixed methods cross-sectional study among PHIs in Colombo, Sri Lanka. First, we conducted a 10-minute paper based survey that included demographics, technological self efficacy and information seeking behaviors of PHIs. Then, we conducted semi-structured interviews to understand the information flow (dynamics and challenges of identifying and reporting Dengue cases), educational activities related to Dengue, technology use and preferences, client interaction and\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Rog8AvUAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Rog8AvUAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC": {"external_link": "https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/13055", "authors": ["Natalie Pang", "Mikko J Rissanen", "Samantha Vu", "Owen Noel Newton Fernando", "Schubert Foo"], "publication_date": "2013", "description": "This study analyzes interaction techniques in previously proposed 16 user interface concepts that utilize the form factor of a finger-ring, i.e. \u201cringterfaces\u201d.

Further, John Gottman states that to form successful friendships, children needed to find common-ground activities, communicate clearly, exchange information, resolve conflict and engage in sharing of personal information [5]. In addition, sociocultural theories determined that direct interaction children have with peers and adults have a profound influence in the child development and participating effectively in society [6, 7]. Therefore, Petimo is designed to enhance their experience of building social circles and networking both in the physical and digital world in a secure and healthy environment.After understanding the developmental stage our target user, the key factor taken into consideration during the design process of Petimo robot is the user-friendliness with an interactive interface and natural gestures. The purpose is to give them a tool that encourages them in making friends in both physical and virtual world. The Petimo allows them to move effortlessly between the physical and virtual interactive spaces.

However, despite its nimble and flexible nature, social media has been applied to health issues in silos. By this, we mean that social media affordances have either been applied to addressing specific aspects of a health issue, or have focused on addressing one issue at a time, such as infectious diseases. Given the apparent commonalities in the technological characteristics of social media for health interventions, applying the same features to a distinct set of health issues leads to reinventing the wheel and, more important, redundancy in technological deliverables. This paper addresses this issue by proposing the general architecture of Health Suite, an integrative common platform built on a plug-and-play model for health-related social media solutions. We present summary findings from formative research studies that informed our idea, offer a detailed description of Health Suite and its various modules, and demonstrate how Health Suite\u2019s modules have been adapted for designing a social media-based dengue prevention intervention in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Furthermore, it will provide a means of expression in the language that children can understand, and the forms of social communication. BlogWall can also be used to educate the children while they interact and play with the system.
