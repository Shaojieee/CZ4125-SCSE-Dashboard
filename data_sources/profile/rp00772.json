in the literature. One example of these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find a set of objects in the database such that it covers a set of given keywords collectively and has the smallest cost. Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms have severe scalability problems and existing approximate algorithms, though scalable, cannot guarantee near-to-optimal solutions. In this paper, we study the CoSKQ problem and address the above issues. Firstly, we consider the CoSKQ problem using an existing cost measurement called the maximum sum cost. This problem is called MaxSum-CoSKQ and is known to be NP-hard. We observe that the maximum sum cost of a set of objects is dominated by at most three objects which we call the distance owners of the set. Motivated by this, we propose a distance owner-driven approach which\u00a0\u2026", "Trajectories of moving objects are collected in many applications. Raw trajectory data is typically very large, and has to be simplified before use. In this paper, we introduce the notion of direction-preserving trajectory simplification, and show both analytically and empirically that it can support a broader range of applications than traditional position-preserving trajectory simplification. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal direction-preserving simplification, and another approximate algorithm with a quality guarantee. Extensive experimental evaluation with real trajectory data shows the benefit of the new techniques.", "Peer review has become the most common practice for judging papers submitted to a conference for decades. An extremely important task involved in peer review is to assign submitted papers to reviewers with appropriate expertise which is referred to as paper-reviewer assignment. In this paper, we study the paper-reviewer assignment problem from both the goodness aspect and the fairness aspect. For the goodness aspect, we propose to maximize the topic coverage of the paper-reviewer assignment. This objective is new and the problem based on this objective is shown to be NP-hard. To solve this problem efficiently, we design an approximate algorithm which gives a 1/3-approximation. For the fairness aspect, we perform a detailed study on conflict-of-interest (COI) types and discuss several issues related to using COI, which, we hope, can raise some open discussions among researchers on the COI study\u00a0\u2026", "Online bipartite graph matching is attracting growing research attention due to the development of dynamic task assignment in sharing economy applications, where tasks need be assigned dynamically to workers. Past studies lack practicability in terms of both problem formulation and solution framework. On the one hand, some problem settings in prior online bipartite graph matching research are impractical for real-world applications. On the other hand, existing solutions to online bipartite graph matching are inefficient due to the unnecessary real-time decision making. In this paper, we propose the dynamic bipartite graph matching (DBGM) problem to be better aligned with real-world applications and devise a novel adaptive batch-based solution framework with a constant competitive ratio. As an effective and efficient implementation of the solution framework, we design a reinforcement learning based algorithm\u00a0\u2026", "Viral marketing has attracted considerable concerns in recent years due to its novel idea of leveraging the social network to propagate the awareness of products. Specifically, viral marketing is to first target a limited number of users (seeds) in the social network by providing incentives, and these targeted users would then initiate the process of awareness spread by propagating the information to their friends via their social relationships. Extensive studies have been conducted for maximizing the awareness spread given the number of seeds. However, all of them fail to consider the common scenario of viral marketing where companies hope to use as few seeds as possible yet influencing at least a certain number of users. In this paper, we propose a new problem, called J-MIN-Seed, whose objective is to minimize the number of seeds while at least J users are influenced.

Specifically, we have a road network on which some clients and servers are located. Each client finds the server that is closest to her for service and her cost of getting served is equal to the (network) distance between the client and the server serving her multiplied by her weight or importance. The optimal location query problem is to find a location for setting up a new server such that the maximum cost of clients being served by the servers (including the new server) is minimized. This problem has been studied before, but the state-of-the-art is still not efficient enough. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for the optimal location query problem, which is based on a novel idea of \\emph{nearest location component}. We also discuss three extensions of the optimal location query problem, namely the optimal multiple-location\u00a0\u2026", "Trajectory data is central to many applications with moving objects. Raw trajectory data is usually very large, and so is simplified before it is stored and processed. Many trajectory simplification notions have been proposed, and among them, the direction-preserving trajectory simplification (DPTS) which aims at protecting the direction information has been shown to perform quite well. However, existing studies on DPTS require users to specify an error tolerance which users might not know how to set properly in some cases (e.g., the error tolerance could only be known at some future time and simply setting one error tolerance does not meet the needs since the simplified trajectories would usually be used in many different applications which accept different error tolerances). In these cases, a better solution is to minimize the error while achieving a pre-defined simplification size.

Useful inherent features were automatically extracted from the historical TEC by LSTM layers, and the performance of the proposed model was enhanced by considering solar flux and geomagnetic activity data.

Today, fake news spans almost every realm of human activity, across diverse fields such as politics and healthcare. Most existing methods for fake news detection leverage supervised learning methods and expect a large labelled corpus of articles and social media user engagement information, which are often hard, time-consuming and costly to procure. In this paper, we consider the task of unsupervised fake news detection, which considers fake news detection in the absence of labelled historical data. We develop GTUT, a graph-based approach for the task which operates in three phases. Starting off with identifying a seed set of fake and legitimate articles exploiting high-level observations on inter-user behavior in fake news propagation, it progressively\u00a0\u2026", "Accurate and updated road network data is vital in many urban applications, such as car-sharing, and logistics. The traditional approach to identifying the road network, ie, field survey, requires a significant amount of time and effort. With the wide usage of GPS embedded devices, a huge amount of trajectory data has been generated by different types of mobile objects, which provides a new opportunity to extract the underlying road network. However, the existing trajectory-based map recovery approaches require many empirical parameters and do not utilize the prior knowledge in existing maps, which over-simplifies or over-complicates the reconstructed road network. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based map generation framework, ie, DeepMG, which learns the structure of the existing road network to overcome the noisy GPS positions. More specifically, DeepMG extracts features from trajectories in both spatial view and transition view and uses a convolutional deep neural network T2RNet to infer road centerlines. After that, a trajectory-based post-processing algorithm is proposed to refine the topological connectivity of the recovered map. Extensive experiments on two real-world trajectory datasets confirm that DeepMG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "Extracting interesting tuples from a large database is an important problem in multi-criteria decision making. Two representative queries were proposed in the literature: top- k queries and skyline queries. A top- k query requires users to specify their utility functions beforehand and then returns k tuples to the users. A skyline query does not require any utility function from users but it puts no control on the number of tuples returned to users. Recently, a k-regret query was proposed and received attention from the community because it does not require any utility function from users and the output size is controllable, and thus it avoids those deficiencies of top- k queries and skyline queries. Specifically, it returns k tuples that minimize a criterion called the maximum regret ratio . In this paper, we present the lower bound of the maximum regret ratio for the k -regret query. Besides, we propose a novel algorithm, called\u00a0\u2026", "In modern process industries, many parameters or states can be acquired with sensors, and these parameters or states often have a close relationship with operation conditions. Unfortunately, the process often operates under different modes, and labels thereof are often unknown. In practice, labeling for sampled data is expensive and time-consuming, so identifying the operation conditions of the industrial process is difficult. In addition, sampled data from the industrial system are always contaminated by outliers or noise. Therefore, a robust process monitoring method for the multimode process is particularly important and challenging. In this paper, a robust dictionary learning method is proposed for processes with multiple unknown modes. Firstly, by taking the sparsity of outliers into account, a robust dictionary learning method is proposed to identify and remove the outliers and noise in the sampled training data\u00a0\u2026", "Mobility prediction, which is to predict where a user will arrive based on the user's historical mobility records, has attracted much attention. We argue that it is more useful to know not only where but also when a user will arrive next in many scenarios such as targeted advertising and taxi service. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware deep model called DeepJMT for jointly performing mobility prediction (to know where) and time prediction (to know when). The DeepJMT model consists of (1) a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) based sequential dependency encoder, which is more capable of capturing a user's mobility regularities and temporal patterns compared to vanilla RNN based models; (2) a spatial context extractor and a periodicity context extractor to extract location semantics and the user's periodicity, respectively; and (3) a co-attention based social & temporal context extractor which\u00a0\u2026", "Earthquakes have become one of the leading causes of death from natural hazards in the last fifty years. Continuous efforts have been made to understand the physical characteristics of earthquakes and the interaction between the physical hazards and the environments so that appropriate warnings may be generated before earthquakes strike. However, earthquake forecasting is not trivial at all. Reliable forecastings should include the analysis and the signals indicating the coming of a significant quake. Unfortunately, these signals are rarely evident before earthquakes occur, and therefore it is challenging to detect such precursors in seismic analysis. Among the available technologies for earthquake research, remote sensing has been commonly used due to its unique features such as fast imaging and wide image-acquisition range. Nevertheless, early studies on pre-earthquake and remote-sensing anomalies\u00a0\u2026", "Forecasting the motion of surrounding obstacles (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and etc.) benefits the on-road motion planning for intelligent and autonomous vehicles. Complex scenes always yield great challenges in modeling the patterns of surrounding traffic. For example, one main challenge comes from the intractable interaction effects in a complex traffic system. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer architecture Interaction-aware Kalman Neural Networks (IaKNN) which involves an interaction layer for resolving high-dimensional traffic environmental observations as interaction-aware accelerations, a motion layer for transforming the accelerations to interaction-aware trajectories, and a filter layer for estimating future trajectories with a Kalman filter network. Attributed to the multiple traffic data sources, our end-to-end trainable approach technically fuses dynamic and interaction-aware trajectories boosting the\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of commercial tracking systems, sports data is being generated at an unprecedented speed and the interest in sports play retrieval has grown dramatically as well. However, it is challenging to design an effective, efficient and robust similarity measure for sports play retrieval. To this end, we propose a deep learning approach to learn the representations of sports plays, called play2vec, which is robust against noise and takes only linear time to compute the similarity between two sports plays. We conduct experiments on real-world soccer match data, and the results show that our solution performs more effectively and efficiently compared with the state-of-the-art methods.", "Bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor (BRNN) queries have been studied extensively in the literature of spatial databases. Given a set P of service-providers and a set O of customers, a BRNN query is to find which customers in O are \"interested\" in a given service-provider in P. Recently, it has been found that this kind of queries lacks the consideration of the capacities of service-providers and the demands of customers. In order to address this issue, some spatial matching problems have been proposed, which, however, cannot be used for some real-life applications like emergency facility allocation where the maximum matching cost (or distance) should be minimized. In this paper, we propose a new problem called Spatial Matching for Minimizing Maximum matching distance (SPM-MM). Then, we design two algorithms for SPM-MM, Threshold-Adapt and Swap-Chain.

One example of spatial-keyword query is the so-called collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find for a given query consisting a query location and several query keywords a set of objects which covers the query keywords collectively and has the smallest costwrt the query location. In the literature, many different functions were proposed for defining the cost and correspondingly, many different approaches were developed for the CoSKQ problem. In this paper, we study the CoSKQ problem systematically by proposing a unified cost function and a unified approach for the CoSKQ problem (with the unified cost function). The unified cost function includes all existing cost functions as special cases and the unified approach solves the CoSKQ problem with\u00a0\u2026", "There are a bulk of studies on proposing algorithms for composing the melody of a song automatically with algorithms, which is known as algorithmic composition. To the best of our knowledge, none of them took the lyric into consideration for melody composition. However, according to some recent studies, within a song, there usually exists a certain extent of correlation between its melody and its lyric. In this demonstration, we propose to utilize this type of correlation information for melody composition. Based on this idea, we design a new melody composition algorithm and develop a melody composer called T-Music which employs this composition algorithm.", "The rapid development of e-commerce requires efficient and reliable logistics services. Nowadays, couriers are still the main solution to address the \"last mile\" problem in logistics. They are usually required to record the accurate delivery time of each parcel manually, which provides vital information for applications like delivery insurances, delivery performance evaluations, and customer available time discovery. Couriers' trajectories generated by their PDAs provide a chance to infer the delivery time automatically to ease the burdens on the couriers. However, directly using the nearest stay point to infer the delivery time is under satisfactory due to two challenges: 1) inaccurate delivery locations, and 2) various stay scenarios. To this end, we propose Delivery Time Inference (DTInf), to automatically infer the delivery time of waybills based on couriers' trajectories.

One important research direction about trajectory data is the anomaly detection which is to find all anomalies based on trajectory patterns in a road network.

Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can be utilized to compensate such power variations due to their aggregated and controllable power consumptions. Meanwhile, one basic requirement for the users\u2019 side of TCLs is to realize the fair sharing of power states and comfort states. This article proposes a distributed event-based control strategy, where information of neighboring TCLs is exchanged only when a dynamic event-triggered condition is satisfied, and thus it intelligently determines the necessary transmission frequency to save communication resources. From a cybersecurity perspective, the communication network of TCLs may be subject to hybrid attacks, for example, denial-of-service (DoS) and false data-injection (FDI) attacks.

However, the similar subtrajectory search (SimSub) problem, aiming to return a portion of a trajectory (i.e., a subtrajectory) which is the most similar to a query trajectory, has been mostly disregarded despite that it could capture trajectory similarity in a finer-grained way and many applications take subtrajectories as basic units for analysis. In this paper, we study the SimSub problem and develop a suite of algorithms including both exact and approximate ones. Among those approximate algorithms, two that are based on deep reinforcement learning stand out and outperform those non-learning based algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We conduct experiments on real-world trajectory datasets, which verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "Co-location patterns are well-established on spatial objects with categorical labels, which capture the phenomenon that objects with certain labels are often located in close geographic proximity. Similar to frequent itemsets, co-location patterns are defined based on a support measure which quantifies the popularity (or prevalence) of a pattern candidate (a label set). Quite a few support measures exist for defining co-location patterns and they share an idea of counting the number of instances of a given label set C as its support, where an instance of C is an object set whose objects carry all the labels in C and are located close to one another. Unfortunately, these measures suffer from various weaknesses, e.g., some fail to capture all possible instances while some others overlook the cases when multiple instances overlap.

These items and entities are mentioned in order following the development of a dialogue. In other words, potential sequential dependencies exist in conversations. However, most of the existing CRSs neglect these potential sequential dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based sequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, which models the sequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. We represent conversations by items and entities, and construct user sequences to discover user preferences by considering both mentioned items and entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy a Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that our TSCR model\u00a0\u2026", "The low-altitude satellite DEMETER recorded many cases of ionospheric perturbations observed on occasion of large seismic events. In this paper, we explore 16 spot-checking classification algorithms, among which, the top classifier with low-frequency power spectra of electric and magnetic fields was used for ionospheric perturbation analysis. This study included the analysis of satellite data spanning over six years, during which about 8760 earthquakes with magnitude greater than or equal to 5.0 occurred in the world. We discover that among these methods, a gradient boosting-based method called LightGBM outperforms others and achieves superior performance in a five-fold cross-validation test on the benchmarking datasets, which shows a strong capability in discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations. The results show that the electromagnetic pre-earthquake data within a circular region with its center at the epicenter and its radius given by the Dobrovolsky\u2019s formula and the time window of about a few hours before shocks are much better at discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations. Moreover, by investigating different earthquake databases, we confirm that some low-frequency electric and magnetic fields\u2019 frequency bands are the dominant features for electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations identification. We have also found that the choice of the geographical region used to simulate the training set of non-seismic data influences, to a certain extent, the performance of the LightGBM model, by reducing its capability in discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations.", "With the proliferation of spatial-textual data such as location-based services and geo-tagged websites, spatial keyword queries become popular in the literature. One example of these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find a set of objects in the database such that it covers a given set of query keywords collectively and has the smallest cost. Some existing cost functions were proposed in the literature, which capture different aspects of the distances among the objects in the set and the query. However, we observe that in some applications, each object has an inherent cost (e.g., workers have monetary costs) which are not captured by any of the existing cost functions. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new cost function called the maximum dot size cost which captures both the distances among objects in a set and a query as existing cost functions do and the inherent\u00a0\u2026", "Existing network embedding algorithms based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) improve the robustness of node embeddings by selecting high-quality negative samples with the generator to play against the discriminator. Since most of the negative samples can be easily discriminated from positive samples in graphs, their poor competitiveness weakens the function of the generator. Inspired by the sales skills in the market, in this article, we present tripartite adversarial training for network embeddings (TriATNE), a novel adversarial learning framework for learning stable and robust node embeddings. TriATNE consists of three players: 1) producer; 2) seller; and 3) customer. The producer strives to learn the representation of each sample (node pair), making it easy for the customer to differentiate between the positive and the negative, while the seller tries to confuse the customer by selecting realistic\u00a0\u2026", "Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) facilitates domain-independent discovery of relational facts from large corpora.

In this survey, we provide an extensive overview of the-state-of-the-art neural OpenIE models, their key design decisions, strengths and weakness. Then, we discuss limitations of current solutions and the open issues in OpenIE problem itself.

Specifically, we first propose a traffic context aware skip-gram module to incorporate auxiliary tasks of predicting the traffic context of a target road segment. Furthermore, we propose a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module that utilizes trajectory data to extract traveling semantics on road networks. Apart from obtaining effective road segment representations, this module also enables us to obtain the route representations. With these two modules, we can learn representations which can capture multi-faceted characteristics of road networks to be applied in both road segment based applications and trajectory based applications.

To address this issue, the present work proposes an online dictionary learning method, which can fulfill the process monitoring and fault diagnosis task adaptively. The proposed method would incorporate currently available information to update the dictionary and control limit, instead of keeping a fixed monitoring model. The online dictionary learning method are more superior than conventional methods. Firstly, compared with some traditional offline methods based on small amounts of historical data, the proposed method can augment train data with online dictionary updating, thus it copes with time-varying processes well.

Specifically, given a road network containing clients and servers, an optimal location query finds a location on the road network such that when a new server is set up at this location, a certain cost function computed based on the clients and servers (including the new server) is optimized. Two types of cost functions, namely, MinMax and MaxSum, have been used for this query. The optimal location query problem with MinMax as the cost function is called the MinMax query, which finds a location for setting up a new server such that the maximum cost of a client being served by his/her closest server is minimized. The optimal location query problem with MaxSum as the cost function is called the MaxSum query, which finds a location for setting up a new server such that the sum of the weights of clients attracted by the new server is maximized\u00a0\u2026", "Learned indexes have been proposed to replace classic index structures like B-Tree with machine learning (ML) models.

In contrast, we propose a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to build a better R-Tree without the need to change the structure or query processing algorithms of traditional R-Tree. Specifically, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building and updating an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic rules currently used by the R-Tree and its variants.

Existing algorithms usually involve some decision making tasks (e.g., deciding which point to drop), for which, some human-crafted rules are used. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy for the decision making tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop trajectory simplification methods based on the learned policy.

However, existing Pregel-like systems only adopt a na\u00efve checkpointing approach for fault tolerance, which saves a large amount of data about the state of computation and significantly degrades the failure-free execution performance. Advanced fault tolerance/recovery techniques are left unexplored in the context of Pregel-like systems. This paper proposes a non-invasive lightweight checkpointing (LWCP) scheme which minimizes the data saved to each checkpoint, and additional data required for recovery are generated online from the saved data. This improvement results in 10x speedup in checkpointing, and an integration of it with a recently proposed log-based recovery approach can further speed up recovery when failure occurs.

SACN is made up of three modules, namely feature extraction module, selective-comparison similarity module (SCSM), and classification module: feature extraction module extracts the distinctive information into feature maps, SCSM is used to fuse the features of support set with those of the query set based on selective comparison. Considering the noisy background and tiny differences between different categories, we apply SCSM to fuse these features by arranging different weights pixel by pixel, and all these weights are learned automatically.

Data pertaining to the changes in the ionosphere may be obtained by satellites, and the analysis of data anomalies can help identify earthquake precursors. In this paper, we present a deep-learning model, SeqNetQuake, that uses data from the first China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) to identify ionospheric perturbations prior to earthquakes. SeqNetQuake achieves the best performance (F-measure (F1) = 0.6792 and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.427) when directly trained on the CSES dataset with a spatial window centered on the earthquake epicenter with the Dobrovolsky radius and an input sequence length of 20 consecutive observations during night time. We further explore a transferring learning approach, which initially trains the model with the larger Electro\u2010Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from the Earthquake Regions (DEMETER) dataset, and then tunes the model with the CSES dataset. The transfer-learning performance is substantially higher than that of direct learning, yielding a 12% improvement in the F1 score and a 29% improvement in the MCC value. Moreover, we compare the proposed model SeqNetQuake with other five benchmarking classifiers on an independent test set, which shows that SeqNetQuake demonstrates a 64.2% improvement in MCC and approximately a 24.5% improvement in the F1 score over the second-best convolutional neural network model.

In this paper, we focus on one kind of cohesive structure, called   -biplex, where each vertex of one side is disconnected from at most    vertices of the other side. We consider the large maximal   -biplex enumeration problem which is to list all those maximal   -biplexes with the number of vertices at each side at least a non-negative integer   . This formulation, we observe, has various applications and targets to find non-redundant results by excluding non-maximal ones. Existing approaches suffer from massive redundant computations and can only run on small and moderate datasets.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Adversarial Two-tower Neural Network (ATNN) model for new arrivals CTR predictions by introducing an adversarial network to a two-tower network. We design a generator and a discriminator to better learn an item vector based on item profiles without item statistics.

Furthermore, brine volume minimisation (BVM) simplifies brine treatment prior to disposal and hence, alleviates potential environmental concerns. However, BVM is not widely applied, as it is generally more energy intensive and costly. This may change in the future, as new high-recovery membrane processes, such as split-feed osmotically assisted reverse osmosis (SF-OARO), can potentially lower the required operating pressure and the energy consumption associated with brine dewatering via osmotic counterbalance. In addition, the added flexibility of OARO integrated systems may further reduce the unit water cost (UWC) in regions with varying-electricity tariffs. To verify these hypothesised advantages of OARO, this study explores the economic and technical viability of SF-OARO.

The upper bounds of the communication uncertainties are not required in the design, and the adaptive tuning of coupling weights is proved to be able to compensate for the adverse effects caused by uncertainties in the consensus-seeking phase.

While the study was conducted in the USA, the nature and size of challenges that it poses elsewhere are along similar lines. Fake news has destabilized governments, undermined trust in institutions all over the world, and sowed seeds of disharmony in the global society.

Nevertheless, it is non-trivial given the complex delivery circumstances, location heterogeneity, and skewed observations in space. The existing solution trains a supervised model based on aggregated features extracted from parcels to deliver, which cannot handle above challenges well. In this paper, we propose MetaSTP, a meta-learning based neural network model to predict the service time.

Existing methods suffer from efficiency and/or scalability issues and have the time of waiting for the next output exponential w.r.t. the size of the input bipartite graph (i.e., an exponential delay). In this paper, we adopt a reverse search framework called bTraversal, which corresponds to a depth-first search (DFS) procedure on an implicit solution graph on top of all maximal k-biplexes. We then develop a series of techniques for improving and implementing this framework including (1) carefully selecting an initial solution to start DFS, (2) pruning the vast majority of links\u00a0\u2026", "In many commercial campaigns, we observe that there exists a tradeoff between the number of customers satisfied by the company and the profit gained. Merely satisfying as many customers as possible or maximizing the profit is not desirable.

Given a set P of products and a set O of customers, k-SAMP is to find an assignment between P and O such that at least k customers are satisfied in the assignment and the profit incurred by this assignment is maximized. Although we find that this problem is closely related to two classic computer science problems, namely maximum weight matching and maximum matching, the techniques developed for these classic problems cannot be adapted to our k-SAMP problem.

To mitigate the insufficiency of Geocoding, some methods have been proposed, which utilize couriers' locations when waybills are confirmed to be delivered for delivery location inference. Nevertheless, these methods highly rely on the quality of couriers' annotations and fail when couriers confirm deliveries with delays. We propose to infer actual delivery locations of addresses from couriers' trajectories. This idea lies on an observation that the semantics of delivering a parcel are well captured by couriers' trajectories (e.g., a stay point would be generated when a delivery\u00a0\u2026", "Modern information-seeking systems are becoming more interactive, mainly through asking Clarifying Questions (CQs) to refine users\u2019 information needs.

Existing solutions for similar play retrieval usually assume that a database of plays are materialized, which, however, is not well aligned with the practice that data is stored in units of game. In this paper, we propose to search for similar plays directly from a database of games. We tackle three challenges of the task, namely (1) how to measure the similarity between two plays, (2) how to efficiently find a similar play to a query play within a game, and (3) how to efficiently find a similar play within a database of many games.

ANE is based on two hypotheses: 1) nodes in closed triplets are more important than nodes in open triplets and 2) closed triplets with higher degrees are more important. In addition, we change the bidirectional sampling of Word2vec into directional sampling to preserve the frequency of node pairs in the training set. Three common tasks, network reconstruction, link prediction, and classification are conducted on various publicly available data sets to\u00a0\u2026", "Geo-textual data is ubiquitous nowadays, where each object has a location and is associated with some keywords. Many types of queries based on geo-textual data, termed as spatial keyword queries, have been proposed, and are to find optimal object(s) in terms of both its (their) location(s) and keywords. In this paper, we propose a new type of query called nearby-fit spatial keyword query (NSKQ), where an optimal object is defined based not only on the location and the keywords of the object itself, but also on those of the objects nearby. For example, in an application of finding a hotel, not only the location of a hotel but also the objects near the hotel (e.g., shopping malls, restaurants, and bus stops nearby) might need to be taken into consideration. The query is proved to be NP-hard, and in order to perform the query efficiently, we developed two approximate algorithms with small constant approximation factors\u00a0\u2026", "Recently, the topic of graph representation learning has received plenty of attention. Existing approaches usually focus on structural properties only and thus they are not sufficient for those spatial graphs where the nodes are associated with some spatial information. In this paper, we present the first deep learning approach called s2vec for learning spatial graph representations, which is based on denoising autoencoders framework (DAF). We evaluate the learned representations on real datasets and the results verified the effectiveness of s2vec when used for spatial clustering.", "To index multi-dimensional data, space-filling curves (SFCs) have been used to map the data to one dimension, and then a one-dimensional indexing method such as the B-tree is used to index the mapped data. The existing SFCs all adopt a single mapping scheme for the whole data space. However, a single mapping scheme often does not perform well on all the data space. In this paper, we propose a new type of SFC called piecewise SFCs, which adopts different mapping schemes for different data subspaces. Specifically, we propose a data structure called Bit Merging tree (BMTree), which can generate data subspaces and their SFCs simultaneously and achieve desirable properties of the SFC for the whole data space. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning based solution to build the BMTree, aiming to achieve excellent query performance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method\u00a0\u2026", "Finding frequent subgraph patterns in a big graph is an important problem with many applications such as classifying chemical compounds and building indexes to speed up graph queries. Since this problem is NP-hard, some recent parallel systems have been developed to accelerate the mining. However, they often have a huge memory cost, very long running time, suboptimal load balancing, and possibly inaccurate results. In this paper, we propose an efficient system called T-FSM for parallel mining of frequent subgraph patterns in a big graph. T-FSM adopts a novel task-based execution engine design to ensure high concurrency, bounded memory consumption, and effective load balancing. It also supports a new anti-monotonic frequentness measure called Fraction-Score, which is more accurate than the widely used MNI measure. Our experiments show that T-FSM is orders of magnitude faster than SOTA\u00a0\u2026", "Enumerating maximal k-biplexes (MBPs) of a bipartite graph has been used for applications such as fraud detection. Nevertheless, there usually exists an exponential number of MBPs, which brings up two issues when enumerating MBPs, namely the effectiveness issue (many MBPs are of low values) and the efficiency issue (enumerating all MBPs is not affordable on large graphs). Existing proposals of tackling this problem impose constraints on the number of vertices of each MBP to be enumerated, yet they are still not sufficient (e.g., they require to specify the constraints, which is often not user-friendly, and cannot control the number of MBPs to be enumerated directly). Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of finding K MBPs with the most edges called MaxBPs, where K is a positive integral user parameter. The new proposal well avoids the drawbacks of existing proposals (i.e., the number of MBPs to be\u00a0\u2026", "Road extraction is a process of automatically generating road maps mainly from satellite images. Existing models all target to generate roads from the scratch despite that a large number of road maps, though incomplete, are publicly available [e.g., those from OpenStreetMap (OSM)] and can help with road extraction. In this article, we propose to conduct road extraction based on satellite images and partial road maps, which is new. We then propose a two-branch partial-to-complete network (P2CNet) for the task, which has two prominent components: gated self-attention module (GSAM) and missing part (MP) loss. GSAM leverages a channelwise self-attention module and a gate module to capture long-range semantics, filter out useless information, and better fuse the features from two branches. An MP loss is derived from the partial road maps, trying to give more attention to the road pixels that do not exist in partial\u00a0\u2026", "Due to the advance of the geo-spatial positioning and the computer graphics technology, digital terrain data has become increasingly popular nowadays. Query processing on terrain data has attracted considerable attention from both the academic and the industry communities.Proximity queries such as the shortest path/distance query, k nearest/farthest neighbor query, and top-k closest/farthest pairs query are fundamental and important queries in the context of the terrain surfaces, and they have a lot of applications in Geographical Information System, 3D object feature vector construction, and 3D object data mining. In this article, we first study the most fundamental type of query, namely, shortest distance and path query, which is to find the shortest distance and path between two points of interest on the surface of the terrain. As observed by existing studies, computing the exact shortest distance/path is very\u00a0\u2026", "Given a data matrix   , a submatrix    of    is an order-preserving submatrix (OPSM) if there is a permutation of the columns of   , under which the entry values of each row in    are strictly increasing. OPSM mining is widely used in real-life applications such as identifying coexpressed genes and finding customers with similar preference. However, noise is ubiquitous in real data matrices due to variable experimental conditions and measurement errors, which makes conventional OPSM mining algorithms inapplicable. No previous work on OPSM has ever considered uncertain value intervals using the well-established possible world semantics. We establish two different definitions of significant OPSMs based on the possible world semantics: (1)\u00a0expected support-based and (2)\u00a0probabilistic frequentness-based.

However, it has been a long-existing challenge that single source of trajectory data is biased in terms of its spatiotemporal coverage. In this paper, we leverage two types of large traffic datasets - point flows and sample trajectories - to generate the full city-scale vehicular paths. Our method consists of a low-granularity data fusion (LGDF) module, which uses point flow data to estimate the sparse paths that pass through some specific links (where sensors are mounted), and a high-granularity model training (HGMT) component, which uses sample trajectory data to pre-train a bi-gram sequence generation model. Afterwards, the results from LGDF and HGMT are combined to produce detailed on-road spatiotemporal paths. In this way, the data safety of single trajectory is protected\u00a0\u2026", "Searchable symmetric encryption enables a cloud server to answer queries directly over encrypted data. Two key requirements are a strong security guarantee and a sub-linear search performance. The bucketization approach in the literature addresses these requirements at the expense of downloading false positives and requiring the local search at the client side. In this article, we propose a novel approach to meet these requirements while minimizing the clients work and communication cost. First, a relaxed notion of ciphertext indistinguishability on partitioned data is formalized, called class indistinguishability, which provides a level of ciphertext indistinguishability similar to that of bucketization but allows the server to perform search of relevant data and filter false positives. We present a construction for achieving these goals through a two-phase search algorithm. The first phase finds a candidate set through a\u00a0\u2026", "Online social network (OSN) analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Edge and triangle counts are both fundamental properties in OSNs. However, for many OSNs, one can only access parts of the network using the application programming interfaces (APIs). In such cases, conventional algorithms become infeasible. In this paper, we introduce efficient algorithms for estimating the number of edges and triangles in OSNs based on random walk sampling on OSNs. We also derive a theoretical bound on the sample size and number of APIs calls needed in our algorithms for a probabilistic accuracy guarantee. We ran experiments on several publicly available real-world networks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.", "Hyperspheres are commonly used for representing uncertain objects (in uncertain databases) and for indexing spatial objects (in spatial databases). An interesting operator on hyperspheres called dominance is to decide for two given hyperspheres whether one dominates (or is closer than) the other wrt a given query hypersphere. In this paper, we propose an approach called Hyperbola which is optimal in the sense that it gives neither false positives nor false negatives and runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality. To the best of our knowledge, Hyperbola is the first optimal approach for the dominance problem on hyperespheres with any dimensionality. We also study an application of the dominance problem which relies on the dominance operator as the core component. We conducted extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets which verified our approaches.", "In the scene of self-supervised graph learning, Mutual Information (MI) was recently introduced for graph encoding to generate robust node embeddings. A successful representative is Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), which essentially operates on the space of node features but ignores topological structures, and just considers global graph summary. In this paper, we present an effective model called Deep Graph Structural Infomax (DGSI) to learn node representation. We explore to derive the structural mutual information from the perspective of Information Bottleneck (IB), which defines a trade-off between the sufficiency and minimality of representation on the condition of the topological structure preservation. Intuitively, the derived constraints formally maximize the structural mutual information both edge-wise and local neighborhood-wise. Besides, we develop a general framework that incorporates the global representational mutual information, local representational mutual information, and sufficient structural information into the node representation. Essentially, our DGSI extends DGI and could capture more fine-grained semantic information as well as beneficial structural information in a self-supervised manner, thereby improving node representation and further boosting the learning performance. Extensive experiments on different types of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.", "Computing the densest subgraph is a primitive graph operation with critical applications in detecting communities, events, and anomalies in biological, social, Web, and financial networks. In this paper, we study the novel problem of Most Probable Densest Subgraph (MPDS) discovery in uncertain graphs: Find the node set that is the most likely to induce a densest subgraph in an uncertain graph. We further extend our problem by considering various notions of density, e.g., clique and pattern densities, studying the top-k MPDSs, and finding the node set with the largest containment probability within densest subgraphs. We show that it is #P-hard to compute the probability of a node set inducing a densest subgraph. We then devise sampling-based efficient algorithms, with end-to-end accuracy guarantees, to compute the MPDS.

While many approaches have been proposed for this task, they suffer from various issues including (1) incapability of detecting anomalous subtrajectories, which are finer-grained anomalies in trajectory data, and/or (2) non-data driven, and/or (3) requirement of sufficient supervision labels which are costly to collect. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based solution called RL4OASD, which avoids all aforementioned issues of existing approaches. RL4OASD involves two networks, one responsible for learning features of road networks and trajectories and the other responsible for detecting anomalous subtrajectories based on the learned features, and the two networks can be trained iteratively without labeled data.

What\u2019s more, there are multiaspect representations of entities in HINs, and a filter learned in one aspect do not necessarily apply to another. We address these challenges by proposing the Aspect-Aware Graph Attention Network (AGAT), a model that extends GCNs with alternative learnable filters to incorporate entity and relational information. Instead of focusing on learning the general entity embeddings, AGAT learns the adaptive entity embeddings\u00a0\u2026", "The phenomena of data missing are common in the field of traffic, yet existing solutions for data imputation are not sufficient due to challenges of data sparsity, complex traffic situations and the lack of complete ground truths. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called STCPA for the speed imputation problem. STCPA captures complex traffic correlations among the spatial and temporal dimensions via the attention mechanism, which helps mitigate the data sparsity issue. In addition, STCPA adopts an imputation cycle consistency constraint for providing reliable supervisions on unobserved entries, which improves the training. Furthermore, it incorporates an extra Road-aware Perceptual Loss, which helps encourage to preserve more meaningful semantics for imputation.

Our study of the literature in this domain shows that most of the task assignment algorithms developed for spatial crowdsourcing platforms address the problem from a utilitarian perspective, i.e., they optimise for only kind of entity. In contrast, we address the task assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing platforms from an egalitarian perspective. An egalitarian approach aims to optimise the expectation of all entities involved. Specifically, we aim to minimise the waiting time for the customers and workers, while maximising the profit earned by the platform. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only study that achieves this\u00a0\u2026", "Bipartite matching between two sets of objects is widely applied in many applications such as crowdsourcing marketplaces, ride-hailing services and logistics. Depending on the applications, different objectives have been proposed, resulting in different matching problems. Among them, one that is recently proposed is online bottleneck matching with delays (OBM-D), where the objective is to optimize the maximum cost of matches and the cost of a match depends on when the match is formed (i.e., it is delay-aware). Existing solutions for OBM-D usually adopt a holding strategy, which holds the objects involved in a match available for a period so as to reduce the chance that a bad match is formed. Nevertheless, existing holding strategies are all based on human-crafted rules thus cannot adapt to the dynamics of how the objects arrive. In this paper, we propose an adaptive holding strategy which is based on\u00a0\u2026", "Fact checking, which verifies whether a given statement is true, could play a vital role in fake news detection. For example, for a given piece of news, a potential solution could involve a series of steps, including extracting statements from the news via text parsing, checking the validity of the extracted statements (i.e., fact checking), and classifying the news as fake if some statements have been confirmed to be false and performing further fake news detection processes otherwise. Considering that knowledge graphs are a popular way of representing knowledge, which could be used for verifying or counter-verifying statements, several solutions have been proposed that make use of knowledge graphs for fact checking. In this chapter, recent studies on fact checking with the help of knowledge graphs are reviewed, and three representative solutions, namely, Knowledge Linker, PredPath, and Knowledge Stream, are\u00a0\u2026", "The notion of node similarity is useful in many real-world applications. Many existing similarity measurements such as SimRank and its variants have been proposed. Among these measurements, most capture the structural information of a graph only, and thus they are not suitable for graphs with additional label information. We propose a new similarity measurement called LSimRank which measures the similarities among nodes by using both the structural information and the label information of a graph. Extensive experiments on datasets verify that LSimRank is superior over SimRank and other variants on labeled graphs.", "Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a remote cloud server to answer queries directly over encrypted data on a client\u2019s behalf, therefore, relieves the resource limited client from complicated data management tasks. Two key requirements are a strong security guarantee and a sub-linear search performance. The bucketization approach in the literature addresses these requirements at the expense of downloading many false positives or requiring the client to search relevant bucket ids locally, which limits the applicability of the method. In this paper, we propose a novel approach CLASS to meet these requirements for equality conjunction search while minimizing the client work and communication cost. First, we generalize the standard ciphertext indistinguishability to partitioned data, called class indistinguishability, which provides a level of ciphertext indistinguishability similar to that of\u00a0\u2026", "Online social networks (OSNs) embed a rich set of information that could be used in a few fields. Extensive research has been done on estimating graph properties such as counts of wedges and triangles in OSNs. While these graph properties which are defined based on the structural information only are useful at a coarse level, they are not sufficient in applications where finegrained information is desired. In this paper, we study a problem of estimating a type of graph property, namely the count of edges, refined by the labels of the users, which are usually available in users\u2019 profiles, and serves as finer-grained information. Existing solutions for estimating graph properties pay no attention on users\u2019 labels and thus they are not suitable for many real world applications. We develop two algorithms for the problem, each of which samples a set of edges or nodes via a random walk process and construct estimators based on the sampled edges or nodes. Theoretical analysis on the accuracy guarantees of our algorithms and extensive experiments based on real datasets verify that our algorithms are superior over baseline algorithms.", "Algorithmic composition refers to the process of composing a melody automatically using algorithms. A bulk of methods have been proposed for this task. Among them, a novel idea is to utilize the correlation information between the pitches of melodies and the tones of lyrics for melody composition. Unfortunately, the existing method adopting this idea suffers from several severe shortcomings and thus the merits of the above idea are not fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a new technique to capture the above correlation information based on the concepts of pitch trends and tone trends. Based on this technique, we design a new algorithm called Trend-MC for melody composition which avoids the shortcomings of the existing method. We also developed a software with the Trend-MC algorithm as its core. We demonstrate that the software could compose nice melodies with the input of lyrics.", "Mining cohesive subgraphs from a graph is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. One notable cohesive structure is -quasi-clique (QC), where each vertex connects at least a fraction  of the other vertices inside. Enumerating maximal -quasi-cliques (MQCs) of a graph has been widely studied. One common practice of finding all MQCs is to (1) find a set of QCs containing all MQCs and then (2) filter out non-maximal QCs. While quite a few algorithms have been developed (which are branch-and-bound algorithms) for finding a set of QCs that contains all MQCs, all focus on sharpening the pruning techniques and devote little effort to improving the branching part. As a result, they provide no guarantee on pruning branches and all have the worst-case time complexity of , where  suppresses the polynomials and  is the number of vertices in the graph. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding a set of QCs containing all MQCs but deviate from further sharpening the pruning techniques as existing methods do. We pay attention to both the pruning and branching parts and develop new pruning techniques and branching methods that would suit each other better towards pruning more branches both theoretically and practically. Specifically, we develop a new branch-and-bound algorithm called FastQC based on newly developed pruning techniques and branching methods, which improves the worst-case time complexity to , where  is a positive real number strictly smaller than 2. Furthermore, we develop a divide-and-conquer strategy for boosting the performance of FastQC.

In practice, the ST data generation is usually influenced by various latent factors tied to natural phenomena or human socioeconomic activities, impacting specific spatial areas selectively. However, existing ST prediction methods usually do not refine the impacts of different factors, but directly model the entangled impacts of multiple factors. This amplifies the modeling complexity of ST data and compromises model interpretability. To this end, we propose a multi-factor ST prediction task that predicts partial ST data evolution under different factors, and combines them for a final prediction. We make two contributions to this task: an effective theoretical solution and a portable instantiation framework. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical solution called decomposed prediction strategy and prove its effectiveness from the perspective of information entropy theory. On top of that, we instantiate a novel model-agnostic framework, named spatio-temporal graph decomposition learning (STGDL), for multi-factor ST prediction. The framework consists of two main components: an automatic graph decomposition module that decomposes the original graph structure inherent in ST data into subgraphs corresponding to different factors, and a decomposed learning network that learns the partial ST data on each subgraph separately and integrates them for the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world ST datasets of two types of graphs, i.e., grid graph and\u00a0\u2026", "Infectious diseases, such as Black Death, Spanish Flu, and COVID-19, have accompanied human history and threatened public health, resulting in enormous infections and even deaths among citizens. Because of their rapid development and huge impact, laying out interventions becomes one of the most critical paths for policymakers to respond to the epidemic. However, the existing studies mainly focus on epidemic control with a single intervention, which makes the epidemic control effectiveness severely compromised. In view of this, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning decision framework for multi-mode Epidemic Control with multiple interventions called HRL4EC. We devise an epidemiological model, referred to as MID-SEIR, to describe multiple interventions' impact on transmission explicitly, and use it as the environment for HRL4EC.

Existing support measures share the idea of counting the number of instances of a given label set C as its support, where an instance of C is an object set whose objects collectively carry all labels in C and are located close to one another. However, they suffer from various weaknesses, e.g., fail to capture all possible instances, or overlook the cases when multiple instances overlap. In this paper, we propose a new measure called Fraction-Score which counts instances fractionally if they overlap. Fraction-Score captures all possible instances, and handles the cases where instances overlap appropriately (so that the supports defined are more meaningful and anti\u00a0\u2026", "As a representative information retrieval task, site recommendation, which aims at predicting the optimal sites for a brand or an institution to open new branches in an automatic data-driven way, is beneficial and crucial for brand development in modern business. However, there is no publicly available dataset so far and most existing approaches are limited to an extremely small scope of brands, which seriously hinders the research on site recommendation. Therefore, we collect, construct and release an open comprehensive dataset, namely OpenSiteRec, to facilitate and promote the research on site recommendation. Specifically, OpenSiteRec leverages a heterogeneous graph schema to represent various types of real-world entities and relations in four international metropolises. To evaluate the performance of the existing general methods on the site recommendation task, we conduct benchmarking experiments of several representative recommendation models on OpenSiteRec. Furthermore, we also highlight the potential application directions to demonstrate the wide applicability of OpenSiteRec. We believe that our OpenSiteRec dataset is significant and anticipated to encourage the development of advanced methods for site recommendation. OpenSiteRec is available online at https://OpenSiteRec.github.io/.", "Road network is a critical infrastructure powering many applications including transportation, mobility and logistics in real life. To leverage the input of a road network across these different applications, it is necessary to learn the representations of the roads in the form of vectors, which is named road network representation learning (RNRL). While several models have been proposed for RNRL, they capture the pairwise relationships/connections among roads only (i.e., as a simple graph), and fail to capture among roads the high-order relationships (e.g., those roads that jointly form a local region usually have similar features such as speed limit) and long-range relationships (e.g., some roads that are far apart may have similar semantics such as being roads in residential areas). Motivated by this, we propose to construct a hypergraph, where each hyperedge corresponds to a set of multiple roads forming a region\u00a0\u2026", "Asking Clarifying Questions (CQs) in information-seeking systems is becoming more attractive, because of its advantage to discover the users' underlying information needs. In the multi-turn information-seeking sessions, CQs may be of different qualities and can be asked in various orders. Therefore, it is critical to understand and measure how the order of CQs and their quality affect user behavior and satisfaction. In this presentation, we present a user study to investigate to what extent the CQ quality trajectories (i.e., asking CQs of different qualities in chronological order) affect user behavior and satisfaction, on both query and session levels. Our user study is conducted by deploying an online experimental system, in which users are asked to interact with CQs and the system in order to complete a set of Web search tasks. The study highlights that the trajectory of CQs does affect the way users interact with Search\u00a0\u2026", "As the popularity of graph data increases, there is a growing need to count the occurrences of subgraph patterns of interest, for a variety of applications. Many graphs are massive in scale and also fully dynamic (with insertions and deletions of edges), rendering exact computation of these counts to be infeasible. Common practice is, instead, to use a small set of edges as a sample to estimate the counts. Existing sampling algorithms for fully dynamic graphs sample the edges with uniform probability. In this paper, we show that we can do much better if we sample edges based on their individual properties. Specifically, we propose a weighted sampling algorithm called WSD for estimating the subgraph count in a fully dynamic graph stream, which samples the edges based on their weights that indicate their importance and reflect their properties. We determine the weights of edges in a data-driven fashion, using a\u00a0\u2026", "Physiological signal classification is of great significance for health monitoring and medical diagnosis. Deep learning-based methods (eg RNN and CNN) have been used in this domain to obtain reliable predictions. However, the performance of existing methods is constrained by the long-term dependence and irregular vibration of the univariate physiological signal sequence. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-scale Progressive Gated Transformer (MPGT) model to learn multi-scale temporal representations for better physiological signal classification. The key novelties of MPGT are the proposed Multi-scale Temporal Feature extraction (MTF) and Progressive Gated Transformer (PGT). The former adopts coarse-and fine-grained feature extractors to project the input signal data into different temporal granularity embedding spaces and the latter integrates such multi-scale information for data representation. Classification task is then conducted on the learned representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.", "A user-item utility matrix represents the utility (or preference) associated with each (user, item) pair, such as citation counts, rating/vote on items or locations, and clicks on items. A high utility value indicates a strong association of the pair. In this work, we consider the problem of summarizing strong association for a large user-item matrix using a small summary size. Traditional techniques fail to distinguish user groups associated with different items (such as top-l item selection) or fail to focus on high utility (such as similarity- based subspace clustering and biclustering). We formulate a new problem, called Group Utility Maximization (GUM), to summarize the entire user population through k user groups and l items for each group; the goal is to maximize the total utility of selected items over all groups collectively. We show this problem is NP-hard even for l=1. We present two algorithms.

We present theoretical results of the best possible competitive ratio an online algorithm can achieve for the LS-PMU problem. We then develop a reinforcement learning-based algorithm called  RL4LS  to intelligently choose the supplier and decide the order quantity in each time period. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to verify that  RL4LS  outperforms existing algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, e.g.,  RL4LS  improves the effectiveness by 44\u00a0\u2026", "The key to the success of few-shot segmentation (FSS) lies in how to effectively utilize support samples. Most solutions compress support foreground (FG) features into prototypes, but lose some spatial details. Instead, others use cross attention to fuse query features with uncompressed support FG. Query FG is safely fused with support FG, however, query background (BG) cannot find matched BG features in support FG, yet it inevitably integrates dissimilar features. Besides, as both query FG and BG are combined with support FG, they get entangled, thereby leading to ineffective segmentation. To cope with these issues, we design a self-calibrated cross attention (SCCA) block. For efficient patch-based attention, query and support features are firstly split into patches. Then, we design a patch alignment module to align each query patch with its most similar support patch for better cross attention. Specifically, SCCA takes a query patch as Q, and groups the patches from the same query image and the aligned patches from the support image as K&V. In this way, the query BG features are fused with matched BG features (from query patches), and thus the aforementioned issues will be mitigated. Moreover, when calculating SCCA, we design a scaled-cosine mechanism to better utilize the support features for similarity calculation. Extensive experiments conducted on PASCAL-5^ i and COCO-20^ i demonstrate the superiority of our model, eg, the mIoU score under 5-shot setting on COCO-20^ i is 5.6%+ better than previous state-of-the-arts. The code is available at https://github. com/Sam1224/SCCAN.", "When users move in a physical space (e.g., an urban space), they would have some records called mobility records (e.g., trajectories) generated by devices such as mobile phones and GPS devices. Naturally, mobility records capture essential information of how users work, live and entertain in their daily lives, and therefore, they have been used in a wide range of tasks such as user profile inference, mobility prediction and traffic management. In this paper, we expand this line of research by investigating the problem of inferring user socioeconomic statuses (such as prices of users\u2019 living houses as a proxy of users\u2019 socioeconomic statuses) based on their mobility records, which can potentially be used in real-life applications such as the car loan business. For this task, we propose a socioeconomic-aware deep model called DeepSEI.

The collected data facilitates various sports analytic tasks; however, these studies are mainly concerning with sports such as football and basketball. It remains largely unexplored for billiards sports though it is a popular sport of both strategy and physical skill, and this is mainly due to the lack of publicly available datasets. Motivated by this, we collect a dataset of billiards sports, which includes the layouts (i.e., locations) of billiards balls after performing break shots, called break shot layouts, the traces of the balls as a result of strikes (in the form of trajectories), and detailed statistics and performance indicators.

In this paper, we point out some issues in   -Regret Querying, including the assumption of non-negative dataset and the lack of shift invariance. Known algorithms for   -Regret Querying are limited in scope and result quality, and are based on the assumption of non-negative data. We introduce a new problem definition called   -pleased querying for dealing with the shift variance issue, and propose a strategy of random sampling of the utility functions. This strategy is based on a study of the theoretical guarantee of the sampling approach. We also introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy, an improved greedy algorithm, and a study of other utility function sampling methods. All of our solutions can handle negative data. Theoretically, we derive a guarantee on the\u00a0\u2026", "It was well observed that a user\u2019s preference over a product changes based on his/her friends\u2019 preferences, and this phenomenon is called \u201cpreference diffusion\u201d, and several models have been proposed for modeling the preference diffusion process. These models share an idea that the diffusion process involves many iterations, and in each iteration, each user has his/her preference affected by some other preferences (eg, those of his/her friends). When computing users\u2019 preferences after a certain number of iterations, these models use users\u2019 preferences at the end of that iteration only, which we believe is not desirable since users\u2019 preferences at the end of other iterations should also have some effects on users\u2019 final preferences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new model for preference diffusion, which takes into consideration users\u2019 preferences at each iteration for computing users\u2019 final preferences\u00a0\u2026", "Large-scale demographic datasets with spatial information provide a rich platform for human development research. Much emphasis is often placed on understanding deviations from dataset-level behavior across demographic attributes within spatially coherent regions, since those could point to a local condition worth addressing through regional policies, or at the other extreme, a less known success story that offers new learnings. Inspired by such scenarios, we build upon domain knowledge from HDR to devise an interestingness scoring for spatial regions and formulate the computational task of interesting spatial region identification. Accordingly, we develop a taxonomic organization of spatial regions and formulate bounds on interestingness scores, which are then leveraged to develop an efficient technique to address the task. Our search method is empirically evaluated over two real-world datasets\u00a0\u2026"]}, "collaboration_network": {"target": [], "target_id": [], "type": [], "location": [], "year": [], "title": [], "link": []}, "published_by_year": {"Year": ["2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022", "2023", "unknown"], "# of Publications": [1, 0, 5, 7, 2, 0, 4, 6, 7, 17, 23, 18, 20, 1]}, "citations_by_year": {"Year": ["2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022", "2023", "unknown"], "# of Citations": [1, 2, 3, 27, 61, 76, 104, 99, 117, 180, 325, 390, 440, 14]}, "all_time_h_index": 25, "all_time_i10_index": 43, "all_time_i20_index": 29, "h_index_by_year": {"Year": [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023], "h-index": [1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 10, 14, 19, 22, 25]}, "h_index_by_publication_year": {"Publication Year": [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023], "h-index": [1, 0, 5, 5, 1, 0, 3, 3, 5, 9, 10, 6, 2]}, "avg_citations_by_publication_year": {"Publication Year": [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023], "Avg Citations per Publication": [84.0, 0.0, 80.8, 33.57142857142857, 8.5, 0.0, 14.5, 15.833333333333334, 30.571428571428573, 19.11764705882353, 11.608695652173912, 5.666666666666667, 1.2]}, "h_index_by_years_from_publication_year": {"Publication Year": [2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2012, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2022, 2022, 2023], "Year": [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2022, 2023, 2023], "h-index": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 8, 9, 9, 3, 7, 10, 3, 6, 2]}}
