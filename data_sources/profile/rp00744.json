of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growing location based social networks (LBSNs) enables many important location-aware services to users. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services, which is to recommend places where users have not visited before. Several techniques have been recently proposed for the recommendation service. However, no existing work has considered the temporal information for POI recommendations in LBSNs. We believe that time plays an important role in POI recommendations because most users tend to visit different places at different time in a day, \\eg visiting a restaurant at noon and visiting a bar at night. In this paper, we define a new problem, namely, the time-aware POI recommendation, to recommend POIs for a given user at a specified time in a day. To solve the problem, we develop a collaborative recommendation model\u00a0\u2026", "The conventional Internet is acquiring a geo-spatial dimension. Web documents are being geo-tagged, and geo-referenced objects such as points of interest are being associated with descriptive text documents. The resulting fusion of geo-location and documents enables a new kind of top-k query that takes into account both location proximity and text relevancy. To our knowledge, only naive techniques exist that are capable of computing a general web information retrieval query while also taking location into account. This paper proposes a new indexing framework for location-aware top-k text retrieval. The framework leverages the inverted file for text retrieval and the R-tree for spatial proximity querying. Several indexing approaches are explored within the framework. The framework encompasses algorithms that utilize the proposed indexes for computing the top-k query, thus taking into account both text\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless technologies, mobile social network systems are increasingly available. A mobile social network plays an essential role as the spread of information and influence in the form of \"word-of-mouth\". It is a fundamental issue to find a subset of influential individuals in a mobile social network such that targeting them initially (e.g. to adopt a new product) will maximize the spread of the influence (further adoptions of the new product). The problem of finding the most influential nodes is unfortunately NP-hard. It has been shown that a Greedy algorithm with provable approximation guarantees can give good approximation; However, it is computationally expensive, if not prohibitive, to run the greedy algorithm on a large mobile network. In this paper we propose a new algorithm called Community-based Greedy algorithm for mining top-K influential nodes. The proposed\u00a0\u2026", "The rapidly growing of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) provides a vast amount of check-in data, which enables many services, e.g., point-of-interest (POI) recommendation. In this paper, we study the next new POI recommendation problem in which new POIs with respect to users' current location are to be recommended. The challenge lies in the difficulty in precisely learning users' sequential information and personalizing the recommendation model. To this end, we resort to the Metric Embedding method for the recommendation, which avoids drawbacks of the Matrix Factorization technique. We propose a personalized ranking metric embedding method (PRME) to model personalized check-in sequences. We further develop a PRME-G model, which integrates sequential information, individual preference, and geographical influence, to improve the recommendation performance. Experiments on two real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate that our new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art next POI recommendation methods.", "Two central criteria for data quality are consistency and accuracy. Inconsistencies and errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirty database D, one needs automated methods to make it consistent, ie, find a repair D that satisfies the constraints and \u201cminimally\u201d differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that the automatically-generated repair D is accurate, or makes sense, ie, D differs from the \u201ccorrect\u201d data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving both data consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) proposed in [6] to specify the consistency of the data, which are able to capture inconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improve the consistency of the data, we propose two algorithms: one for automatically computing a repair D that satisfies a given set of CFDs, and the other for incrementally finding a repair in response to updates to a clean database. We show that both problems are intractable. Although our algorithms are necessarily heuristic, we experimentally verify that the methods are effective and efficient. Moreover, we develop a statistical method that guarantees that the repairs found by the algorithms are accurate above a predefined rate without incurring excessive user interaction.", "With the increasing deployment and use of GPS-enabled devices, massive amounts of GPS data are becoming available. We propose a general framework for the mining of semantically meaningful, significant locations, e.g., shopping malls and restaurants, from such data. We present techniques capable of extracting semantic locations from GPS data. We capture the relationships between locations and between locations and users with a graph. Significance is then assigned to locations using random walks over the graph that propagates significance among the locations. In doing so, mutual reinforcement between location significance and user authority is exploited for determining significance, as are aspects such as the number of visits to a location, the durations of the visits, and the distances users travel to reach locations. Studies using up to 100 million GPS records from a confined spatio-temporal region\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging, spatial web objects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence, and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining in prominence. However, the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in a group collectively satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatial web objects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that objects are nearest to the query location and have the lowest inter-object distances. Specifically, we study two variants of this problem, both of which are NP-complete. We devise exact solutions as well as approximate solutions with provable approximation bounds to the problems. We present empirical\u00a0\u2026", "Geo-textual indices play an important role in spatial keyword querying. The existing geo-textual indices have not been compared systematically under the same experimental framework. This makes it difficult to determine which indexing technique best supports specific functionality. We provide an all-around survey of 12 state-of-the-art geo-textual indices. We propose a benchmark that enables the comparison of the spatial keyword query performance. We also report on the findings obtained when applying the benchmark to the indices, thus uncovering new insights that may guide index selection as well as further research.", "With the rapid growth of location-based social networks, Point of Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important research problem. However, the scarcity of the check-in data, a type of implicit feedback data, poses a severe challenge for existing POI recommendation methods. Moreover, different types of context information about POIs are available and how to leverage them becomes another challenge. In this paper, we propose a ranking based geographical factorization method, called Rank-GeoFM, for POI recommendation, which addresses the two challenges. In the proposed model, we consider that the check-in frequency characterizes users' visiting preference and learn the factorization by ranking the POIs correctly.

Almost all the existing solutions for SBR model user preference only based on the current session without exploiting the other sessions, which may contain both relevant and irrelevant item-transitions to the current session. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GCE-GNN) to exploit item transitions over all sessions in a more subtle manner for better inferring the user preference of the current session. Specifically, GCE-GNN learns two levels of item embeddings from session graph and global graph, respectively: (i) Session graph, which is to learn the session-level item embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions within the current session; and (ii) Global graph, which is to learn the global-level item embedding\u00a0\u2026", "Online forums contain a huge amount of valuable user generated content. In this paper we address the problem of extracting question-answer pairs from forums. Question-answer pairs extracted from forums can be used to help Question Answering services (e.g. Yahoo!

Experimental results show that our techniques are very promising.", "The growth of bioinformatics has resulted in datasets with new characteristics. These datasets typically contain a large number of columns and a small number of rows. For example, many gene expression datasets may contain 10,000-100,000 columns but only 100-1000 rows.Such datasets pose a great challenge for existing (closed) frequent pattern discovery algorithms, since they have an exponential dependence on the average row length. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called CARPENTER that is specially designed to handle datasets having a large number of attributes and relatively small number of rows. Several experiments on real bioinformatics datasets show that CARPENTER is orders of magnitude better than previous closed pattern mining algorithms like CLOSET and CHARM.", "Because of Twitter's popularity and the viral nature of information dissemination on Twitter, predicting which Twitter topics will become popular in the near future becomes a task of considerable economic importance. Many Twitter topics are annotated by hashtags. In this article, we propose methods to predict the popularity of new hashtags on Twitter by formulating the problem as a classification task. We use five standard classification models (i.e., Na\u00efve bayes, k\u2010nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression) for prediction. The main challenge is the identification of effective features for describing new hashtags. We extract 7 content features from a hashtag string and the collection of tweets containing the hashtag and 11 contextual features from the social graph formed by users who have adopted the hashtag.

Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services, which is to recommend POIs that users have not visited before. It has been observed that: (i) users tend to visit nearby places, and (ii) users tend to visit different places in different time slots, and in the same time slot, users tend to periodically visit the same places. For example, users usually visit a restaurant during lunch hours, and visit a pub at night. In this paper, we focus on the problem of time-aware POI recommendation, which aims at recommending a list of POIs for a user to visit at a given time. To exploit both geographical and temporal influences in time aware POI recommendation, we propose the Geographical-Temporal influences Aware Graph (GTAG) to model check-in\u00a0\u2026", "Micro-blogging services, such as Twitter, and location-based social network applications have generated short text messages associated with geographic information, posting time, and user ids.

To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first solution to jointly model individual user's mobility behavior from the three aspects.

In this paper, we provide an all-around evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art POI recommendation models. From the evaluation, we obtain several important findings, based on which we can better understand and utilize POI recommendation models in various scenarios. We anticipate this work to provide readers with an overall picture of the cutting-edge research on POI recommendation.", "The problem of influence maximization, ie, mining top-k influential nodes from a social network such that the spread of influence in the network is maximized, is NP-hard. Most of the existing algorithms for the prob-lem are based on greedy algorithm. Although greedy algorithm can achieve a good approximation, it is computational expensive. In this paper, we propose a totally different approach based on Simulated Annealing (SA) for the influence maximization problem. This is the first SA based algorithm for the problem. Additionally, we propose two heuristic methods to accelerate the con-vergence process of SA, and a new method of comput-ing influence to speed up the proposed algorithm.

This query occurs inherently in many types of mobile and traditional web services and applications, e.g., Yellow Pages and Maps services. Previous work considers the potential results of such a query as being independent when ranking them. However, a relevant result object with nearby objects that are also relevant to the query is likely to be preferable over a relevant object without relevant nearby objects. The paper proposes the concept of prestige-based relevance to capture both the textual relevance of an object to a query and the effects of nearby objects. Based on this, a new type of query, the Location-aware top-k Prestige-based Text retrieval (LkPT) query, is proposed that retrieves the top-k spatial web objects ranked according to both prestige-based\u00a0\u2026", "With the increasing popularity of location-aware social media applications, Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has recently been extensively studied. However, most of the existing studies explore from the users' perspective, namely recommending POIs for users. In contrast, we consider a new research problem of predicting users who will visit a given POI in a given future period. The challenge of the problem lies in the difficulty to effectively learn POI sequential transition and user preference, and integrate them for prediction. In this work, we propose a new latent representation model POI2Vec that is able to incorporate the geographical influence, which has been shown to be very important in modeling user mobility behavior. Note that existing representation models fail to incorporate the geographical influence. We further propose a method to jointly model the user preference and POI sequential transition influence for predicting potential visitors for a given POI. We conduct experiments on 2 real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art algorithms for both next POI prediction and future user prediction.", "Geographic objects associated with descriptive texts are becoming prevalent. This gives prominence to spatial keyword queries that take into account both the locations and textual descriptions of content. Specifically, the relevance of an object to a query is measured by spatial-textual similarity that is based on both spatial proximity and textual similarity. In this paper, we define Reverse Spatial Textual k Nearest Neighbor (RSTkNN) query, i.e., finding objects that take the query object as one of their k most spatial-textual similar objects. Existing works on reverse kNN queries focus solely on spatial locations but ignore text relevance. To answer RSTkNN queries efficiently, we propose a hybrid index tree called IUR-tree (Intersection-Union R-Tree) that effectively combines location proximity with textual similarity.

This motivates the studies on group recommendation, which aims to recommend items for a group of users. Group recommendation is a challenging problem because different group members have different preferences, and how to make a trade-off among their preferences for recommendation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model named COM (COnsensus Model) to model the generative process of group activities, and make group recommendations. Intuitively, users in a group may have different influences, and those who are expert in topics relevant to the group are usually more influential. In addition, users in a group may behave differently as group members from as individuals. COM\u00a0\u2026", "Influence maximization is a fundamental research problem in social networks.

In this paper, we propose the time constrained influence maximization problem. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and prove the monotonicity and submodularity of the time constrained influence spread function.

This is particularly a problem when the point sequences are non-uniform, have low sampling rates, and have noisy points. We propose the first deep learning approach to learning representations of trajectories that is robust to low data quality, thus supporting accurate and efficient trajectory similarity computation and search.

State-of-the-art solutions for moving queries employ safe zones that guarantee the validity of reported results as long as the user remains within a zone. However, existing safe zone methods focus solely on spatial locations and ignore text relevancy. We propose two algorithms for computing safe zones that guarantee correct results at any time and that aim to optimize the computation on the server as well as the communication between the server and the client. We exploit tight and conservative approximations of safe zones and aggressive computational space pruning. Empirical studies with real data suggest that our proposals are efficient.", "The web is increasingly being used by mobile users. In addition, it is increasingly becoming possible to accurately geo-position mobile users and web content. This development gives prominence to spatial web data management.

Association rules have been proved to be useful in analyzing such datasets. However, most existing association rule mining algorithms are unable to efficiently handle datasets with large number of columns. Moreover, the number of association rules generated from such datasets is enormous due to the large number of possible column combinations.In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called FARMER that is specially designed to discover association rules from microarray datasets. Instead of finding individual association rules, FARMER finds interesting rule groups which are essentially a set of rules that are generated from the same set of rows. Unlike conventional rule mining algorithms, FARMER searches for interesting rules in the row enumeration space and exploits all user-specified constraints including minimum\u00a0\u2026", "Subspace clustering finds sets of objects that are homogeneous in subspaces of high-dimensional datasets, and has been successfully applied in many domains.

In this survey, we present these enhanced approaches to subspace clustering by discussing the problems they are solving, their cluster definitions and algorithms. Besides enhanced subspace clustering, we also present the basic subspace clustering and the related works in high-dimensional clustering.", "Accurate traffic forecasting is critical in improving safety, stability, and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Despite years of studies, accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges, including modeling the dynamics of traffic data along both temporal and spatial dimensions, and capturing the periodicity and the spatial heterogeneity of traffic data, and the problem is more difficult for long-term forecast. In this paper, we propose an Attention based Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ASTGNN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, in the temporal dimension, we design a novel self-attention mechanism that is capable of utilizing the local context, which is specialized for numerical sequence representation transformation. It enables our prediction model to capture the temporal dynamics of traffic data and to enjoy global receptive fields that is beneficial for long-term forecast.

The state-of-the-art solutions for the problem can be divided into two categories: spatial-coherence-based methods and vertex-importance-based approaches. The two categories of techniques, however, have not been compared systematically under the same experimental framework, as they were developed from two independent lines of research that do not refer to each other. This renders it difficult for a practitioner to decide which technique should be adopted for a specific application. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation of the existing techniques, as presented in previous work, falls short in several aspects. Some methods were tested only on small road networks with up to one hundred thousand vertices; some approaches were evaluated using distance queries (instead of shortest path queries), namely, queries that ask only for the length of the shortest path; a state-of-the-art technique was examined based on a faulty implementation that led to incorrect query results. To address the above issues, this paper presents a comprehensive comparison of the most advanced spatial-coherence-based and vertex-importance-based approaches.

RCBT classifier is constructed from the top-k covering rule groups. The rule groups generated for building RCBT are bounded in number. This is in contrast to existing rule-based classification methods like CBA [19] which despite generating excessive number of redundant rules, is still unable to cover some training data with the discovered rules. Experiments show that the RCBT classifier can match or outperform other state-of-the-art classifiers on several benchmark gene expression datasets.

Several indexing approaches are explored within this framework.

The problem of answering KOR queries is NP-hard. We devise an approximation algorithm OSScaling with provable approximation bounds. Based on this algorithm, another more efficient approximation algorithm BucketBound is proposed. We also design a greedy approximation algorithm.

Furthermore, NeuTraj is elastic to collaborate with all spatial-based trajectory indexing methods to reduce the search space. NeuTraj samples a number of seed trajectories from the given database, and then uses their pair-wise similarities as guidance to approximate the similarity function with a neural metric\u00a0\u2026", "Readers of a news article often read its comments contributed by other readers. By reading comments, readers obtain not only complementary information about this news article but also the opinions from other readers. However, the existing ranking mechanisms for comments (e.g., by recency or by user rating) fail to offer an overall picture of topics discussed in comments. In this paper, we first propose to study Topic-driven Reader Comments Summarization (Torcs) problem. We observe that many news articles from a news stream are related to each other; so are their comments. Hence, news articles and their associated comments provide context information for user commenting. To implicitly capture the context information, we propose two topic models to address the Torcs problem, namely, Master-Slave Topic Model (MSTM) and Extended Master-Slave Topic Model (EXTM). Both models treat a news article as a\u00a0\u2026", "A basic idea in parallel query processing is that one is prepared to do more computation than strictly necessary at individual sites in order to reduce the elapsed time, the network traffic, or both in the evaluation of the query. We develop this idea for the evaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented, both horizontally and vertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site which partially evaluates, in parallel, the query and sends the results as compact boolean functions to a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has several advantages. First, each site is visited only once, even if several fragments of the tree are stored at that site. Second, no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed, nor is any structural information about the tree required, such as a dtd. Third, there is a satisfactory bound on the total computation performed on all sites and on the total network traffic. We also develop a simple incremental maintenance algorithm that requires communication only with the sites at which changes have taken place; moreover the network traffic depends neither on the data nor on the update. These results, we believe, illustrate the usefulness and potential of partial evaluation in distributed systems as well as centralized xml stores for evaluating XPath queries and beyond.", "This paper proposes Medley of Sub-Attention Networks (MoSAN), a new novel neural architecture for the group recommendation task. Group-level recommendation is known to be a challenging task, in which intricate group dynamics have to be considered. As such, this is to be contrasted with the standard recommendation problem where recommendations are personalized with respect to a single user. Our proposed approach hinges upon the key intuition that the decision making process (in groups) is generally dynamic, i.e., a user's decision is highly dependent on the other group members. All in all, our key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures fine-grained interactions between group members. In our MoSAN model, each sub-attention module is representative of a single member, which models a user's preference with respect to all other group members. Subsequently, a\u00a0\u2026", "Many location based services, such as FourSquare, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google Places, etc., allow users to compose reviews or tips on points of interest (POIs), each having a geographical coordinates. These services have accumulated a large amount of such geo-tagged review data, which allows deep analysis of user preferences in POIs. This paper studies two types of user preferences to POIs: topical-region preference and category aware topical-aspect preference. We propose a unified probabilistic model to capture these two preferences simultaneously. In addition, our model is capable of capturing the interaction of different factors, including topical aspect, sentiment, and spatial information. The model can be used in a number of applications, such as POI recommendation and user recommendation, among others. In addition, the model enables us to investigate whether people like an aspect of a POI or\u00a0\u2026", "The adoption of hashtags in major social networks including Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ is a strong evidence of its importance in facilitating information diffusion and social chatting. To understand the factors (e.g., user interest, posting time and tweet content) that may affect hashtag annotation in Twitter and to capture the implicit relations between latent topics in tweets and their corresponding hashtags, we propose two PLSA-style topic models to model the hashtag annotation behavior in Twitter. Content-Pivoted Model (CPM) assumes that tweet content guides the generation of hashtags while Hashtag-Pivoted Model (HPM) assumes that hashtags guide the generation of tweet content. Both models jointly incorporate user, time, hashtag and tweet content in a probabilistic framework. The PLSA-style models also enable us to verify the impact of social factor on hashtag annotation by introducing social network\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging techniques, spatio-textual objects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence, and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining in prominence. However, the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in a group together satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatio-textual objects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that the objects are nearest to the query location and have the smallest inter-object distances. Specifically, we study three instantiations of this problem, all of which are NP-hard. We devise exact solutions as well as approximate solutions with provable approximation bounds to the problems.

In this paper, we take the first systematic step to discover influential event organizers from online social networks who are essential to the overall success of social events. Informally, such event organizers comprise a small group of people who not only have the relevant skills or expertise that are required for an event (e.g. conference) but they are also able to influence largest number of people to actively contribute to it. We formulate it as the problem of mining influential cover set (ICS) where we wish to find k users in a social network G that together have the required skills or expertise (modeled as attributes of nodes in G) to organize an event such that they can influence the greatest number of individuals to participate in the event.

Existing algorithms can presently be separated into two groups, feature (column) enumeration and row enumeration. Feature enumeration algorithms like CHARM and CLOSET+ are efficient for datasets with small number of features and large number of rows since the number of feature combinations to be enumerated is small. Row enumeration algorithms like CARPENTER on the other hand are more suitable for datasets (eg. bioinformatics data) with large number of features and small number of rows. Both groups of algorithms, however, will encounter problem for datasets that have large number of rows and features. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called COBBLER which can efficiently mine such datasets .

They arise in a great variety of domains, for example, event-based social networks Meetup and Plancast, and DBLP. Recommendation is a useful task in these heterogeneous network systems. Although many recommendation algorithms are proposed for heterogeneous data, none of them is able to explicitly model the influence strength between different types of entities, which is useful not only for achieving higher recommendation accuracy but also better understanding the role of each entity type in recommendation problems. Moreover, many of those algorithms are designed for a particular task, and hence it is challenging to apply them in other problems.

What left open is whether or not the technique is applicable to generic data-selecting XPath queries. In contrast to Boolean queries that return a single truth value, a generic XPath query returns a set of elements, and its evaluation introduces difficulties to avoiding excessive data shipping. This paper settles this question in positive by providing evaluation algorithms and optimizations for generic XPath queries in the same distributed and fragmented setting. These algorithms explore parallelism and retain the performance guarantees of their counterpart for Boolean queries, regardless of how the tree is fragmented and distributed. First, each site is visited at most three times, and down to at most twice when optimizations are in place.

However, most of the existing studies 1) cannot handle the complexity and variety of trajectory data and 2) do not support efficient anomaly detection in an online manner. To this end, we propose a novel model, namely Gaussian Mixture Variational Sequence AutoEncoder (GM-VSAE), to tackle these challenges. Our GM-VSAE model is able to (1) capture complex sequential information enclosed in trajectories, (2) discover different types of normal routes from trajectories and represent them in a continuous latent space, and (3) support efficient online detection via trajectory generation. Our experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GM-VSAE is more effective than the state-of-the-art baselines and is efficient for online anomalous trajectory detection.", "We study the problem of question topic classification using a very large real\u2010world Community Question Answering (CQA) dataset from Yahoo!

Most of the existing methods are proposed to estimate the propagation probability for each edge in social networks. However, they cannot effectively learn propagation parameters of all edges due to data sparsity, especially for the edges without sufficient observed propagation. Different from the conventional methods, we introduce a novel social influence embedding problem, which is to learn parameters for nodes rather than edges. Nodes are represented as vectors in a low-dimensional space, and thus social influence information can be reflected by these vectors. We develop a new model Inf2vec, which combines both the local influence neighborhood and global user similarity to learn the representations.

We propose a novel probabilistic supervised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM) to deal with the problems in one go under a unified framework. SJASM represents each review document in the form of opinion pairs, and can simultaneously model aspect terms and corresponding opinion words of the review for hidden aspect and sentiment detection. It also leverages sentimental overall ratings, which often come with online reviews, as supervision data, and can infer the semantic aspects and aspect-level sentiments that are not only meaningful but also predictive of overall sentiments of reviews. Moreover, we also develop efficient inference method for parameter estimation of SJASM based on\u00a0\u2026", "Feature-based opinion analysis has attracted extensive attention recently. Identifying features associated with opinions expressed in reviews is essential for fine-grained opinion mining. One approach is to exploit the dependency relations that occur naturally between features and opinion words, and among features (or opinion words) themselves. In this paper, we propose a generalized approach to opinion feature extraction by incorporating robust statistical association analysis in a bootstrapping framework. The new approach starts with a small set of feature seeds, on which it iteratively enlarges by mining feature-opinion, feature-feature, and opinion-opinion dependency relations. Two association model types, namely likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and latent semantic analysis (LSA), are proposed for computing the pair-wise associations between terms (features or opinions).

In the exact solution, we devise an expansion-based framework that enumerates trajectory combinations in a best-first manner and propose three types of upper bound estimation techniques to facilitate early termination. In addition, we propose a novel trajectory index to reduce the influence calculation cost.

Based on the norm that similar users are likely to have similar preference of POIs, the current recommendation techniques mainly focus on users' preference to provide accurate recommendation results. This tends to generate a list of homogeneous POIs that are clustered into a narrow band of location categories (like food, museum, etc.) in a city. However, users are more interested to taste a wide range of flavors that are exposed in a global set of location categories in the city. In this paper, we formulate a new POI recommendation problem, namely top-K location category based POI recommendation, by introducing information coverage to encode the location categories of POIs in a city. The problem is NP-hard. We develop a greedy algorithm and further optimization to solve this challenging problem. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of new POI recommendations and the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.", "We consider an application scenario where points of interest (PoIs) each have a web presence and where a web user wants to identify a region that contains relevant PoIs that are relevant to a set of keywords, e.g., in preparation for deciding where to go to conveniently explore the PoIs.

Such a query maximizes the total weight of the PoIs in it w.r.t. the query keywords. We show that it is NP-hard to answer this query.

DeepGTT interprets the generation of travel time using a three-layer hierarchical probabilistic model. In the first layer, we present two techniques, amortization and spatial smoothness embeddings, to share statistical strength among different road segments; a convolutional neural net based representation learning component is also proposed to capture the dynamically changing real-time traffic condition.

Different from existing solutions which perform location recognition and linking as two sub-tasks sequentially in a pipeline setting, in this paper, we propose a novel joint framework to perform location recognition and location linking simultaneously in a joint search space.

Past research has proposed many efficient algorithms for this purpose. Recent work also highlighted the importance of using constraints to focus the mining process to mine only those relevant itemsets.

This interactive process is very time consuming. Existing mining algorithms are unable to take advantage of this iterative process to use previous mining results to speed up the current mining process.

Given annotations entered for a tuple or an attribute in a view, these problems ask what tuples or attributes in the source have to be annotated to produce the view annotations. As observed in [1], these problems are fundamental not only for data provenance but also for the management of view updates. For an annotation attached to a single existing tuple in a view, it has been shown that these problems are often intractable even for views defined in terms of simple SPJU queries [1]. We revisit these problems by considering several dichotomies: (1) views defined in various subclasses of SPJU, versus SPJU views under a practical key preserving condition; (2) annotations attached to existing tuples in a view versus annotations on tuples to be inserted\u00a0\u2026", "Cardinality estimation is a fundamental problem in database systems. To capture the rich joint data distributions of a relational table, most of the existing work either uses data as unsupervised information or uses query workload as supervised information. Very little work has been done to use both types of information, and cannot fully make use of both types of information to learn the joint data distribution. In this work, we aim to close the gap between data-driven and query-driven methods by proposing a new unified deep autoregressive model, UAE, that learns the joint data distribution from both the data and query workload. First, to enable using the supervised query information in the deep autoregressive model, we develop differentiable progressive sampling using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Second, UAE is able to utilize both types of information to learn the joint data distribution in a single model.

A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords, a specified budget constraint is satisfied, and an objective score of the route is optimized.

The user may issue the following KOR query: \u201cfind the most popular route such that it passes by shopping mall, restaurant, and pub, and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4 hours.\u201d KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers and provides a client application for mobile devices as well.

The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy\u00a0\u2026", "Author name ambiguity has been a long-standing problem which impairs the accuracy of publication retrieval and bibliometric methods. Most of the existing disambiguation methods are built on similarity measures, e.g., \u201cJaccard Coefficient\u201d, between two sets of papers to be disambiguated, each set represented by a set of categorical features, e.g., coauthors and published venues. Such measures perform bad when the two sets are small, which is typical in Author Name Disambiguation. In this paper, we propose a novel categorical set similarity measure. We model an author\u2019s preference, e.g., to venues, using a categorical distribution, and derive a likelihood ratio to estimate the likelihood that the two sets are drawn from the same distribution. This likelihood ratio is used as the similarity measure to decide whether two sets belong to the same author.

Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific fully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing foundation models still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing a FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodality nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of commercial tracking systems, sports data is being generated at an unprecedented speed and the interest in sports play retrieval has grown dramatically as well. However, it is challenging to design an effective, efficient and robust similarity measure for sports play retrieval. To this end, we propose a deep learning approach to learn the representations of sports plays, called play2vec, which is robust against noise and takes only linear time to compute the similarity between two sports plays. We conduct experiments on real-world soccer match data, and the results show that our solution performs more effectively and efficiently compared with the state-of-the-art methods.", "Massive amount of data that are geo-tagged and associated with text information are being generated at an unprecedented scale. These geo-textual data cover a wide range of topics. Users are interested in receiving up-to-date geo-textual objects (e.g., geo-tagged Tweets) such that their locations meet users' need and their texts are interesting to users. For example, a user may want to be updated with tweets near her home on the topic \"dengue fever headache\". AB@In this demonstration, we present SOPS, the Spatial-Keyword Publish/Subscribe System, that is capable of efficiently processing spatial keyword continuous queries. SOPS supports two types of queries: (1) Boolean Range Continuous (BRC) query that can be used to subscribe the geo-textual objects satisfying a boolean keyword expression and falling in a specified spatial region; (2) Temporal Spatial-Keyword Top-k Continuous (TaSK) query that\u00a0\u2026", "Instagram, an online photo-sharing platform, has gained increasing popularity. It allows users to take photos, apply digital filters and share them with friends instantaneously by using mobile devices.Instagram provides users with the functionality to associate their photos with points of interest, and it thus becomes feasible to study the association between points of interest and Instagram photos. However, no previous work studies the association. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of mapping Instagram photos to points of interest. To understand the problem, we analyze Instagram datasets, and report our findings, which also characterize the challenges of the problem. To address the challenges, we propose to model the mapping problem as a ranking problem, and develop a method to learn a ranking function by exploiting the textual, visual and user information of photos.

These systems allow users to associate geolocation information with their images, which is essential for many interesting applications. However, only a small fraction of social images have geolocation information. Thus, an automated tool for suggesting geolocation is essential to help users geotag their images. In this article, we use a large data set consisting of 221 million Flickr images uploaded by 2.2 million users. For the first time, we analyze user uploading patterns, user geotagging behaviors, and the relationship between the taken\u2010time gap and the geographical distance between two images from the same user. Based on the findings, we represent a user profile by historical tags for the user and build a multinomial model on the user profile for geotagging.

In the last decade, an increasing number of advanced CardEst methods (especially ML-based) have been proposed with outstanding estimation accuracy and inference latency. However, there exists no study that systematically evaluates the quality of these methods and answer the fundamental problem: to what extent can these methods improve the performance of query optimizer in real-world settings, which is the ultimate goal of a CardEst method. In this paper, we comprehensively and systematically compare the effectiveness of CardEst methods in a real DBMS. We establish a new benchmark for CardEst, which contains a new complex real-world dataset STATS and a diverse query workload STATS-CEB. We integrate multiple most representative CardEst methods into an open-source database system PostgreSQL, and comprehensively evaluate their true effectiveness in improving query plan quality, and other important aspects affecting their applicability, ranging from inference latency, model size, and training time, to update efficiency and accuracy. We obtain a number of key findings for the CardEst methods, under different data and query settings. Furthermore, we find that the widely used estimation accuracy metric(Q-Error) cannot distinguish the importance of different sub-plan queries during query optimization and thus cannot truly reflect the query plan quality generated by CardEst methods. Therefore, we propose a new metric P-Error to evaluate the performance of CardEst methods, which overcomes the\u00a0\u2026", "An increasing amount of trajectory data is being annotated with text descriptions to better capture the semantics associated with locations. The fusion of spatial locations and text descriptions in trajectories engenders a new type of top- queries that take into account both aspects. Each trajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatial locations associated with text descriptions. Given a user location  and a keyword set , a top- query returns  trajectories whose text descriptions cover the keywords  and that have the shortest match distance. To the best of our knowledge, previous research on querying trajectory databases has focused on trajectory data without any text description, and no existing work has studied such kind of top- queries on trajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing top- trajectories. The method is developed based on a new hybrid index, cell-keyword conscious B-tree, denoted by \\cellbtree, which enables us to exploit both text relevance and location proximity to facilitate efficient and effective query processing. The results of our extensive empirical studies with an implementation of the proposed algorithms on BerkeleyDB demonstrate that our proposed methods are capable of achieving excellent performance and good scalability.", "As one of the most well known graph computation problems, Personalized PageRank is an effective approach for computing the similarity score between two nodes, and it has been widely used in various applications, such as link prediction and recommendation. Due to the high computational cost and space cost of computing the exact Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV), most existing studies compute PPV approximately. In this paper, we propose novel and efficient distributed algorithms that compute PPV exactly based on graph partitioning on a general coordinator-based share-nothing distributed computing platform. Our algorithms takes three aspects into account: the load balance, the communication cost, and the computation cost of each machine. The proposed algorithms only require one time of communication between each machine and the coordinator at query time. The communication cost is bounded\u00a0\u2026", "Studying the spread of phenomena in social networks is critical but still not fully solved. Existing influence maximization models assume a static network, disregarding its evolution over time. We introduce the continuous time constrained influence maximization problem for dynamic diffusion networks, based on a novel diffusion model called DynaDiffuse. Although the problem is NP-hard, the influence spread functions are monotonic and submodular, enabling fast approximations on top of an innovative stochastic model checking approach. Experiments on real social network data show that our model finds higher quality solutions and our algorithm outperforms state-of-art alternatives.", "Text classification using a small labeled set and a large unlabeled data is seen as a promising technique to reduce the labor-intensive and time consuming effort of labeling training data in order to build accurate classifiers since unlabeled data is easy to get from the Web. In [16] it has been demonstrated that an unlabeled set improves classification accuracy significantly with only a small labeled training set. However, the Bayesian method used in [16] assumes that text documents are generated from a mixture model and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the mixture components and the classes. This may not be the case in many applications. In many real-life applications, a class may cover documents from many different topics, which violates the one-to-one correspondence assumption. In such cases, the resulting classifiers can be quite poor.

For example, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences reports that the problem of haze and fog in China is hitting a record level, and China is currently suffering from the worst air pollution. Among the various causal factors of air quality, particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (i.e., PM2.5) is a very important factor; governments and people are increasingly concerned with the concentration of PM2.5. In many cities, stations for monitoring PM2.5 concentration have been built by governments or companies to monitor urban air quality. Apart from monitoring, there is a rising demand for finding pollution sources of PM2.5 and discovering the transmission of PM2.5 based on the data from PM monitoring stations.

Viral marketing, one of its applications, aims to select a small set of users to adopt a product, so that the word-of-mouth effect can subsequently trigger a large cascade of further adoption in social networks. The problem of influence maximization is to select a set of K nodes from a social network so that the spread of influence is maximized over the network. Previous research on mining top-K influential nodes assumes that all of the selected K nodes can propagate the influence as expected. However, some of the selected nodes may not function well in practice, which leads to influence loss of top-K nodes. In this paper, we study an alternative influence maximization problem which is naturally motivated by the reliability constraint of nodes in social networks. We aim to find top-K influential nodes given a threshold of influence loss due to the\u00a0\u2026", "Similarity calculation has many applications, such as information retrieval, and collaborative filtering, among many others. It has been shown that link-based similarity measure, such as SimRank, is very effective in characterizing the object similarities in networks, such as the Web, by exploiting the object-to-object relationship. Unfortunately, it is prohibitively expensive to compute the link-based similarity in a relatively large graph. In this paper, based on the observation that link-based similarity scores of real world graphs follow the power-law distribution, we propose a new approximate algorithm, namely Power-SimRank, with guaranteed error bound to efficiently compute link-based similarity measure. We also prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on real world datasets and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms SimRank by four-five times in\u00a0\u2026", "Data cube pre-computation is an important concept for supporting OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) and has been studied extensively. It is often not feasible to compute a complete data cube due to the huge storage requirement. Recently proposed quotient cube addressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalence partitions. Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such as SUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN.Maintaining a data cube for holistic aggregation is a hard problem since its difficulty lies in the fact that history tuple values must be kept in order to compute the new aggregate when tuples are inserted or deleted. The quotient cube makes the problem harder since we also need to maintain the equivalence classes.

Over the past decade, substantial research has been conducted on integrating location into keyword-based querying of geo-textual content in settings where the underlying data is assumed to be either relatively static or is assumed to stream into a system that maintains a set of continuous queries. This paper offers a survey of both the research problems studied and the solutions proposed in these two settings.

However, the huge number of regions with complicated spatial information are expensive for people to explore and understand. To solve this issue, we study the problem of searching similar regions given a user specified query region. The problem is challenging in both similarity definition and search efficiency. To tackle the two challenges, we propose a novel solution equipped by (1) a deep learning approach to learning the similarity that considers both object attributes and the relative locations between objects; and (2) an efficient branch and bound search algorithm for finding top-N similar regions. Moreover, we propose an approximation method to further improve the efficiency by slightly sacrificing\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of geo-positioning techniques that enable users to acquire their geographical positions, there has been increasing popularity of online location-based services.

It gives prominence to various types of spatial-keyword queries, which are employed to provide fundamental querying functionality for location-based services. We study the Location-aware Group Preference (LGP) query that aims to find a destination place for a group of users. The group of users want to go to a place labeled with a specified category feature (e.g., hotel) together, and each of them has a location and a set of additional preferences.

In this paper, we explore domain-specific term weight for archived question search. Specifically, we propose a novel light-weighted term weighting scheme that exploits multiple aspects of the domain information. We also introduce a framework to seamlessly integrate domain-specific term weight into the existing retrieval models. Extensive experiments conducted on real Archived QA data demonstrate the utility of the proposed techniques.", "Estimating the result sizes of XML queries is important in query optimization and is useful in providing a quick feedback about the queries. Existing works have focused on the selectivity estimation of XML queries without order-based axes. In this work, we develop a framework to estimate the result sizes of XPath expressions with order-based axes. We describe how the path and order information of XML elements can be captured and summarized in compact data structures. We also describe methods to estimate the selectivity of XPath queries. The results of extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.", "Searching for a community based on query nodes in a graph is a fundamental problem and has been extensively investigated. Most of the existing approaches focus on finding a community in a social network, and very few studies consider location-based social networks where users can check in locations. In this paper we propose the GeoSocial Community Search problem (GCS) which aims to find a social community and a cluster of spatial locations that are densely connected in a location-based social network simultaneously. The GCS can be useful for marketing and user/location recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to find a social community and a cluster of spatial locations that are densely connected from location-based social networks. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and is not in APX, unless P = NP. To solve this problem, we propose three algorithms: core-based basic\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we study the spatial pattern matching (SPM) query. Given a set D of spatial objects (e.g., houses and shops), each with a textual description, we aim at finding all combinations of objects from D that match a user-defined spatial pattern P. A pattern P is a graph where vertices represent spatial objects, and edges denote distance relationships between them. The SPM query returns the instances that satisfy P. An example of P can be \"a house within 10-minute walk from a school, which is at least 2km away from a hospital\". The SPM query can benefit users such as house buyers, urban planners, and archaeologists. We prove that answering such queries is computationally intractable, and propose two efficient algorithms for their evaluation. Extensive experimental evaluation and cases studies on four real datasets show that our proposed solutions are highly effective and efficient.", "This paper investigates the view update problem for XML views published from relational data. We consider (possibly) recursively defined XML views, compressed into DAGs and stored in relations. We provide new techniques to efficiently support XML view updates specified in terms of XFath expressions with recursion and complex filters. The interaction between XFath recursion and DAG compression of XML views makes the analysis of XML view updates intriguing. Furthermore, many issues are still open even for relational view updates, and need to be explored. In response to these, we revise the update semantics to accommodate XML side effects based on the semantics of XML views, and present efficient algorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates.

In these models, matching functions such as the Euclidean distance or inner product are typically used for computing similarity scores between user and item embeddings. This paper investigates the notion of learning user and item representations in Hyperbolic space. In this paper, we argue that Hyperbolic space is more suitable for learning user-item embeddings in the recommendation domain. Unlike Euclidean spaces, Hyperbolic spaces are intrinsically equipped to handle hierarchical structure, encouraged by its property of exponentially increasing distances away from origin. We propose HyperBPR (Hyperbolic Bayesian Personalized Ranking), a conceptually simple but highly effective model for the task at hand. Our proposed HyperBPR not only outperforms their Euclidean counterparts, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of personalized recommendation in Hyperbolic space.", "Similar trajectory search is a fundamental problem and has been well studied over the past two decades. However, the similar subtrajectory search (SimSub) problem, aiming to return a portion of a trajectory (i.e., a subtrajectory) which is the most similar to a query trajectory, has been mostly disregarded despite that it could capture trajectory similarity in a finer-grained way and many applications take subtrajectories as basic units for analysis. In this paper, we study the SimSub problem and develop a suite of algorithms including both exact and approximate ones. Among those approximate algorithms, two that are based on deep reinforcement learning stand out and outperform those non-learning based algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We conduct experiments on real-world trajectory datasets, which verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "Stack Overflow and MedHelp are examples of domain-specific community-based question answering (CQA) systems. Different from CQA systems for general topics (eg, Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Knows), questions and answers in domain-specific CQA systems are mostly in the same topical domain, enabling more comprehensive interaction between users on fine-grained topics. In such systems, users are more likely to ask questions on unfamiliar topics and to answer questions matching their expertise. Users can also vote answers based on their judgements. In this paper, we propose a Tri-Role Topic Model (TRTM) to model the tri-roles of users (ie, as askers, answerers, and voters, respectively) and the activities of each role including composing question, selecting question to answer, contributing and voting answers. The proposed model can be used to enhance CQA systems from many perspectives. As a case study, we conducted experiments on ranking answers for questions on Stack Overflow, a CQA system for professional and enthusiast programmers. Experimental results show that TRTM is effective in facilitating users getting ideal rankings of answers, particularly for new and less popular questions. Evaluated on nDCG, TRTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "Online reviews are immensely valuable for customers to make informed purchase decisions and for businesses to improve the quality of their products and services. However, customer reviews grow exponentially while varying greatly in quality. It is generally very tedious and difficult, if not impossible, for users to read though the huge amount of review data. Fortunately, review quality evaluation enables a system to select the most helpful reviews for users' decision-making. Previous studies predict only the overall review utility about a product, and often focus on developing different data features to learn a quality function for addressing the problem.

The bulk of the research on influence maximization assumes that the influence diffusion probabilities across edges are fixed, and the top- k seed users are identified to maximize the cascade in the entire graph. However, in real-world applications, edge probabilities typically depend on the information being cascaded, e.g., in social influence networks, the probability that a tweet of some user will be re-tweeted by her followers depends on whether the tweet contains specific hashtags.

DeepST explains the generation of next route by conditioning on the representations of the three explanatory factors. To enable effectively sharing the statistical strength, we propose to learn representations of K-destination proxies with an adjoint generative model. To incorporate the impact of real-time traffic, we introduce a high dimensional latent variable as its representation whose posterior distribution can then be inferred from observations.

Tweets contain dynamic and real-time information while POIs contain relatively static information. The tweets associated with POIs provide complementary information for many applications like opinion mining and POI recommendation; the associated POIs can also be used as POI tags in Twitter.

Given a group of keywords X and a distance r, an SGKS returns locations on a road network, such that for each returned location p, there exists a set of nodes (on the road network), which are located within a network distance r from p and collectively contains X.

In this paper we propose a novel video classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text features for video classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content features at classification time.

We first mine labeled tree patterns and sequential patterns to characterize both erroneous and correct sentences. Then the discovered patterns are utilized in two ways to distinguish correct sentences from erroneous sentences:(1) the patterns are transformed into sentence features for existing classification models, eg, SVM;(2) the patterns are used to build a rulebased classification model. Experimental results show that both techniques are promising while the second technique outperforms the first approach. Moreover, the classification model in the second proposal is easy to understand, and we can provide intuitive explanation for classification results.", "This paper investigates a class of transform queries proposed by XQuery Update [6]. A transform query is defined in terms of XML update syntax. When posed on an XML tree T, it returns another XML tree that would be produced by executing its embedded update on T, without destructive impact on T. Transform queries support a variety of applications including XML hypothetical queries, the simulation of updates on virtual views, and the enforcement of XML access control. In light of the wide-range of applications for transform queries, we develop automaton-based techniques for efficiently evaluating transform queries and for computing their compositions with user queries in standard XQuery. We provide (a)three algorithms to implement transform queries without change to existing XQuery processors,(b) a linear-time algorithm, based on a seamless integration of automaton execution and SAX parsing, to evaluate\u00a0\u2026", "Streaming spatio-textual data that contains geolocations and textual contents, e.g., geo-tagged tweets, is becoming increasingly available. Users can register continuous queries to receive up-to-date results continuously, or pose snapshot queries to receive results instantly. The large scale of spatio-textual data streams and huge amounts of queries pose great challenges to the current location-based services, and call for more efficient data management systems. In this paper, we present SSTD (Streaming Spatio-Textual Data), a distributed in-memory system supporting both continuous and snapshot queries with spatial, textual, and temporal constraints over data streams. Compared with existing distributed data stream management systems, SSTD has at least three novelty: (1) It supports more types of queries over streamed spatio-textual data; (2)SSTD adopts a novel workload partitioning method termed QT (Quad\u00a0\u2026", "With the proliferation of mobile devices and location-based services, continuous generation of massive volume of streaming spatial objects (i.e., geo-tagged data) opens up new opportunities to address real-world problems by analyzing them.

Specifically, a bursty region shows maximum spike in the number of spatial objects in a given time window. The SURGE problem is useful in addressing several real-world challenges such as surge pricing problem in online transportation and disease outbreak detection. To solve the problem, we propose an exact solution and two approximate solutions, and the approximation ratio is 1-\u03b1/4 in terms of the burst score, where \u03b1 is a parameter to control the burst score\u00a0\u2026", "Category hierarchies often evolve at a much slower pace than the documents reside in. With newly available documents kept adding into a hierarchy, new topics emerge and documents within the same category become less topically cohesive. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic approach to modifying a given category hierarchy by redistributing its documents into more topically cohesive categories. The modification is achieved with three operations (namely, sprout, merge, and assign) with reference to an auxiliary hierarchy for additional semantic information; the auxiliary hierarchy covers a similar set of topics as the hierarchy to be modified. Our user study shows that the modified category hierarchy is semantically meaningful. As an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on document classification using real data from Yahoo!

Specifically, we first propose a traffic context aware skip-gram module to incorporate auxiliary tasks of predicting the traffic context of a target road segment. Furthermore, we propose a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module that utilizes trajectory data to extract traveling semantics on road networks. Apart from obtaining effective road segment representations, this module also enables us to obtain the route representations. With these two modules, we can learn representations which can capture multi-faceted characteristics of road networks to be applied in both road segment based applications and trajectory based applications.

This article investigates a light-weight data reduction technique for speeding-up shortest path and distance queries on large graphs. To do this, we propose a notion of routing proxies (or simply proxies), each of which represents a small subgraph, referred to as deterministic routing areas (DRAs). We first show that routing proxies hold good properties for speeding-up shortest path and distance queries. Then, we design a linear-time algorithm to compute routing proxies and their corresponding DRAs. Finally, we experimentally verify that our solution is a general technique for reducing graph sizes and speeding-up shortest path and distance queries, using real-life large graphs.", "Spatial web objects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence. This gives prominence to spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual arguments. Such queries are used in many web services such as yellow pages and maps services.

Specifically, SWORS supports two types of queries: a) the location-aware top-k text retrieval (LkT) query that retrieves k individual spatial web objects taking into account query location proximity and text relevancy; b) the spatial keyword group (SKG) query that retrieves a group of objects that cover the query keywords and are nearest to the query location and have the shortest inter-object distances.

Before constructing the tree structure, we use PCA to transform the extracted features into a new space sorted by the importance of acoustic features. The CF-tree is a balanced multi-way tree structure where each level represents the data space at different dimensionalities.

Application scenarios of group recommendation include, for example, having dinners with colleagues, going to the cinema with spouses, and going picnic with friends.

However, several recent papers have pointed out critical issues with the evaluation process in recommender systems. Likewise, this paper takes an in-depth look at a fundamental but often neglected aspect of the evaluation procedure, i.e. the datasets themselves. To do so, we adopt a systematic and comprehensive approach to understand the datasets used for implicit feedback based top-K recommendation. We start by examining recent papers from top-tier conferences to find out how different datasets have been utilised thus far. Next, we look at the characteristics of these datasets to understand their similarities and differences.

They require to replace both the indices and query processing algorithms currently deployed by the databases, and such a radical departure is likely to encounter challenges and obstacles. In contrast, we propose a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to improve on the query performance of the classic R-Tree without the need of changing its structure or query processing algorithms. Specifically, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic rules currently used by R-Tree and its variants. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with up to more than 100 million spatial objects clearly show that our RL based index outperforms R-Tree and its variants in terms of query processing time.", "Time series similarity computation is a fundamental primitive that underpins many time series data analysis tasks. However, many existing time series similarity measures have a high computation cost. While there has been much research effort for reducing the computational cost, such effort is usually specific to one similarity measure.

NeuTS  computes the similarity of a given time series pair in linear time and generic to handle any existing similarity measures.  NeuTS  samples a number of seed time series from the given database, and then uses their pair-wise similarities as guidance to approximate the similarity function with a neural metric learning framework.

When commenting on an entity, users often mention other entities for reference or comparison. Compared with web pages and tweets, the problem of disambiguating the mentioned entities in user comments has not received much attention. This paper investigates linking fine-grained locations in Foursquare comments. We demonstrate that the focal location, i.e., the location that a comment is posted on, provides rich contexts for the linking task. To exploit such information, we represent the Foursquare data in a graph, which includes locations, comments, and their relations. A probabilistic model named FocalLink is proposed to estimate the probability that a user mentions a location when commenting on a focal location, by following different\u00a0\u2026", "Computing trajectory similarities is a critical and fundamental task for various spatial-temporal applications, such as clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. Traditional similarity metrics, i.e. DTW and Hausdorff, suffer from quadratic computation complexity, leading to their inability on large-scale data. To solve this problem, many trajectory representation learning techniques are proposed to approximate the metric space while reducing the complexity of similarity computation. Nevertheless, these works are designed based on RNN backend, resulting in a serious performance decline on long trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely TrajGAT, to explicitly model the hierarchical spatial structure and improve the performance of long trajectory similarity computation. TrajGAT consists of two main modules, i.e. , graph construction and trajectory encoding.

This data typically also contains non-location information. We study how to use such information to characterize a region and then how to find a region of the same size and with the most similar characteristics. This functionality enables a user to identify regions that share characteristics with a user-supplied region that the user is familiar with and likes. More specifically, we formalize and study a new problem called the attribute-aware similar region search (ASRS) problem. We first define so-called composite aggregators that are able to express aspects of interest in terms of the information associated with a user-supplied region. When applied to a region, an aggregator captures the region's relevant characteristics. Next, given a query region and a composite aggregator, we propose a novel algorithm called DS-Search to find the most similar region of the same size. Unlike any previous work on region search, DS-Search repeatedly discretizes and splits regions until an split region either satisfies a drop condition or it is guaranteed to not contribute to the result. In addition, we extend DS-Search to solve the ASRS problem approximately. Finally, we report on extensive empirical studies that offer insight into the efficiency and effectiveness of the paper's proposals.", "A large body of research has focused on efficient and scalable processing of subgraph search queries on large networks. In these efforts, a query is posed in the form of a connected query graph. Unfortunately, in practice end users may not always have precise knowledge about the topological relationships between nodes in a query graph to formulate a connected query. In this paper, we present a novel graph querying paradigm called partial topology-based network search and propose a query processing framework called panda to efficiently process partial topology query (ptq) in a single machine. A ptq is a disconnected query graph containing multiple connected query components. ptqs allow an end user to formulate queries without demanding precise information about the complete topology of a query graph.

However, a single graphical model cannot accurately characterize the complicated causal relationships for a relatively large graph. In this paper, we propose the problem of estimating an overlapping decomposition for Gaussian graphical models of a large scale to generate overlapping sub-graphical models. Specifically, we formulate an objective function for the overlapping decomposition problem and propose an approximate algorithm for it. A key theory of the algorithm is that the problem of solving a \u03ba+1 node graphical model can be reduced to the problem of solving a one-step regularization based on a solved \u03ba node graphical model.

Existing algorithms usually involve some decision making tasks (e.g., deciding which point to drop), for which, some human-crafted rules are used. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy for the decision making tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop trajectory simplification methods based on the learned policy.

Existing mining schemes treat each iteration as a distinct mining process, and fail to exploit the information generated between iterations. We propose to salvage knowledge that is discovered from an earlier iteration of mining to enhance subsequent rounds of mining. In particular, we look at how frequent patterns can be recycled. Our proposed strategy operates in two phases. In the first phase, frequent patterns obtained from an early iteration are used to compress a database. In the second phase, subsequent mining processes operate on the compressed database.

The interaction between XPath recursion and DAG compression of XML views makes the analysis of the XML view update problem rather intriguing. Furthermore, many issues are still open even for relational view updates, and need to be explored. In response to these, on the XML side, we revise the notion of side effects and update semantics based on the semantics of XML views, and present effecient algorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates.

Furthermore, current ER approaches are mainly based on attribute similarity comparison, but ignore interdependence between attributes. To address the limits of existing methods, we propose HierGAT, a new method for ER based on a Hierarchical Graph Attention Transformer Network, which can model and exploit the interdependence between different ER decisions.

However, most existing association rule mining algorithms are rendered impractical on gene expression data, which typically contains thousands or tens of thousands of columns (gene expression levels), but only tens of rows (samples). The main problem is that these algorithms have an exponential dependence on the number of columns. Another shortcoming is evident that too many associations are generated from such kind of data. To this end, we have developed a novel depth-first row-wise algorithm FARMER [2] that is specially designed to efficiently discover and cluster association rules into interesting rule groups (IRGs) that satisfy user-specified minimum support, confidence and chi-square value thresholds on biological datasets as opposed to finding association rules individually. Based on FARMER, we have developed a prototype system that integrates semantic mining and visual analysis of IRGs mined from gene expression data.", "Similar trajectory search is a crucial task that facilitates many downstream spatial data analytic applications. Despite its importance, many of the current literature focus solely on the trajectory\u2019s spatial similarity while neglecting the temporal information. Additionally, the few papers that use both the spatial and temporal features based their approach on a traditional point-to-point comparison. These methods model the importance of the spatial and temporal aspect of the data with only a single, pre-defined balancing factor for all trajectories, even though the relative spatial and temporal balance can change from trajectory to trajectory.

As there are no simple semantic mappings between the taxonomies of the CQA services, the integration of CQA services is a challenging task. The existing approaches on integrating taxonomies ignore the hierarchical structures of the source taxonomy.

In this paper, we conduct a pioneer study on searching a community with high modularity. We point out that while modularity has been popularly used in community detection (without query nodes), it has not been adopted for community search, surprisingly, and its application in community search (related to query nodes) brings in new challenges.

For a high-dimensional similarity learning problem, projection is usually adopted to map high-dimensional features into low-dimensional space, in order to reduce the computational cost. However, dimensionality reduction method sometimes results in unstable performance due to the suboptimal solution in original space. In this paper, we propose a dual random projection framework for similarity learning to recover the original optimal solution from subspace optimal solution. Previous dual random projection methods usually make strong assumptions about the data, which need to be low rank or have a large margin. Those assumptions limit dual random projection applications in similarity learning. Thus, we adopt a dual-sparse regularized random projection method that introduces a sparse regularizer into the reduced dual problem. As the original dual solution is a sparse one, applying a sparse regularizer in the reduced space relaxes the low-rank assumption. Experimental results show that our method enjoys higher effectiveness and efficiency than state-of-the-art solutions.", "With the proliferation of local services and GPS-enabled mobile phones, reverse spatial-keyword Nearest Neighbor queries are becoming an important type of query.

Translating query execution plans into their vectorized representations is non-trivial. Recently, several query plan representation methods have been proposed. However, they have two limitations. First, they do not fully utilize readily available database statistics in the representation, which characterizes the data distribution. Second, they typically have difficulty in modeling long paths of information flow in a query plan, and capturing parent-children dependency between operators. To tackle these limitations, we propose QueryFormer, a learning-based query plan representation model with a tree-structured Transformer architecture. In particular, we propose a novel scheme to integrate histograms obtained from database systems into query plan encoding.

Most of the existing methods for relationship inference are not targeted at POI, thus failing to capture unique spatial characteristics that have huge effects on POI relationships. In this work we propose PRIM to tackle POI relationship inference for multiple relation types. PRIM features four novel components, including a weighted relational graph neural network, category taxonomy integration, a self-attentive spatial context extractor, and a distance-specific scoring function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that PRIM achieves the best results compared to state-of-the-art baselines and it is robust against data sparsity and is applicable to unseen cases in practice.", "With the proliferation of commercial tracking systems, sports data is being generated at an unprecedented speed and the interest in sports play retrieval has grown dramatically as well, where a play corresponds to a fragment of a game. Existing solutions for similar play retrieval usually assume that a database of plays are materialized, which, however, is not well aligned with the practice that data is stored in units of game. In this paper, we propose to search for similar plays directly from a database of games. We tackle three challenges of the task, namely (1) how to measure the similarity between two plays, (2) how to efficiently find a similar play to a query play within a game, and (3) how to efficiently find a similar play within a database of many games. For the first challenge, we propose a deep learning approach called play2vec to learn the representations of sports plays. play2vec is robust against noise and runs\u00a0\u2026", "Trajectory data has been widely used in various applications, including taxi services, traffic management, mobility analysis, etc. It is usually collected at a sensor's side in real time and corresponds to a sequence of sampled points. Constrained by the storage and/or network bandwidth of a sensor, it is common to simplify raw trajectory data when it is collected by dropping some sampled points. Many algorithms have been proposed for the error-bounded online trajectory simplification (EB-OTS) problem, which is to drop as many points as possible subject to that the error is bounded by an error tolerance. Nevertheless, these existing algorithms rely on pre-defined rules for decision making during the trajectory simplification process and there is no theoretical ground supporting their effectiveness.

In this work, we aim to mine the topics and the market competition of different brands over each topic for a category of business (e.g., coffeehouses) from spatio-temporal documents within a user-specified region and time period. To support such spatio-temporal search online in an exploratory manner, we propose a novel framework equipped by (1) a generative model for mining topics and market competition, (2) an Octree-based off-line pre-training method for the model and (3) an\u00a0\u2026", "Query expansion has received extensive attention in information retrieval community.

To find an optimum index configuration for a workload, accurately and efficiently quantifying the benefits of each candidate index configuration is indispensable. As materializing each index configuration candidate and physically executing queries are infeasible, most of index tuners rely on the cost estimations from optimizer with \"what-if\" API. However, \"what-if\" based index benefit estimations have the following two limitations. Firstly, they generate significant errors, which compromise index recommendation quality. Secondly, generating query plans and benefit estimations for each candidate index configuration takes a considerable amount of time. To address the two challenges in index selection, we propose an effective end-to-end machine learning based index benefit estimator.

The problem of proximity detection is often encountered in friend-locator applications and massively multiplayer online games. Because of the limited battery power and bandwidth, it is better to develop a solution which incurs less communication cost. Hence, the main objective of this problem is to reduce the total communication cost. However, most of the existing proximity detection solutions focus on the Euclidean space but cannot be used in road network space; the solutions for road networks incur substantial communication costs. Motivated by this, we propose two types of solutions to solve the proximity detection problem in road\u00a0\u2026", "High-dimensional sparse data is prevalent in many real-life applications. In this paper, we propose a novel index structure for accelerating similarity search in high-dimensional sparse databases, named ISIS, which stands for Indexing Sparse databases using Inverted fileS.

A salient feature of the system is that publishing, integration and view maintenance are schema-directed: they are conducted strictly following a user-specified (possibly recursive and complex) XML schema, and guarantee that the generated or modified XML document conforms to the predefined schema. We discuss techniques underlying PRATA and report the current status of the system.", "Most supervised geographic mapping methods with very-high-resolution (VHR) images are designed for a specific task, leading to high label-dependency and inadequate task-generality. Additionally, the lack of socio-economic information in VHR images limits their applicability to social/human-related geographic studies. To resolve these two issues, we propose an unsupervised multi-modal geographic representation learning framework (MMGR) using both VHR images and points-of-interest (POIs), to learn representations (regional vector embeddings) carrying both the physical and socio-economic properties of the geographies. In MMGR, we employ an intra-modal and an inter-modal contrastive learning module, in which the former deeply mines visual features by contrasting different VHR image augmentations, while the latter fuses physical and socio-economic features by contrasting VHR image and POI\u00a0\u2026", "Unsupervised region representation learning aims to extract dense and effective features from unlabeled urban data. While some efforts have been made for solving this problem based on multiple views, existing methods are still insufficient in extracting representations in a view and/or incorporating representations from different views.

We evaluate the learned representations on real datasets and the results verified the effectiveness of s2vec when used for spatial clustering.", "In this demonstration we present POIsam, a visualization system supporting the following desirable features: representativeness, visibility constraint, zooming consistency, and panning consistency. The first two constraints aim to efficiently select a small set of representative objects from the current region of user's interest, and any two selected objects should not be too close to each other for users to distinguish in the limited space of a screen. One unique feature of POISam is that any similarity metrics can be plugged into POISam to meet the user's specific needs in different scenarios. The latter two consistencies are fundamental challenges to efficiently update the selection result w.r.t. user's zoom in, zoom out and panning operations when they interact with the map.

We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose a framework to find the traffic bottlenecks as follows. First, a traffic spread model is defined which represents changes in traffic volume for each road segment over time.

In the proposed approach, we extract four types of functional features from Chemical Functional Group (CFG) Graph built from a chemical structural formula, and use them for the first time for chemical retrieval. The extracted chemical functional features are then used for similarity measurement and query retrieval.

First, we extract the KMV synopses for each item from the stream. Then, we propose a novel estimator to estimate the frequency of an itemset over the KMV synopses. Comparing to the existing estimator, our method is not only more accurate and efficient to calculate but also follows the downward-closure property.

It is often not feasible to compute a complete data cube due to the huge storage requirement. Recently proposed quotient cube [10] addressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalence partitions. Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such as SUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN. After that, a efficient data structure called QC-tree [11] is also proposed by the same authors. While the important incremental maintenance problem is tackled in the paper, aggregation was considered only in a limited sense; for example, aggregation with holistic aggregation function was not allowed. To update the value of holistic aggregation is very difficult since all history tuple values must be kept and the new aggregate value needs to be recomputed even after one tuple is inserted or deleted. Expensive space and time cost make it to be unrealistic to update a holistic aggregation. In this paper, we introduced two techniques called addset data structure and sliding window to deal with this problem. We developed efficient algorithm for maintaining a quotient cube with holistic aggregation functions that takes up reasonably small storage space.

Recently, deep learning-based approaches have gained much popularity for effectively modeling temporal and spatial dependencies in MTS, specifically in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) and Spatial-Temporal Forecasting (STF). However, the fair benchmarking issue and the choice of technical approaches have been hotly debated in related work. Such controversies significantly hinder our understanding of progress in this field. Thus, this paper aims to address these controversies to present insights into advancements achieved. To resolve benchmarking issues, we introduce BasicTS, a benchmark designed for fair comparisons in MTS forecasting. BasicTS establishes a unified training pipeline and reasonable evaluation settings, enabling an unbiased evaluation of over 30 popular MTS forecasting models on more than 18 datasets. Furthermore, we highlight the heterogeneity among MTS datasets and classify them based on temporal and spatial characteristics. We further prove that neglecting heterogeneity is the primary reason for generating controversies in technical approaches. Moreover, based on the proposed BasicTS and rich heterogeneous MTS datasets, we conduct an exhaustive and reproducible performance and efficiency comparison of popular models, providing insights for researchers in selecting and designing MTS forecasting models.", "Pre-trained Foundation Models (PFMs) have ushered in a paradigm-shift in Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to learn general-purpose representations that can be readily employed in a wide range of downstream tasks. While PFMs have been successfully adopted in various fields such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, their capacity in handling geospatial data and answering urban questions remains limited. This can be attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of geospatial data, which encompasses different data types, including points, segments and regions, as well as multiple information modalities, such as a spatial position, visual characteristics and textual annotations. The proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information initiatives, and the ever-increasing availability of open geospatial data sources, like OpenStreetMap, which is freely accessible globally, unveil a promising opportunity to bridge this gap. In this paper, we present CityFM, a self-supervised framework to train a foundation model within a selected geographical area of interest, such as a city. CityFM relies solely on open data from OSM, and produces multimodal representations of entities of different types, incorporating spatial, visual, and textual information. We analyse the entity representations generated using our foundation models from a qualitative perspective, and conduct quantitative experiments on road, building, and region-level downstream tasks.

To address this challenge, we propose a new model that integrates multiple Gaussian mixture models and a deep autoregressive model. On the one hand, Gaussian mixture models can fit the distribution of continuous attributes and reduce their domain sizes. On the other hand, deep autoregressive model can learn the joint data distribution with reduced domain attributes. In experiments, we compare with multiple baselines on 4 real-world datasets containing continuous attributes, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve up to 20 times higher accuracy than the second best estimators, while using less space and inference time.", "Many well-established recommender systems are based on representation learning in Euclidean space.

In this paper, we argue that Hyperbolic space is more suitable for learning user-item embeddings in the recommendation domain. Unlike Euclidean spaces, Hyperbolic spaces are intrinsically equipped to handle hierarchical structure, encouraged by its property of exponentially increasing distances away from origin.

To address this challenge, we propose using an attention mechanism to capture the impact of each user in a group. Specifically, our model learns the influence weight of each user in a group and recommends items to the group based on its members' weighted preferences. Moreover, our model can dynamically adjust the weight of each user across the groups; thus, the model provides a new and flexible method to model the complicated group decision making process, which differentiates us from other existing solutions.

In this paper, we extend an existing Gibbs sampling method, and propose a new deterministic Heron inference (Heron) for a family of Bayesian graphical models. In addition to the support for nontrivial distributability, one more benefit of Heron is that it is able to not only allow us to easily assess the convergence status but also largely improve the running efficiency. We evaluate Heron against the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler and state-of-the-art state augmentation method in inference for well-known graphical models. Experimental results using publicly available real-life data have demonstrated that Heron significantly outperforms the baseline methods for inferring Bayesian graphical models.", "Tagging Your Tweets | CiNii Research CiNii \u56fd\u7acb\u60c5\u5831\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240 \u5b66\u8853\u60c5\u5831\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf[\u30b5\u30a4\u30cb\u30a3] \n\u8ad6\u6587\u30fb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 \u5927\u5b66\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u306e\u672c\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587\u3092\u3055\u304c\u3059 English \u691c\u7d22 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb \u4eba\u7269\n/\u56e3\u4f53\u540d \u6240\u5c5e\u6a5f\u95a2 ISSN DOI \u671f\u9593 ~ \u672c\u6587\u30ea\u30f3\u30af \u672c\u6587\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u3042\u308a \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9 JaLC IRDB Crossref \nDataCite NDL NDL-Digital RUDA JDCat NINJAL CiNii Articles CiNii Books CiNii Dissertations \nDBpedia Nikkei BP KAKEN Integbio \u516c\u5171\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0 \u3059\u3079\u3066 \u7814\u7a76\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf \u8ad6\u6587 \u672c \u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587 \n\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 [4/18\u66f4\u65b0]CiNii Articles\u306eCiNii Research\u3078\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 Tagging Your Tweets \nDOI Web Site \u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u6587\u732e2\u4ef6 Zongyang Ma Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, \nSingapore Aixin Sun Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Quan Yuan \nNanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore Gao Cong Nanyang Technological \nUniversity, Singapore, Singapore \u66f8\u8a8c\u4e8b\u9805 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u5225\u540d A Probabilistic Modeling of Hashtag \u2026", "Community Question Answering (CQA) is a popular type of service where users ask questions and where answers are obtained from other users or from historical question-answer pairs. CQA archives contain large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchy of categories. As an essential function of CQA services, question retrieval in a CQA archive aims to retrieve historical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. This article presents several new approaches to exploiting the category information of questions for improving the performance of question retrieval, and it applies these approaches to existing question retrieval models, including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model.

This is typically done by specifying some initial values of the constraints that are subsequently refined iteratively until satisfactory results are obtained. Most of existing schemes fail to exploit the frequent patterns from an early round of mining for subsequent iterations.In this chapter, a novel technique is proposed to solve this problem. Using the relaxation of frequency constraint (the decrease of minimum support) as an example, this chapter first proposes the concept of tree boundary to summarize and to reorganize the previous mining results. This chaper then shows that the additional frequent itemsets can be generated in the new mining process by extending only the itemsets on the tree boundary without re-generating the frequent itemsets produced in the previous mining.", "Frequent substructure discovery from a collection of semi-structured objects can serve for storage, browsing, querying, indexing and classification of semi-structured documents. This paper examines the problem of discovering frequent substructures from a collection of hierarchical semi-structured objects of the same type. The use of wildcard is an important aspect of substructure discovery from semi-structured data due to the irregularity and lack of fixed structure of such data. This paper proposes a more general and powerful wildcard mechanism, which allows us to find more complex and interesting substructures than existing techniques. Furthermore, the complexity of structural information of semi-structured data and the usage of wildcard make the existing frequent set mining algorithms inapplicable for substructure discovery. In this work, we adopt a vertical format for the storage of semi-structured objects, and adapt a frequent set mining algorithm for our purpose. The application of our approach to real-life data shows that it is very effective.", null, "Learned indices have been proposed to replace classic index structures like B-Tree with machine learning (ML) models. They require to replace both the indices and query processing algorithms currently deployed by the databases, and such a radical departure is likely to encounter challenges and obstacles. In contrast, we propose a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to build a better R-Tree without the need to change the structure or query processing algorithms of traditional R-Tree. Specifically, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building and updating an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic rules currently used by the R-Tree and its variants. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with up to more than 100 million spatial objects show that our RL based index outperforms the R-Tree and its variants in terms of query processing time."]}, "collaboration_network": {"target": ["Christian S.
