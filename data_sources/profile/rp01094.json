K. NG works in machine learning, privacy-preserving techniques, query-permissible encrypted databases, enterprise blockchain systems, data security, and blockchain security. His work is motivated by the need to harness the power of data for the betterment of stakeholders, where the data has confidentiality and privacy issues; where the data may be owned and held by different stakeholders, and where the data is so large that it must be hosted in cloud servers that are never completely secured (susceptible to insider and cyber attacks). He contributes to companies and industries as technology consultant on projects involving data analytics, artificial intelligence, data privacy and security, and blockchain. In recent years, his involvement in conferences and workshop can be found here. His work is supported by various research grants, which can be found here. He is Associate Editor and Member of Editorial Boards of five journals. Over the years, he has worked with many talented students on their PhD and Master theses. Dr. Ng writes for online magazines and newspapers and contributes to social causes.", "orcid": null, "other_websites": ["https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/awkng"], "bachelor_degree": null, "masters": null,
