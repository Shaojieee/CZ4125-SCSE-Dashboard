control problems can be formulated as nonlinear optimization with a system-wide objective, e.g., maximizing the total system throughput or the worst user throughput, subject to QoS constraints from individual users, e.g., on data rate, delay, and outage probability. We show that in the high Signal-to- interference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the\u00a0\u2026", "Transmit power in wireless cellular networks is a key degree of freedom in the management of interference, energy, and connectivity. Power control in both the uplink and downlink of a cellular network has been extensively studied, especially over the last 15 years, and some of the results have enabled the continuous evolution and significant impact of the digital cellular technology.", "Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) uses auction-based spot pricing to sell spare capacity, allowing users to bid for cloud resources at a highly reduced rate. Amazon sets the spot price dynamically and accepts user bids above this price. Jobs with lower bids (including those already running) are interrupted and must wait for a lower spot price before resuming. Spot pricing thus raises two basic questions: how might the provider set the price, and what prices should users bid? Computing users' bidding strategies is particularly challenging: higher bid prices reduce the probability of, and thus extra time to recover from, interruptions, but may increase users' cost. We address these questions in three steps: (1) modeling the cloud provider's setting of the spot price and matching the model to historically offered prices, (2) deriving optimal bidding strategies for different job requirements and interruption overheads, and\u00a0\u2026", "Suppose that a rumor originating from a single source among a set of suspects spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source? With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and a snapshot observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model. We propose to use a notion of local rumor center to characterize P c (n), the correct detection probability of the source estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes, for regular trees of node degree \u03b4. First, when all nodes are suspects, lim n\u2192\u221e P c (n) grows from 0.25 to 0.307 as \u03b4 increases from three to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different approach; furthermore, P c (n) monotonically decreases with n and increases with \u03b4 even in the finite-n regime.

At the same time, charging a large fleet of EVs distributed across the residential area poses a challenge for the distribution network. In this paper, we formulate this problem by building on the optimal power flow (OPF) framework to model the network constraints that arises from charging EVs at different locations. To overcome the computational challenge when the control horizon is long, we study a nested optimization approach to decompose the joint OPF and EV charging problem. We characterize the optimal EV charging schedule to be a valley-filling profile, which allows us to develop an efficient offline algorithm with significantly lower computational complexity compared to centralized interior point solvers. Furthermore, we propose a decentralized online algorithm that dynamically\u00a0\u2026", "This paper addresses the problem of a single rumor source detection with multiple observations, from a statistical point of view of a spreading over a network, based on the susceptible-infectious model. For tree networks, multiple sequential observations for one single instance of rumor spreading cannot improve over the initial snapshot observation. The situation dramatically improves for multiple independent observations. We propose a unified inference framework based on the union rumor centrality, and provide explicit detection performance for degree-regular tree networks. Surprisingly, even with merely two observations, the detection probability at least doubles that of a single observation, and further approaches one, i.e., reliable detection, with increasing degree.

These approaches are either too restricted to capture students' learning level, or require heavy supervision from the instructors to ensure the grades are fair. In this paper, we propose a rank-aggregation-based peer-grading method that estimates the quality of each assignment and the probability that each student is grading unbiasedly. The estimation errors have theoretical upper-bounds, and the bounds can be proved to tighten when the\u00a0\u2026", "Proving or disproving linear information theoretic inequalities is a fundamental task in information theory, and it has also been proved to be important in fields like cryptography and quantum communication theory. Manually proving information inequalities involving more than a few random variables can often be tedious or even intractable. In 1997, Yeung proposed a linear programming framework for verifying information inequalities, which was later extended to construct analytical proofs and disproofs. However, in practice this framework can be very slow for inequalities involving more than ten random variables, thus it is impossible to be applied to a wide range of practical problems. In this paper, we further extend this optimization-theoretic framework by reformulating the LPs and applying the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) technique, where all the subproblems have closed-form solutions and\u00a0\u2026", "A fundamental challenge of a smart grid is: to what extent can moving energy through space and time be optimized to benefit the power network with large-scale storage integration? In this paper, we study a dynamic optimal power flow problem with energy storage dynamics in resistive power networks. We first propose a second order cone programming convex relaxation to solve this nonconvex problem optimally. Then, we apply optimization decomposition techniques to decompose and decouple the problem and obtain the global optimal solution in a distributed manner. The optimization decomposition offers new interesting insight over space and time between the dual solution and energy storage dynamics. We investigate the efficiency of the SOCP relaxation in several IEEE benchmark systems and verify that the distributed algorithms can converge fast to the global optimal solution by numerical simulations.", "In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the beamformer and the power in a multiuser downlink system wherein the number of transmit antennas and the number of users grow asymptotically large with a bounded ratio. The max-min weighted SINR problem with a weighted sum power constraint is considered. Techniques developed from random matrix theory are employed to derive asymptotically optimal solutions that only rely on statistical channel information and can be further leveraged to design the asymptotically optimal beamformers in a non-iterative manner. Moreover, by using nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory and random matrix theory, an effective uplink system and an effective downlink system are proposed to characterize and interpret the asymptotically optimal solutions.", "Designing fast algorithms that adapt the transmit and receive power and beamformers to optimize performance for different users is important in wireless MIMO downlink systems. This paper studies the max-min weighted SIR problem in the downlink, where multiple users are weighted according to priority and are subject to a total power constraint. The difficulty of this nonconvex problem is compounded by the coupling in the transmit and receive beamformers, thereby making it hard to optimize in a distributed fashion. We first show that this problem can be optimally and efficiently computed using a fast algorithm when the channels are rank-one. The optimal transmit and receive power and beamformers are also derived analytically. We then exploit the MIMO uplink-downlink duality to adapt our algorithm to compute a local optimal solution for channels with general rank.", "FAST Copper is a multi-year, U.S. NSF funded project that started in 2004, and is jointly pursued by the research groups of Mung Chiang at Princeton University, John Cioffi at Stanford University, and Alexader Fraser at Fraser Research Lab, and in collaboration with several industrial partners including AT&T. The goal of the FAST Copper Project is to provide ubiquitous, 100 Mbps, fiber/DSL broadband access to everyone in the U.S. with a phone line. This goal will be achieved through two threads of research: dynamic and joint optimization of resources in Frequency, Amplitude, Space, and Time (thus the name 'FAST') to overcome the attenuation and crosstalk bottlenecks, and the integration of communication, networking, computation, modeling, and distributed information management and control for the multi-user twisted pair network.", "Hilbert\u2019s 24th problem was about a criterion for the simplicity of mathematical proofs, but there can be a variety of plausible criterion for proof simplicity, each leading to a different way to search for proofs. Possibly, the right kind of proof simplicity criterion may even enable computers to prove theorems in the field of artificial intelligence. The premise of this paper is automated reasoning by convex optimization in which optimization-theoretic tools, when viewed in the context of interactive theorem proving, can automate the task of generating insights and reasoning by computers solving specially-crafted convex optimization problems.

We show that the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem, which can be efficiently solved to determine the optimal amount of time for each task. We also report our ongoing attempts to apply this theory to our Facebook Messenger chatbot software that can optimize the trade-off between learning and self-assessing in form of MCQs on the chatbot platform.", "Detecting information source in viral spreading has important applications such as to root out the culprit of a rumor spreading in online social networks. In particular, given a snapshot observation of the network topology of nodes having the rumor, how to accurately identify the initial source of the spreading? In the seminal work [Shah et el. 2011], this problem was formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem and solved using a rumor centrality approach for graphs that are degree-regular trees. The case of graphs with cycles is an open problem. In this paper, we address the maximum likelihood estimation problem by a generalized rumor centrality for spreading in unicyclic graphs. In particular, we derive a generalized rumor centrality that leads to a new graph-theoretic design approach to inference algorithms.", "Whether superposition (source separation) Is optimal for the asymmetric multilevel diversity coding systems (AMDCS) with perfect secrecy is answered in this paper by studying a non-trivial example. Threshold perfect secrecy is added to the AMDCS model. The eavesdropper may have access to any one but not more than one subset of the channels but can get nothing about the sources, as long as the size of the subset is not above the security level. The secure AMDCS (S-AMDCS) with five sources, four encoders and security level two is solved and it is shown that linear codes are optimal for this instance. However, in contrast with the secure symmetric multilevel diversity coding systems (S-SMDCS), superposition is shown to be not optimal for S-AMDCS in general from this counterexample.", "Network coding achieves multicast network capacity by allowing intermediate nodes to mix information in packets. However, due to the mixing operation, network coding is vulnerable to pollution attacks. Different from conventional cryptographic solutions, watchdog-based solutions, which have been recently proposed for network coding, rely on trusted nodes to monitor and verify behaviors of transmission nodes. However, the impact of lossy wireless communications has not been considered. Since false alarm and misdetection depend on the loss rate, these false results can happen with high probability when packet loss happens.

Undoubtedly, nothing spreads faster than fear.", "The rapid global spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has severely impacted daily life worldwide. As potential solutions, various digital contact tracing (DCT) strategies have emerged to mitigate the virus\u2019s spread while maintaining economic and social activities. The computational epidemiology problems of DCT often involve parameter optimization through learning processes, making it crucial to understand how to apply machine learning techniques for effective DCT optimization. While numerous research studies on DCT have emerged recently, most existing reviews primarily focus on DCT application design and implementation. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of privacy-preserving machine learning-based DCT in preparation for future pandemics. We propose a new taxonomy to classify existing DCT strategies into forward, backward, and proactive contact tracing. We then categorize several DCT apps developed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on their tracing strategies. Furthermore, we derive three research questions related to computational epidemiology for DCT and provide a detailed description of machine learning techniques to address these problems. We discuss the challenges of learning-based DCT and suggest potential solutions. Additionally, we include a case study demonstrating the review\u2019s insights into the pandemic response. Finally, we summarize the study\u2019s limitations and highlight promising future research directions in DCT.", "The goal of digital contact tracing is to diminish the spread of an epidemic or pandemic by detecting and mitigating public health emergencies using digital technologies. Since the start of the COVID- pandemic, a wide variety of mobile digital apps have been deployed to identify people exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and to stop onward transmission. Tracing sources of spreading (i.e., backward contact tracing), as has been used in Japan and Australia, has proven crucial as going backwards can pick up infections that might otherwise be missed at superspreading events. How should robust backward contact tracing automated by mobile computing and network analytics be designed? In this paper, we formulate the forward and backward contact tracing problem for epidemic source inference as maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation subject to subgraph sampling. Besides its restricted case (inspired by the seminal work of Zaman and Shah in 2011) when the full infection topology is known, the general problem is more challenging due to its sheer combinatorial complexity, problem scale and the fact that the full infection topology is rarely accurately known. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, named DeepTrace, to compute the ML estimator by leveraging the likelihood structure to configure the training set with topological features of smaller epidemic networks as training sets. We demonstrate that the performance of our GNN approach improves over prior heuristics in the literature and serves as a basis to design robust contact tracing analytics to combat pandemics.", "AbstractStatistical network analysis plays a critical role in managing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infodemic such as addressing community detection and rumor source detection problems in social networks. As the data underlying infodemiology are fundamentally huge graphs and statistical in nature, there are computational challenges to the design of graph algorithms and algorithmic speedup. A framework that leverages cloud computing is key to designing scalable data analytics for infodemic control.

Our MEGA framework consists of first pruning, followed by hierarchical clustering based on geodesic distance and then parallel computing, lending itself readily to parallel computing software, e.g., MapReduce or Hadoop. In particular, we illustrate how our MEGA framework computes two representative graph problems for infodemic control, namely network motif counting for community detection and network centrality computation for rumor source detection. Interesting special cases of optimal tuning in the MEGA framework are identified based on geodesic distance characterization and random graph model analysis.

We study a joint rate and power control optimization to achieve egalitarian fairness (max-min weighted fairness) in multiuser wireless networks. The key challenge to optimizing the fairness of maximizing the data rates for all the users is the nonconvexity and of the problem. We exploit the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory and nonnegative matrix theory to solve this nonconvex resource control problem. A fixed-point algorithm that resembles a nonlinear version of the Power Method in linear algebra and converges very fast to the optimal solution is also proposed.", "This paper studies the joint beamforming and power control in a multiuser distributed antenna uplink network, wherein the number of users and the number of separately located antennas grow large with ratio being bounded. We consider the SINR fairness problem under individual power constraint and present a distributed iterative algorithm. This algorithm, though converging to the instantaneous optimal solution, requires instantaneous power update. In order to design a low complexity algorithm that achieves optimality in the asymptotic sense, we leverage the large system structure to derive an asymptotic solution requiring only channel statistics. In this algorithm, the asymptotic power is slowly updated and the asymptotic beamformer can be obtained in a non-iterative manner. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm is also studied.", "This paper studies efficient signal transmission strategies in a multiuser MIMO network where multiple source nodes form a large virtual MIMO array to perform cooperative beamforming. In order to reduce instantaneous feedback needs, we investigate joint power control and cooperative beamforming techniques to maximize the minimum weighted average SINR based on statistical channel information, which consists of the covariance matrices in the beamforming network. Since the joint optimization problem over power, transmit beamformer and receive beamformer is non-convex, we analyze two sub-problems: the joint optimization of power and transmit beamformer under fixed receive beamformer, and the joint optimization of power and receive beamformer under fixed transmit beamformer.

Using tools from nonnegative irreducible matrix theory, in particular the Perron-Frobenius Theorem and the Friedland-Karlin inequalities, we provide insights into the structural property of optimal power allocation strategies that maximize sum rates. Our approach is similar to the treatment of linear models in mathematical economies, where interference is viewed in the context of competition. We show that this maximum problem can be restated as a maximization problem of a convex function on a closed convex set. We suggest three algorithms to find the exact and approximate values of the optimal sum rates.

A control-theoretical framework is proposed to optimize the control setting such that throttling can be achieved in a distributed and fair manner. We develop control-theoretic algorithms that (1) are highly adaptive by avoiding the configuration of unnecessary control parameters, (2) provide max-min fairness for any number of throttling routers, (3) respond very quickly to network changes, (4) are extremely robust against extrinsic factors beyond the system control, and (5) are stable under given delay bounds.", "The COVID-19 pandemic brought not only global devastation but also an unprecedented infodemic of false or misleading information that spread rapidly through online social networks.

It also presents wireless network duality and characterizes analytically the power and interference temperature of the primal and dual networks. The relationship between them and the gradients of the spectral radius constraints in the utility maximization problem is established. The utility maximization problem is solved using an optimization technique that can be interpreted as iteratively minimizing the Linterference load in the network. The chapter describes the system model and reformulates our utility maximization problem in the SINR domain with spectral radius constraints.

In this paper, we present an overview of a Perron-Frobenius theoretic framework to overcome the notorious non-convexity barriers in wireless utility maximization problems. Through this approach, the optimal value and solution of the optimization problems can be analytically characterized by the spectral property of matrices induced by nonlinear positive mappings. It also provides a systematic way to derive distributed and fast-convergent algorithms and to evaluate the fairness of resource allocation. This approach can even solve several previously open problems in the wireless networking literature, e.g., Kandukuri and Boyd (TWC 2002), Wiesel, Eldar and Shamai (TSP 2006), Krishnan and Luss (WCNC 2011). More generally, this approach links fundamental\u00a0\u2026", "We study network utility maximization problems in wireless networks for service differentiation that optimize the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Radio (SINR) and reliability under Rayleigh fading. Though seemingly nonconvex, we show that these problems can be solved using an optimization decomposition where each user calculates a payment for a given resource allocation, and the network uses the payment to optimize the performance of the user. We study three important examples of this utility maximization, namely the weighted sum logarithmic SINR maximization, the weighted sum inverse SINR minimization and the weighted sum logarithmic reliability maximization. These problems have hitherto been solved suboptimally in the literature. By exploiting the positivity, quasi-concavity and homogeneity properties in these problems using the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, we propose fixed-point\u00a0\u2026", "In cognitive radio networks, uncontrolled access of secondary users degrades the performance of primary users and can even lead to system infeasibility, as the secondary users are allowed to transmit simultaneously on a shared spectrum. We study the feasibility of the total energy consumption minimization problem subjecting to power budget and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints. Finding the largest set of secondary users (i.e., the system capacity) that can be supported in the system is hard to solve due to the nonconvexity of the cardinality objective. We formulate this problem as a vector-cardinality optimization problem, and propose a convex relaxation that replaces the objective with a continuous and convex function. Motivated by the sum-of-infeasibilities heuristic, a joint power and admission control algorithm is proposed to compute the maximum number of secondary users that can\u00a0\u2026", "DSpace at KOASAS: Optimality Certificate in Dynamic Spectrum Management over DSL \nnetworks KOASAS menu About KOASAS KAIST Library \uac80\uc0c9 Advanced Search Browse \nCommunities & Collections Researchers at KAIST Titles Subject By Date rss_1.0 rss_2.0 \natom_1.0 sherpa SEARCH DSpace at KOASAS College of Engineering(\uacf5\uacfc\ub300\ud559)School of \nElectrical Engineering(\uc804\uae30\ubc0f\uc804\uc790\uacf5\ud559\ubd80)EE-Conference Papers(\ud559\uc220\ud68c\uc758\ub17c\ubb38) Optimality \nCertificate in Dynamic Spectrum Management over DSL networks Cited 0 time in webofscience \nCited 0 time in scopus Hit : 267 Download : 0 Export DC(XML) Excel Tsiaflakis, Paschalis / Tan, \nChee Wei / Yi, Yungresearcher / Chiang, Mung / Moonen, Marc Publisher IEEE Issue Date 2008 \nLanguage ENG Citation IEEE ISIT 2008 URI http://hdl.handle.net/10203/160457 Appears in \nCollection EE-Conference Papers(\ud559\uc220\ud68c\uc758\ub17c\ubb38) Files in This Item There are no files associated \u2026", "This is an overview of the ongoing FAST Copper project, which aims at at substantial improvements in rate, reach, reliability, and quality in copper-last-mile broadband access through fiber/DSL deployment, engineering innovations, and fundamental research.

In our system model, the primary network consisting of n primary nodes, overlaps with the secondary network consisting of m secondary nodes in a unit square. Assume that all nodes move according to an iid mobility model and each primary node serves as a source that multicasts its packets to kp primary destination nodes whereas each secondary source node multicasts its packets to ks secondary destination nodes. Under the cell partitioned network model, we study the capacity and delay for the primary networks under two communication schemes: Non-cooperative Scheme and Cooperative Scheme. The communication pattern considered for the secondary network is Cooperative Scheme. Given that m= n\u03b2 (\u03b2> 1), we show that per-node capacity O (1/kp) 1 and O (1/ks\u00a0\u2026", "Due to the rapid growth of real-time applications and the ubiquity of IEEE 802.11 MAC as a layer-2 protocol for wireless local area networks (WLANs), it is of increasing interest to support delay-based quality of service (QoS) in such WLANs. In this paper, we develop a simple but accurate enough analytical model for predicting queueing delay in non-homogeneous random access based WLANs. This leads to tractable solutions for meeting queueing delay specifications of a number of flows. Using this model, we address the feasibility problem of whether the mean delays required by a set of inelastic flows can be guaranteed in WLANs. Based on the model and feasibility analysis, we further develop an optimization technique to minimize the delays for inelastic flows. Moreover, we present a decentralized algorithm and report its implementation and present extensive simulation and experimental trace-based results to\u00a0\u2026"]}, "collaboration_network": {"target": ["Daniel P.
