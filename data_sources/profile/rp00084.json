Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated\u00a0\u2026", "Most machine-learning methods focus on classifying instances whose classes have already been seen in training. In practice, many applications require classifying instances whose classes have not been seen previously. Zero-shot learning is a powerful and promising learning paradigm, in which the classes covered by training instances and the classes we aim to classify are disjoint. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of zero-shot learning. First of all, we provide an overview of zero-shot learning. According to the data utilized in model optimization, we classify zero-shot learning into three learning settings. Second, we describe different semantic spaces adopted in existing zero-shot learning works. Third, we categorize existing zero-shot learning methods and introduce representative methods under each category. Fourth, we discuss different applications of zero-shot learning. Finally, we highlight\u00a0\u2026", "Geographical characteristics derived from the historical check-in data have been reported effective in improving location recommendation accuracy. However, previous studies mainly exploit geographical characteristics from a user's perspective, via modeling the geographical distribution of each individual user's check-ins. In this paper, we are interested in exploiting geographical characteristics from a location perspective, by modeling the geographical neighborhood of a location. The neighborhood is modeled at two levels: the instance-level neighborhood defined by a few nearest neighbors of the location, and the region-level neighborhood for the geographical region where the location exists. We propose a novel recommendation approach, namely Instance-Region Neighborhood Matrix Factorization (IRenMF), which exploits two levels of geographical neighborhood characteristics: a) instance-level\u00a0\u2026", "Trust is an important concept in human interactions which facilitates the formation and continued existence of functional human societies. In the first decade of the 21st century, computational trust models have been applied to solve many problems in wireless communication systems. This cross-disciplinary research has yielded many innovative solutions. In this paper, we examine the latest methods which have been proposed by researchers to manage trust and reputation in wireless communication systems. Specifically, we survey the state of the art in the application of trust models in the fields of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and cognitive radio networks (CRNs). We classify the mainstream methods into natural categories and illustrate how they complement each other in achieving design goals. Major research directions are also outlined.", "In pharmaceutical sciences, a crucial step of the drug discovery process is the identification of drug-target interactions. However, only a small portion of the drug-target interactions have been experimentally validated, as the experimental validation is laborious and costly. To improve the drug discovery efficiency, there is a great need for the development of accurate computational approaches that can predict potential drug-target interactions to direct the experimental verification. In this paper, we propose a novel drug-target interaction prediction algorithm, namely neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization (NRLMF). Specifically, the proposed NRLMF method focuses on modeling the probability that a drug would interact with a target by logistic matrix factorization, where the properties of drugs and targets are represented by drug-specific and target-specific latent vectors, respectively. Moreover, NRLMF assigns higher importance levels to positive observations (i.e., the observed interacting drug-target pairs) than negative observations (i.e., the unknown pairs). Because the positive observations are already experimentally verified, they are usually more trustworthy. Furthermore, the local structure of the drug-target interaction data has also been exploited via neighborhood regularization to achieve better prediction accuracy. We conducted extensive experiments over four benchmark datasets, and NRLMF demonstrated its effectiveness compared with five state-of-the-art approaches.", "Location-based social networks (LBSNs) offer researchers rich data to study people's online activities and mobility patterns. One important application of such studies is to provide personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendations to enhance user experience in LBSNs. Previous solutions directly predict users' preference on locations but fail to provide insights about users' preference transitions among locations. In this work, we propose a novel category-aware POI recommendation model, which exploits the transition patterns of users' preference over location categories to improve location recommendation accuracy. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) preference transition (over location categories) prediction, and (2) category-aware POI recommendation. Matrix factorization is employed to predict a user's preference transitions over categories and then her preference on locations in the corresponding\u00a0\u2026", "Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the neuronal activities in different brain regions via electrodes. Many existing studies on EEG-based emotion recognition do not fully exploit the topology of EEG channels. In this article, we propose a regularized graph neural network (RGNN) for EEG-based emotion recognition. RGNN considers the biological topology among different brain regions to capture both local and global relations among different EEG channels. Specifically, we model the inter-channel relations in EEG signals via an adjacency matrix in a graph neural network where the connection and sparseness of the adjacency matrix are inspired by neuroscience theories of human brain organization. In addition, we propose two regularizers, namely node-wise domain adversarial training (NodeDAT) and emotion-aware distribution learning (EmotionDL), to better handle cross-subject EEG variations and noisy\u00a0\u2026", "We present the dynamic cognitive network (DCN) which is an extension of the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM). Each concept in the DCNs can have its own value set, depending on how precisely it needs to be described in the network. This enables the DCN to describe the strength of causes and the degree of effects that are crucial to conducting meaningful inferences. The arcs in the DCN define dynamic, causal relationships between concepts. Structurally, DNCs are scalable and more flexible as compared to FCMs. A DCN can be as simple as a cognitive map and FCM, or as complex as a nonlinear dynamic system. To demonstrate the potential applications of DCNs, we present some simulation results. This paper represents our first attempt to develop a dynamic fuzzy inference system using causal relationships. There are many interesting and challenging theoretical and practical issues in DCNs open to further\u00a0\u2026", "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn\u00a0\u2026", "To reduce the air pollution and improve the energy efficiency, many countries and cities (e.g., Singapore) are on the way of introducing electric vehicles (EVs) to replace the vehicles serving in current traffic system. Effective placement of charging stations is essential for the rapid development of EVs, because it is necessary for providing convenience for EVs and ensuring the efficiency of the traffic network. However, existing works mostly concentrate on the mileage anxiety from EV users but ignore their strategic and competitive charging behaviors. To capture the competitive and strategic charging behaviors of the EV users, we consider that an EV user\u2019s charging cost, which is dependent on other EV users\u2019 choices, consists of the travel cost to access the charging station and the queuing cost in charging stations. First, we formulate the Charging Station Placement Problem (CSPP) as a bilevel optimization problem\u00a0\u2026", "In open and dynamic multiagent systems (MASs), agents often need to rely on resources or services provided by other agents to accomplish their goals. During this process, agents are exposed to the risk of being exploited by others. These risks, if not mitigated, can cause serious breakdowns in the operation of MASs and threaten their long-term wellbeing. To protect agents from the uncertainty in the behavior of their interaction partners, the age-old mechanism of trust between human beings is re-contexted into MASs. The basic idea is to let agents self-police the MAS by rating each other on the basis of their observed behavior and basing future interaction decisions on such information. Over the past decade, a large number of trust management models were proposed. However, there is a lack of research effort in several key areas, which are critical to the success of trust management in MASs where human beings\u00a0\u2026", "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly ubiquitous, the topic of AI governance for ethical decision-making by AI has captured public imagination. Within the AI research community, this topic remains less familiar to many researchers. In this paper, we complement existing surveys, which largely focused on the psychological, social and legal discussions of the topic, with an analysis of recent advances in technical solutions for AI governance. By reviewing publications in leading AI conferences including AAAI, AAMAS, ECAI and IJCAI, we propose a taxonomy which divides the field into four areas: 1) exploring ethical dilemmas; 2) individual ethical decision frameworks; 3) collective ethical decision frameworks; and 4) ethics in human-AI interactions. We highlight the intuitions and key techniques used in each approach, and discuss promising future research directions towards successful integration of ethical AI systems into human societies.", "Dubbed \u201cthe successor to the mobile Internet,\u201d the concept of the Metaverse has grown in popularity. While there exist lite versions of the Metaverse today, they are still far from realizing the full vision of an immersive, embodied, and interoperable Metaverse. Without addressing the issues of implementation from the communication and networking, as well as computation perspectives, the Metaverse is difficult to succeed the Internet, especially in terms of its accessibility to billions of users today. In this survey, we focus on the edge-enabled Metaverse to realize its ultimate vision. We first provide readers with a succinct tutorial of the Metaverse, an introduction to the architecture, as well as current developments. To enable ubiquitous, seamless, and embodied access to the Metaverse, we discuss the communication and networking challenges and survey cutting-edge solutions and concepts that leverage next\u00a0\u2026", "Messages in human conversations inherently convey emotions. The task of detecting emotions in textual conversations leads to a wide range of applications such as opinion mining in social networks. However, enabling machines to analyze emotions in conversations is challenging, partly because humans often rely on the context and commonsense knowledge to express emotions. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a Knowledge-Enriched Transformer (KET), where contextual utterances are interpreted using hierarchical self-attention and external commonsense knowledge is dynamically leveraged using a context-aware affective graph attention mechanism. Experiments on multiple textual conversation datasets demonstrate that both context and commonsense knowledge are consistently beneficial to the emotion detection performance. In addition, the experimental results show that our KET model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on most of the tested datasets in F1 score.", "Recent years have witnessed extensive studies on distance metric learning (DML) for improving similarity search in multimedia information retrieval tasks. Despite their successes, most existing DML methods suffer from two critical limitations: (i) they typically attempt to learn a linear distance function on the input feature space, in which the assumption of linearity limits their capacity of measuring the similarity on complex patterns in real-world applications; (ii) they are often designed for learning distance metrics on uni-modal data, which may not effectively handle the similarity measures for multimedia objects with multimodal representations. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of online multimodal deep similarity learning (OMDSL), which aims to optimally integrate multiple deep neural networks pretrained with stacked denoising autoencoder. In particular, the proposed\u00a0\u2026", "Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between\u00a0\u2026", "Dropout prediction research in MOOCs aims to predict whether students will drop out from the courses instead of completing them. Due to the high dropout rates in current MOOCs, this problem is of great importance. Current methods rely on features extracted by feature engineering, in which all features are extracted manually. This process is costly, time consuming, and not extensible to new datasets from different platforms or different courses with different characters. In this paper, we propose a model that can automatically extract features from the raw MOOC data. Our model is a deep neural network, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on a public dataset, we show that the proposed model can achieve results comparable to feature engineering based methods.", "Corporate credit ratings are one of the key problems of the credit risk management, which has attracted much research attention since the credit crisis in 2007. Scorecards are the most widely used approaches for corporate credit ratings nowadays. However, they have heavy dependency on the involvement of users. AI technologies, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance on automatic corporate credit ratings. Corporate credit ratings involve various rating models, and their outputs can scale to multiple levels and be used for various applications. Such inherent complexity gives rise to the requirement of higher demands on the effectiveness of learning algorithms regarding the accuracy, overfitness, error distribution, and output distribution. Most research works show that SVMs have better performance than ANNs on accuracy\u00a0\u2026", "We propose a causal framework to explain the catastrophic forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) and then derive a novel distillation method that is orthogonal to the existing anti-forgetting techniques, such as data replay and feature/label distillation. We first 1) place CIL into the framework, 2) answer why the forgetting happens: the causal effect of the old data is lost in new training, and then 3) explain how the existing techniques mitigate it: they bring the causal effect back. Based on the causal framework, we propose to distill the Colliding Effect between the old and the new data, which is fundamentally equivalent to the causal effect of data replay, but without any cost of replay storage. Thanks to the causal effect analysis, we can further capture the Incremental Momentum Effect of the data stream, removing which can help to retain the old effect overwhelmed by the new data effect, and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class in testing. Extensive experiments on three CIL benchmarks: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Sub&Full, show that the proposed causal effect distillation can improve various state-of-the-art CIL methods by a large margin (0.72%-9.06%)", "In recent years, the enhanced sensing and computation capabilities of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have opened the doors to several mobile crowdsensing applications. In mobile crowdsensing, a model owner announces a sensing task following which interested workers collect the required data. However, in some cases, a model owner may have insufficient data samples to build an effective machine learning model. To this end, we propose a federated learning (FL)-based privacy-preserving approach to facilitate collaborative machine learning among multiple model owners in mobile crowdsensing. Our system model allows collaborative machine learning without compromising data privacy given that only the model parameters instead of the raw data are exchanged within the federation. However, there are two main challenges of incentive mismatches between workers and model owners, as well as among\u00a0\u2026", "To enable the large scale and efficient deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the confluence of AI and Edge Computing has given rise to Edge Intelligence, which leverages on the computation and communication capabilities of end devices and edge servers to process data closer to where it is produced. One of the enabling technologies of Edge Intelligence is the privacy preserving machine learning paradigm known as Federated Learning (FL), which enables data owners to conduct model training without having to transmit their raw data to third-party servers. However, the FL network is envisioned to involve thousands of heterogeneous distributed devices. As a result, communication inefficiency remains a key bottleneck. To reduce node failures and device dropouts, the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework has been proposed whereby cluster heads are designated to support the data owners\u00a0\u2026", "Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising concept for improving the utilization of scarce radio spectrum resources. A reliable strategy for the detection of unused spectrum bands is essential to the design and practical implementation of CR systems. It is widely accepted that in a real-world environment, cooperative spectrum sensing involving many secondary users scattered in a wide geographical area can greatly improve sensing accuracy. However, some secondary users may misbehave, i.e. provide false sensing information, in an attempt to maximize their own utility gains. Such selfish behaviour, if unchecked, can severely impact the operation of the CR system. In this paper, we propose a novel trustaware hybrid spectrum sensing scheme which can detect misbehaving secondary users and filter out their reported spectrum sensing results from the decision making process.

Moreover, the birth of the Metaverse comes amid growing privacy concerns among users. In this article, we begin by providing a preliminary definition of the Metaverse. We discuss the architecture of the Metaverse and mainly focus on motivating the convergence of edge intelligence and the infrastructure layer of the Metaverse.

This paper presents a general image translation framework that incorporates optimal transport for feature alignment between conditional inputs and style exemplars in translation. The introduction of optimal transport mitigates the constraint of many-to-one feature matching significantly while building up semantic correspondences between conditional inputs and exemplars. We design a novel unbalanced optimal transport to address the transport between features with deviational distributions which exists widely between conditional inputs and exemplars. In addition, we design a semantic-aware normalization scheme that injects style and semantic features of exemplars into the image translation process successfully. Extensive experiments over multiple image translation tasks show that our proposed technique achieves superior image translation qualitatively and quantitatively as compared with the state-of-the-art.", "The fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) has gradually emerged as a powerful paradigm for knowledge representation and a simulation mechanism that is applicable to numerous research and application fields. However, since efficient methods to determine the states of the investigated system and to quantify causalities that are the very foundations of FCM theory are lacking, constructing FCMs for complex causal systems greatly depends on expert knowledge. The manually developed models have a substantial shortcoming due to the model subjectivity and difficulties with assessing its reliability. In this paper, we proposed a fuzzy neural network to enhance the learning ability of FCMs. Our approach incorporates the inference mechanism of conventional FCMs with the determination of membership functions, as well as the quantification of causalities. In this manner, FCM models of the investigated systems can\u00a0\u2026", "With1 the rapid growth of the internet of things (IoT) market and requirement, low power wide area (LPWA) technologies have become popular.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating blockchain technology and LoRaWAN IoT technology.", "Word embedding maps words into a low-dimensional continuous embedding space by exploiting the local word collocation patterns in a small context window. On the other hand, topic modeling maps documents onto a low-dimensional topic space, by utilizing the global word collocation patterns in the same document. These two types of patterns are complementary. In this paper, we propose a generative topic embedding model to combine the two types of patterns. In our model, topics are represented by embedding vectors, and are shared across documents. The probability of each word is influenced by both its local context and its topic. A variational inference method yields the topic embeddings as well as the topic mixing proportions for each document. Jointly they represent the document in a low-dimensional continuous space. In two document classification tasks, our method performs better than eight existing methods, with fewer features. In addition, we illustrate with an example that our method can generate coherent topics even based on only one document.", "Due to air quality significantly affects human health, it is becoming increasingly important to accurately and timely predict the air quality index (AQI). To this end, this article proposes a new federated learning (FL)-based aerial-ground air quality sensing framework for fine-grained 3-D air quality monitoring and forecasting. Specifically, in the air, this framework leverages a lightweight Dense-MobileNet model to achieve energy-efficient end-to-end learning from haze features of haze images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for predicting AQI scale distribution. Furthermore, the FL framework not only allows various organizations or institutions to collaboratively learn a well-trained global model to monitor AQI without compromising privacy but also expands the scope of UAV swarms monitoring.

Our method is applicable to both supervised and semi-supervised settings. For the supervised settings, we conduct extensive experiments on named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging and end-to-end target based sentiment analysis (E2E-TBSA) tasks. For the semi-supervised settings, we evaluate our method on the NER task under the conditions of given unlabeled data only and unlabeled data plus a knowledge base. The results show that our method can consistently outperform the baselines, particularly when the given gold training data are less.", "Web applications are mostly designed with multiple tiers for flexibility and software reusability. It is difficult to model the behavior of multi-tier Web applications due to the fact that the workload is dynamic and unpredictable and the resource demand in each tier is different. Those features also cause the task of resource allocation for multi-tier Web applications very challenging. In order to meet service level agreements (SLAs) with minimal resource costs, Web service providers should dynamically allocate appropriate resources to each tier. This is particularly important to minimize the monetary cost in the pay-as-you-go cloud computing environments.

However, due to defects in expression and architecture, the traditional FCMs and most of their relevant extensions are not applicable to classification problems. To solve this problem, this paper presents an approach that directly extends the model by translating the reasoning mechanism of traditional FCMs to a set of fuzzy if\u2013 then rules. Moreover, the proposed approach fully considers the contribution of the inputs to the activation of the fuzzy rules and quantifies the causalities using mutual subsethood, which works in conjunction with volume defuzzification in a gradient descent-learning framework. In this manner, our approach enhances the capability of the conventional FCMs to automatically identify membership\u00a0\u2026", "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) represent a form of large-scale learning that is changing the landscape of higher education. In this paper, we offer a perspective on how advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may enhance learning and research on MOOCs. We focus on emerging AI techniques including how knowledge representation tools can enable students to adjust the sequence of learning to fit their own needs; how optimization techniques can efficiently match community teaching assistants to MOOC mediation tasks to offer personal attention to learners; and how virtual learning companions with human traits such as curiosity and emotions can enhance learning experience on a large scale. These new capabilities will also bring opportunities for educational researchers to analyse students\u2019 learning skills and uncover points along learning paths where students with different backgrounds may require\u00a0\u2026", "Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the\u00a0\u2026", "Image inpainting is an underdetermined inverse problem, which naturally allows diverse contents to fill up the missing or corrupted regions realistically. Prevalent approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can synthesize visually pleasant contents, but CNNs suffer from limited perception fields for capturing global features. With image-level attention, transformers enable to model long-range dependencies and generate diverse contents with autoregressive modeling of pixel-sequence distributions. However, the unidirectional attention in autoregressive transformers is suboptimal as corrupted image regions may have arbitrary shapes with contexts from any direction. We propose BAT-Fill, an innovative image inpainting framework that introduces a novel bidirectional autoregressive transformer (BAT) for image inpainting. BAT utilizes the transformers to learn autoregressive distributions, which naturally\u00a0\u2026", "Distance metric learning (DML) is an important technique to improve similarity search in content-based image retrieval. Despite being studied extensively, most existing DML approaches typically adopt a single-modal learning framework that learns the distance metric on either a single feature type or a combined feature space where multiple types of features are simply concatenated. Such single-modal DML methods suffer from some critical limitations: (i) some type of features may significantly dominate the others in the DML task due to diverse feature representations; and (ii) learning a distance metric on the combined high-dimensional feature space can be extremely time-consuming using the naive feature concatenation approach. To address these limitations, in this paper, we investigate a novel scheme of online multi-modal distance metric learning (OMDML), which explores a unified two-level online learning\u00a0\u2026", "Reputation systems have become more and more important in facilitating transactions in online systems. However, the accuracy of reputation systems has always been a concern for the users due to the existence of unfair ratings. Though many approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of unfair ratings, most of them use the credibility of the rating provider alone to decide whether the rating is unfair without considering other aspects of the rating itself. Models that do consider multiple aspects often combine them through arbitrarily set weights. Therefore, they cannot work well when the credibility is not evaluated accurately or when the weights are not set properly. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a reputation model which considers and combines the temporal, similarity and quantity aspects of the user ratings based on fuzzy logic to improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation. Experimental results based on a set of real user data from a cyber competition show that the proposed model is more robust against unfair ratings than the existing approaches, especially under Sybil attack conditions.", "How to mitigate the influence of unfair testimonies remains an open issue in the research of rating systems. Methods have been proposed to filter the unfair testimonies in order to mitigate the influence of unfair testimonies. However, existing methods depend on assumptions that ratings follow a particular distribution to carry out the testimony filtering. This constrains them in specific rating systems and hinders their applications in other reputation systems. Moreover, existing methods do not scale well with the increase of testimony number due to their iterative nature. In this paper, a novel entropy-based method is proposed to measure the testimony quality, based on which unfair testimonies are further filtered. The proposed method does not require the assumption regarding the rating distribution. Moreover, it scales linearly with the increase of the testimony number. Experimental results show that the proposed method\u00a0\u2026", "Crowd sourcing (CS) systems offer a new way for businesses and individuals to leverage on the power of mass collaboration to accomplish complex tasks in a divide-and-conquer manner. In existing CS systems, no facility has been provided for analyzing the trustworthiness of workers and providing decision support for allocating tasks to workers, which leads to high dependency of the quality of work on the behavior of workers in CS systems as shown in this paper. To address this problem, trust management mechanisms are urgently needed. Traditional trust management techniques are focused on identifying the most trustworthy service providers (SPs) as accurately as possible. Little thoughts were given to the question of how to utilize these SPs due to two common assumptions: 1) an SP can serve an unlimited number of requests in one time unit, and 2) a service consumer (SC) only needs to select one SP for\u00a0\u2026", "Cognitive maps (CMs), fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), and dynamical cognitive networks (DCNs) are related tools for modeling the cognition of human beings and facilitating machine inferences accordingly. FCMs extend CMs, and DCNs extend FCMs. Domain experts often face the challenge that CMs/FCMs are not sufficiently capable in many applications and that DCNs are too complex. This paper presents a simplified DCN (sDCN) that extends the modeling capability of FCM/CM, yet maintains simplicity. Additionally, this paper proves that there exists a theoretical equivalence among models in the cognitive map family of CMs, FCMs, and sDCNs. It shows that every sDCN can be represented by an FCM or a CM, and  vice versa ; similarly, every FCM can be represented by a CM, and  vice versa . The result shows that CMs, FCMs, and sDCNs are a family of cognitive models that differs from many extended models\u00a0\u2026", "Empathetic conversational models have been shown to improve user satisfaction and task outcomes in numerous domains. In Psychology, persona has been shown to be highly correlated to personality, which in turn influences empathy. In addition, our empirical analysis also suggests that persona plays an important role in empathetic conversations. To this end, we propose a new task towards persona-based empathetic conversations and present the first empirical study on the impact of persona on empathetic responding. Specifically, we first present a novel large-scale multi-domain dataset for persona-based empathetic conversations. We then propose CoBERT, an efficient BERT-based response selection model that obtains the state-of-the-art performance on our dataset. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the impact of persona on empathetic responding. Notably, our results show that persona improves empathetic responding more when CoBERT is trained on empathetic conversations than non-empathetic ones, establishing an empirical link between persona and empathy in human conversations.", "Real-world visual recognition requires handling the extreme sample imbalance in large-scale long-tailed data. We propose a\" divide&conquer\" strategy for the challenging LVIS task: divide the whole data into balanced parts and then apply incremental learning to conquer each one. This derives a novel learning paradigm: class-incremental few-shot learning, which is especially effective for the challenge evolving over time: 1) the class imbalance among the old class knowledge review and 2) the few-shot data in new-class learning. We call our approach Learning to Segment the Tail (LST). In particular, we design an instance-level balanced replay scheme, which is a memory-efficient approximation to balance the instance-level samples from the old-class images. We also propose to use a meta-module for new-class learning, where the module parameters are shared across incremental phases, gaining the learning-to-learn knowledge incrementally, from the data-rich head to the data-poor tail. We empirically show that: at the expense of a little sacrifice of head-class forgetting, we can gain a significant 8.3% AP improvement for the tail classes with less than 10 instances, achieving an overall 2.0% AP boost for the whole 1,230 classes.", "Diabetes mellitus, known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders and has affected hundreds of millions of people. The detection of diabetes is of great importance, concerning its severe complications. There have been plenty of research studies about diabetes identification, many of which are based on the Pima Indian diabetes data set. It's a data set studying women in Pima Indian population started from 1965, where the onset rate for diabetes is comparatively high. Most of the research studies done before mainly focused on one or two particular complex technique to test the data, while a comprehensive research over many common techniques is missing. In this paper, we make a comprehensive exploration to the most popular techniques (e.g. DNN (Deep Neural Network), SVM (Support Vector Machine), etc.) used to identify diabetes and data preprocessing methods. Basically, we examine these\u00a0\u2026", "A robust training algorithm for a class of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) with linear nodes and an input tapped-delay-line memory is developed in this paper. It is seen that, in order to remove the effects of the input disturbances and reduce both the structural and empirical risks of the SLFN, the input weights of the SLFN are assigned such that the hidden layer of the SLFN performs as a pre-processor, and the output weights are then trained to minimize the weighted sum of the output error squares as well as the weighted sum of the output weight squares. The performance of an SLFN-based signal classifier trained with the proposed robust algorithm is studied in the simulation section to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the new scheme.", "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. However, communication inefficiency remains the key bottleneck that impedes its large-scale implementation. Recently, hierarchical FL (HFL) has been proposed in which data owners, i.e., workers, can first transmit their updated model parameters to edge servers for intermediate aggregation. This reduces the instances of global communication and straggling workers. To enable efficient HFL, it is important to address the issues of edge association and resource allocation in the context of non-cooperative players, i.e., workers, edge servers, and model owner. However, the existing studies merely focus on static approaches and do not consider the dynamic interactions and bounded rationalities of the players. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical game framework to study the dynamics of edge association and\u00a0\u2026", "Mobile/spatial crowdsourcing is a class of crowdsourcing applications in which workers travel to specific locations in order to perform tasks. As workers may possess different levels of competence, a major research challenge for spatial crowdsourcing is to control the quality of the results obtained. Although existing mobile crowdsourcing systems are able to track a wide range of performance related data for the participating workers, there still lacks an automated mechanism to help requesters make key task allocation decisions including: 1) to whom should a task to allocated; 2) how much to pay for the result provided by each worker; and 3) when to stop looking for additional workers for a task. In this paper, we propose a budget-aware task allocation approach for spatial crowdsourcing (Budget-TASC) to help requesters make these three decisions jointly. It considers the workers' reputation and proximity to the task\u00a0\u2026", "The problem of unfair testimonies has to be addressed effectively to improve the robustness of reputation systems. We propose an integrated CLUstering-Based approach called iCLUB to filter unfair testimonies for reputation systems using multi-nominal testimonies, in multiagent-based electronic commerce. It adopts clustering and considers buying agents\u2019 local and global knowledge about selling agents. Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results of our approach in filtering various types of unfair testimonies.", "Despite its success, similarity-based collaborative filtering suffers from some significant limitations, such as scalability and sparsity. This paper introduces trust to the domain of collaborative filtering to overcome these limitations. Compared with the similarity-based CF, introduction of trust does improve the performance of CF in terms of coverage, prediction accuracy, and robustness in the presence of attacks. Experimental results based on a real dataset are illustrated as evidences to support our claim.", "Affect conveys important implicit information in human communication. Having the capability to correctly express affect during human-machine conversations is one of the major milestones in artificial intelligence. In recent years, extensive research on open-domain neural conversational models has been conducted. However, embedding affect into such models is still under explored. In this paper, we propose an endto-end affect-rich open-domain neural conversational model that produces responses not only appropriate in syntax and semantics, but also with rich affect. Our model extends the Seq2Seq model and adopts VAD (Valence, Arousal and Dominance) affective notations to embed each word with affects. In addition, our model considers the effect of negators and intensifiers via a novel affective attention mechanism, which biases attention towards affect-rich words in input sentences. Lastly, we train our model with an affect-incorporated objective function to encourage the generation of affect-rich words in the output responses. Evaluations based on both perplexity and human evaluations show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline model of comparable size in producing natural and affect-rich responses.", "Rapid population aging and advances in sensing technologies motivate the development of unobtrusive healthcare systems, designed to unobtrusively collect an elderly\u2019s personalized information of daily living and help him actively enjoy a healthy lifestyle. Existing studies towards this goal typically focus on recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs) and abnormal behavior detection. However, the applicability of these approaches is often limited by an offline analysis strategy, complex parameter tuning, obtrusive data collection, and a need for training data. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a novel framework, named the online daily habit modeling and anomaly detection (ODHMAD) model, for the real-time personalized ADL recognition, habit modeling, and anomaly detection for the solitary elderly. In contrast to most existing studies which consider activity recognition and abnormal\u00a0\u2026", "With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses solely on a high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and the meaning of information into data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons for SemCom in 6G. Then, we provide an overview of SemCom-related theory development. After that, we introduce three types of SemCom, i.e., semantic-oriented\u00a0\u2026", "The Metaverse is regarded as the next-generation Internet paradigm that allows humans to play, work, and socialize in an alternative virtual world with an immersive experience, for instance, via head-mounted displays for Virtual Reality (VR) rendering. With the help of ubiquitous wireless connections and powerful edge computing technologies, VR users in the wireless edge-empowered Metaverse can immerse themselves in the virtual through the access of VR services offered by different providers. However, VR applications are computation- and communication-intensive. The VR service providers (SPs) have to optimize the VR service delivery efficiently and economically given their limited communication and computation resources. An incentive mechanism can be thus applied as an effective tool for managing VR services between providers and users. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a learning-based\u00a0\u2026", "Recently Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been attracting attentions for its simple and fast training algorithm, which randomly selects input weights. Given sufficient hidden neurons, ELM has a comparable performance for a wide range of regression and classification problems. However, in this paper we argue that random input weight selection may lead to an ill-conditioned problem, for which solutions will be numerically unstable. In order to improve the conditioning of ELM, we propose an input weight selection algorithm for an ELM with linear hidden neurons. Experiment results show that by applying the proposed algorithm accuracy is maintained while condition is perfectly stable.", "Many automated negotiation models have been developed to solve the conflict in many distributed computational systems. However, the problem of finding win\u2013win outcome in multiattribute negotiation has not been tackled well. To address this issue, based on an evolutionary method of multiobjective optimization, this paper presents a negotiation model that can find win\u2013win solutions of multiple attributes, but needs not to reveal negotiating agents\u2019 private utility functions to their opponents or a third\u2010party mediator. Moreover, we also equip our agents with a general type of utility functions of interdependent multiattributes, which captures human intuitions well. In addition, we also develop a novel time\u2010dependent concession strategy model, which can help both sides find a final agreement among a set of win\u2013win ones. Finally, lots of experiments confirm that our negotiation model outperforms the existing models\u00a0\u2026", "The density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm was designed to identify arbitrary-shaped clusters by finding density peaks in the underlying dataset. Due to its aptitudes of relatively low computational complexity and a small number of control parameters in use, DPC soon became widely adopted. However, because DPC takes the entire data space into consideration during the computation of local density, which is then used to generate a decision graph for the identification of cluster centroids, DPC may face difficulty in differentiating overlapping clusters and in dealing with low-density data points. In this paper, we propose a residual error-based density peak clustering algorithm named REDPC to better handle datasets comprising various data distribution patterns. Specifically, REDPC adopts the residual error computation to measure the local density within a neighbourhood region. As such, comparing to DPC, our\u00a0\u2026", "In this work, we focus on modeling user-generated review and overall rating pairs, and aim to identify semantic aspects and aspect-level sentiments from review data as well as to predict overall sentiments of reviews. We propose a novel probabilistic supervised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM) to deal with the problems in one go under a unified framework. SJASM represents each review document in the form of opinion pairs, and can simultaneously model aspect terms and corresponding opinion words of the review for hidden aspect and sentiment detection. It also leverages sentimental overall ratings, which often come with online reviews, as supervision data, and can infer the semantic aspects and aspect-level sentiments that are not only meaningful but also predictive of overall sentiments of reviews. Moreover, we also develop efficient inference method for parameter estimation of SJASM based on\u00a0\u2026", "As a powerful paradigm for knowledge representation and a simulation mechanism applicable to numerous research and application fields, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have attracted a great deal of attention from various research communities. However, the traditional FCMs do not provide efficient methods to determine the states of the investigated system and to quantify causalities which are the very foundation of the FCM theory. Therefore in many cases, constructing FCMs for complex causal systems greatly depends on expert knowledge. The manually developed models have a substantial shortcoming due to model subjectivity and difficulties with accessing its reliability. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy neural network to enhance the learning ability of FCMs so that the automatic determination of membership functions and quantification of causalities can be incorporated with the inference mechanism of\u00a0\u2026", "Crowdsensing of air quality is a useful way to improve public awareness and supplement local air quality monitoring data. However, current air quality monitoring approaches are either too sophisticated, costly or bulky to be used effectively by the mass. In this paper, we describe AirTick, a mobile app that can turn any camera enabled smart mobile device into an air quality sensor, thereby enabling crowdsensing of air quality. AirTick leverages image analytics and deep learning techniques to produce accurate estimates of air quality following the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI). We report the results of an initial experimental and empirical evaluations of AirTick. The AirTick tool has been shown to achieve, on average, 87% accuracy in day time operation and 75% accuracy in night time operation. Feedbacks from 100 test users indicate that they perceive AirTick to be highly useful and easy to use. Our results provide a strong positive case for the benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques for convenient and scalable crowdsensing of air quality.", "A crowdsourcing system is a useful platform for utilizing the intelligence and skills of the mass. Nevertheless, like any open system that involves the exchange of things of value, selfish and malicious behaviors exist in crowdsourcing systems and need to be mitigated. Trust management has been proven to be a viable solution in many systems. However, a major difference between crowdsourcing systems and existing trust models designed for multi-agent systems is that human trustees have limited task processing capacity per unit time compared to an intelligent agent program. This paper recognizes a problem in current trust-aware decision-making methods for task assignment in crowdsourcing platforms. On the one hand, trust-based methods over-assign tasks to trusted workers, while on the other hand, workload-based solutions do not give sufficient guarantees on the quality of work. The proposed solution, the social welfare optimizing reputation-aware decision-making (SWORD) approach, strikes a balance between the two and is shown through extensive simulations to significantly improve social welfare of crowdsourcing platforms compared to related work.", "Metaverse, also known as the Internet of 3-D worlds, has recently attracted much attention from both academia and industry. Each virtual subworld, operated by a virtual service provider (VSP), provides a type of virtual service. Digital twins (DTs), namely, digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. Generally, a DT belongs to the party that develops it and establishes the communication link between the two worlds. However, in an interoperable metaverse, data-like DTs can be \u201cshared\u201d within the platform. Therefore, one set of DTs can be leveraged by multiple VSPs. As the quality of the shared DTs may not always be satisfying, in this article, we propose an agile solution, i.e., a dynamic hierarchical framework, in which a group of Internet of Things devices in the lower level are incentivized to collectively sense physical objects\u2019 status information and VSPs in the upper level determine synchronization\u00a0\u2026", "Automated negotiation is widely applied in various domains. However, the development of such systems is a complex knowledge and software engineering task. So, a methodology there will be helpful. Unfortunately, none of existing methodologies can offer sufficient, detailed support for such system development. To remove this limitation, this paper develops a new methodology made up of (1) a generic framework (architectural pattern) for the main task, and (2) a library of modular and reusable design pattern (templates) of subtasks. Thus, it is much easier to build a negotiating agent by assembling these standardized components rather than reinventing the wheel each time. Moreover, because these patterns are identified from a wide variety of existing negotiating agents (especially high impact ones), they can also improve the quality of the final systems developed.

Wireless energy transfer technique can recharge the UAV when the system is in operation, assisting the UAV to continuously collect and deliver data. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model to describe the energy and data transfer optimization problem for the UAV. To maximize the long-term utility of the UAV, the MDP model is solved by value iteration algorithm to obtain the optimal strategies of the UAV to collect data, deliver data, and receive transferred energy to replenish on-device battery energy storage\u00a0\u2026", "Recent advances in wireless communications and sensor technologies have enabled the development of low-cost wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for a wide range of applications.

We then review representative MAC protocols from the following four categories: contention-based protocols, contention-free (scheduled-based) protocols, hybrid protocols, and preamble sampling protocols.

Specifically, for each user, a generator recommends a set of diverse and relevant items by sequentially sampling from a personalized Determinantal Point Process (DPP) kernel matrix. This kernel matrix is constructed by two learnable components: the general co-occurrence of diverse items and the user\u2019s personal preference to items. To learn the first component, we propose a novel pairwise learning paradigm using training pairs, and each training pair consists of a set of diverse items and a set of similar items randomly sampled from the observed data of all users. The second component is learnt through adversarial training against a discriminator which strives to distinguish between recommended items and the ground-truth sets randomly sampled from the observed data of the target user. Experimental results show that PD-GAN is superior to generate recommendations that are both diverse and relevant.", "A major research challenge for spatial crowdsourcing is to improve the expected quality of the results. However, existing research in this field mostly focuses on achieving this objective in volunteer-based spatial crowdsourcing. In this paper, we introduce the budget limitations into the above problem and consider realistic cases where workers are paid unequally based on their trustworthiness.

The prevalent approaches adopt a hybrid objective of reconstruction and perceptual quality by using generative adversarial networks. However, the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss focus on synthesizing contents of different frequencies and simply applying them together often leads to inter-frequency conflicts and compromised inpainting. This paper presents WaveFill, a wavelet-based inpainting network that decomposes images into multiple frequency bands and fills the missing regions in each frequency band separately and explicitly. WaveFill decomposes images by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that preserves spatial information naturally. It applies L1 reconstruction loss to the decomposed low-frequency bands and adversarial loss to high-frequency bands, hence effectively mitigate inter-frequency conflicts while completing images in spatial domain. To address the inpainting inconsistency in different frequency bands and fuse features with distinct statistics, we design a novel normalization scheme that aligns and fuses the multi-frequency features effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets show that WaveFill achieves superior image inpainting qualitatively and quantitatively.", "Causal feature selection has achieved much attention in recent years, which discovers a Markov boundary (MB) of the class attribute. The MB of the class attribute implies local causal relations between the class attribute and the features, thus leading to more interpretable and robust prediction models than the features selected by the traditional feature selection algorithms. Many causal feature selection methods have been proposed, and almost all of them employ conditional independence (CI) tests to identify MBs. However, many datasets from real-world applications may suffer from incorrect CI tests due to noise or small-sized samples, resulting in lower MB discovery accuracy for these existing algorithms. To tackle this issue, in this article, we first introduce a new concept of PCMasking to explain a type of incorrect CI tests in the MB discovery, then propose a cross-check and complement MB discovery (CCMB\u00a0\u2026", "Many recommendation tasks are formulated as top-N item recommendation problems based on users\u2019 implicit feedback instead of explicit feedback. Here explicit feedback refers to users\u2019 ratings to items while implicit feedback is derived from users\u2019 interactions with items, eg, number of times a user plays a song. In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm named AdaBPR (Adaptive Boosting Personalized Ranking) for top-N item recommendation using users\u2019 implicit feedback. In the proposed framework, multiple homogeneous component recommenders are linearly combined to create an ensemble model, for better recommendation accuracy. The component recommenders are constructed based on a fixed collaborative filtering algorithm by using a re-weighting strategy, which assigns a dynamic weight distribution on the observed user-item interactions. AdaBPR demonstrates its effectiveness on three datasets compared with strong baseline algorithms.", "Agile methodologies use user stories to capture software requirements. This often results in team members over emphasizing their understanding of the goals, without proper incorporation of goals from other stakeholders or customers. Existing UML or other goal oriented modeling methods tend to be overly complex for non-technical stakeholders to properly express their goals and communicate them to the agile team. In this paper, we propose a light weight Goal Net based method to model goal requirements in agile software development process to address this problem. It can be used to decompose complex processes into phased goals, and model low level user stories to high level hierarchy goal structures. Our preliminary analysis and studies in educational software engineering contexts show that it can improve agile team's group awareness to project goals and, thus, improve team productivity and artifact\u00a0\u2026", "Reputation-based approaches allow a crowdsourcing system to identify reliable workers to whom tasks can be delegated. In crowdsourcing systems that can be modeled as multi-agent trust networks consist of resource constrained trustee agents (ie, workers), workers may need to further sub-delegate tasks to others if they determine that they cannot complete all pending tasks before the stipulated deadlines. Existing reputation-based decision-making models cannot help workers decide when and to whom to sub-delegate tasks. In this paper, we proposed a reputation aware task sub-delegation (RTS) approach to bridge this gap. By jointly considering a worker's reputation, workload, the price of its effort and its trust relationships with others, RTS can be implemented as an intelligent agent to help workers make sub-delegation decisions in a distributed manner. The resulting task allocation maximizes social welfare through efficient utilization of the collective capacity of a crowd, and provides provable performance guarantees. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches based on the Epinions trust network demonstrate significant advantages of RTS under high workload conditions.", "Trust is an important mechanism enabling agents to self-police open and dynamic multi-agent systems (ODMASs). Trusters evaluate the reputation of trustees based on their past observed performance, and use this information to guide their future interaction decisions. Existing trust models tend to concentrate trusters\u2019 interactions on a small number of highly reputable trustees to minimize risk exposure. When a trustee\u2019s servicing capacity is limited, such an approach may cause long delays for trusters and subsequently damage the reputation of trustees. To mitigate this problem, we propose a reputation management approach for trustee agents based on distributed constraint optimization. It helps a trustee to make situation-aware decisions on which incoming requests to serve and prevent the resulting reputation score from being affected by factors out of the trustee\u2019s control. The approach is evaluated through theoretical analysis and within a simulated, highly dynamic multi-agent environment. The results show that it can achieve close to optimally efficient utilization of the trustee agents\u2019 collective capacity in an ODMAS, promotes fair treatment of trustee agents based on their behavior, and significantly outperforms related work in enhancing social welfare.", "Nowadays, with the rapid growth of microblogging networks for news propagation, there are increasingly more people accessing news through such emerging social media. In the meantime, fake news now spreads at a faster pace and affects a larger population than ever before. Compared with traditional text news, the news posted on microblog often has attached images in the context. So how to correctly and autonomously detect fakes news in a multi-modal manner becomes a prominent challenge to be addressed. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model, named BERT-based domain adaptation neural network for multi-modal fake news detection (BDANN). BDANN comprises three main modules: a multi-modal feature extractor, a domain classifier and a fake news detector. Specifically, the multi-modal feature extractor employs the pretrained BERT model to extract text features and the pretrained VGG-19\u00a0\u2026", "Increasingly, developers are creating serious games to enhance user experiences in education and training. To bridge the gap between game experiences in the virtual environment and in real life, it's crucial to generate believable characters and contexts in real time. However, numerous variables must be simulated for a large-scale serious game. These variables are involved in complex causal relationships, and their values change over time. Because conventional models haven't addressed world modeling well, researchers created the Evolutionary Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM) to model the characters' variables and contexts with the causalities among them in serious games. As an extension of FCM, E-FCM models not only fuzzy causal relationships but also probabilistic causal relationships among the variables. It also allows asynchronous updates of the variables, so that they can evolve dynamically and\u00a0\u2026", "Literature in psychology has shown that curiosity is the intrinsic motivation for exploration, learning, and creativity. Various forms of computational curiosity have been developed to provide artificial beings with desirable functions, such as detecting and adapting to novel inputs, making decisions related to aesthetics, and achieving pedagogical purposes. This article reviews existing models of computational curiosity in light of psychological theories that are beneficial to building models of human cognition and designing human-like agents. We first study theories in psychology to shed light on the underpinnings of human curiosity, where a two-step process is proposed to serve as a general model for analyzing curiosity. Subsequently, existing models of computational curiosity are reviewed under the proposed framework.

To achieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the key technology. However, computing intensive tasks of real-time rendering from metaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a single resource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile devices can offload the metaverse rendering tasks to other mobile devices by adopting the collaborative computing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC). Therefore, this paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework for the metaverse services, especially for vehicular metaverse. In the framework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated to handle intensive computation tasks in the vehicular metaverse\u00a0\u2026", "Over the years, government service provision in China has been plagued by inefficiencies. Previous attempts to address this challenge following a toolbox e-government system model in China were not effective. In this paper, we report on a successful experience in improving government service provision in the domain of social insurance in Shandong Province, China. Through standardization of service workflows following the Complete Contract Theory (CCT) and the infusion of an artificial intelligence (AI) engine to maximize the expected quality of service while reducing waiting time, the Smart Human-resource Services (SmartHS) platform transcends organizational boundaries and improves system efficiency. Deployments in 3 cities involving 2,000 participating civil servants and close to 3 million social insurance service cases over a 1 year period demonstrated that SmartHS significantly improves user experience with roughly a third of the original front desk staff. This new AI-enhanced mode of operation is useful for informing current policy discussions in many domains of government service provision.", "Clustering documents into coherent categories is a very useful and important step for document processing and understanding. The introducing of fuzzy set theory into clustering provides a favorable mechanism to capture overlapping among document clusters. Document dataset is commonly represented as a collection of high-dimensional vectors, which may not be able to fit into memory entirely, when the dataset is large and with a very high dimensionality. However, most of the existing fuzzy clustering approaches deal with small and static datasets. Some of them may have a good scalability but they are only effective for low dimensional data. The study presented in this paper is about new efforts on fuzzy clustering of large-scale and high-dimensional data-especially suitable for document categorization.

This technique not only ensures good machine learning performance but also maintains data privacy of the edge devices. However, the federated edge learning still faces the following critical challenges: (i) difficulty in avoiding unreliable edge devices acting as workers for federated edge learning, and (ii) lack of efficient learning task assignment schemes among task publishers and workers. To tackle these challenges, reputation is utilized as a metric to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of the edge devices. A many-to-one matching model is proposed to address the task assignment problem between task publishers and reliable workers with high reputation.

Based on the CAR model, we present a new type of agent, computational intelligent agent (CIA), which has the ability to model, reason and make decisions on behalf of human beings. Unlike traditional intelligent agents, CIA is able to represent knowledge and carry out the inferences using numeric representations and computation instead of symbolic representation and deduction. Thus, the construction of CIA is simplified and the implementation code is compact. CIA also has the ability to handle various types of fuzzy information. It can be applied to various agent applications, especially for electronic commerce over the Internet. An example of CIA as a buying agent is illustrated.", "Currently, the data collected by the Internet of Healthcare Things, i.e., healthcare oriented Internet of Things (IoT), still rely on cloud-based centralized data aggregation and processing. To reduce the need for transmission of data to the cloud, the edge computing architecture may be adopted to facilitate machine learning at the edge of the network through leveraging on the amassed computation resources of pervasive IoT devices. In this article, federated learning (FL) is proposed to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training at the edge of the network across distributed IoT users. However, the users in the FL network may have different willingness to participate (WTP), a hidden information unknown to the model owner.

Analysis proves that CrowdAsm can achieve close to optimal profit for workers in a given crowdsourcing system if they follow the recommendations.", "The increasing popularity and growth of mobile devices and location-based services enable us to utilize large-scale geo-tagged data to support novel location-based applications. This paper introduces a novel problem called the best region search (BRS) problem and provides efficient solutions to it. Given a set O of spatial objects, a submodular monotone aggregate score function, and the size a x b of a query rectangle, the BRS problem aims to find a x b rectangular region such that the aggregate score of the spatial objects inside the region is maximized. This problem is fundamental to support several real-world applications such as most influential region search (eg. the best location for a signage to attract most audience) and most diversified region search (eg. region with most diverse facilities).

The algorithm is designated to schedule more data transmission in bursty and high traffic load, thus enabling rapid dissemination of data and reduction of latency.

This paper addresses zero-shot transfer for cross-lingual NER, especially when the amount of source-language training data is also limited. The paper first proposes a simple but effective labeled sequence translation method to translate source-language training data to target languages and avoids problems such as word order change and entity span determination. With the source-language data as well as the translated data, a generation-based multilingual data augmentation method is introduced to further increase diversity by generating synthetic labeled data in multiple languages. These augmented data enable the language model based NER models to generalize better with both the language-specific features from the target-language synthetic data and the language-independent features from multilingual synthetic data. An extensive set of experiments were conducted to demonstrate encouraging cross-lingual transfer performance of the new research on a wide variety of target languages.", "Cooperative spectrum sensing by secondary user (SU) nodes in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is a promising approach to increase the spectrum access efficiency and overall network performance. However, unreliable sensing results or malicious behaviors from cooperator SU nodes can be very disruptive and reduce the network performance. Trust and reputation modeling has been identified as one of the potential solutions to address this problem, but the current centralized trust evaluation approach in CRN lacks scalability. Although some decentralized trust models have been proposed in CRN, without proper protection mechanisms, they are vulnerable to collusive behaviors by the witness SU nodes when they share testimonies about the trustworthiness of neighboring SU nodes. In this paper, we propose a clustering based witness selection method to address this problem. By dividing the witness SU nodes\u00a0\u2026", "Side information of items, e.g., images and text description, has shown to be effective in contributing to accurate recommendations. Inspired by the recent success of pre-training models on natural language and images, we propose a pre-training strategy to learn item representations by considering both item side information and their relationships. We relate items by common user activities, e.g., co-purchase, and construct a homogeneous item graph. This graph provides a unified view of item relations and their associated side information in multimodality. We develop a novel sampling algorithm named MCNSampling to select contextual neighbors for each item. The proposed Pre-trained Multimodal Graph Transformer (PMGT) learns item representations with two objectives: 1) graph structure reconstruction, and 2) masked node feature reconstruction.

Existing GNN-based methods explicitly model the dependency between an entity and its local graph context in KG (i.e., the set of its first-order neighbors), but may not be effective in capturing its non-local graph context (i.e., the set of most related high-order neighbors). In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework, named Contextualized Graph Attention Network (CGAT), which can explicitly exploit both local and non-local graph context information of an entity in KG. More specifically, CGAT captures the local context information by a user-specific graph attention mechanism, considering a user\u2019s personalized preferences on entities. In addition, CGAT employs a biased random walk sampling process to extract the non-local context of an entity, and utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network\u00a0\u2026", "Density peak clustering (DPC) is a recently developed density-based clustering algorithm that achieves competitive performance in a non-iterative manner. DPC is capable of effectively handling clusters with single density peak (single center), i.e., based on DPC\u2019s hypothesis, one and only one data point is chosen as the center of any cluster. However, DPC may fail to identify clusters with multiple density peaks (multi-centers) and may not be able to identify natural clusters whose centers have relatively lower local density. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clustering algorithm based on a hierarchical approach, named multi-center density peak clustering (McDPC).

Maximizing social welfare in such situations is known to be NP-hard. To address these fundamental challenges, we propose the surprise-minimization-value-maximization (SMVM) approach. By analysing typical crowdsourcing system dynamics, we established a simple and novel worker desirability index (WDI) jointly considering the effect of each worker\u2019s reputation, workload and motivation to work on collective productivity. Through evaluating workers\u2019 WDI values, SMVM influences individual workers in real time about courses of action which can benefit the workers and lead to high collective productivity.

Existing research in reputation-aware task delegation did not consider these two issues together. This limits their effectiveness in human-agent collectives such as crowdsourcing systems. In this paper, we propose a distributed reputation-aware task allocation approach - RATA-NL - to address these issues simultaneously. It is designed to help an individual human trustee determine the optimal number of task requests to accept at each time step based on his situation to maximize his long term well-being. The resulting task allocation maximizes social welfare through efficient utilization of the collective capacity of the trustees, and provides provable performance guarantees.

Accurately estimating the trustworthiness of a potential interaction partner is vital to a participant's well-being. It is generally recognized in the research community that third-party testimony sharing is an effective way for participants to gain knowledge about the trustworthiness of potential interaction partners without having to incur the risk of actually interacting with them. However, the presence of biased testimonies adversely affects a participant's long term well-being. Existing trust computational models often require complicated manual tuning of key parameters to combat biased testimonies. Such an approach heavily involves subjective judgments and adapts poorly to changes in an environment. In this study, we propose the Actor\u2013Critic Trust (ACT) model, which is an adaptive trust evidence\u00a0\u2026", "Usually, agents within multiagent systems represent different stakeholders that have their own distinct and sometimes conflicting interests and objectives. They would behave in such a way so as to achieve their own objectives, even at the cost of others. Therefore, there are risks in interacting with other agents. A number of computational trust models have been proposed to manage such risk. However, the performance of most computational trust models that rely on third-party recommendations as part of the mechanism to derive trust is easily deteriorated by the presence of unfair testimonies. There have been several attempts to combat the influence of unfair testimonies. Nevertheless, they are either not readily applicable since they require additional information which is not available in realistic settings, or ad hoc as they are tightly coupled with specific trust models.

As such, we propose a federated learning (FL) based approach to promote privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning for applications in smart industries. In our system model, a model owner initiates an FL task involving a group of workers, i.e., data owners, to perform model training on their locally stored data before transmitting the model updates for aggregation. There exists a tradeoff between service latency, i.e., the time taken for the training request to be completed, and age of information (AoI), i.e., the time elapsed between data aggregation from the deployed industrial Internet of Things devices to completion of the FL-based training. On one hand, if the data are collected only upon the model owner's request, the AoI is low.

Specifically, DC 2 B employs determinantal point process in the recommendation procedure to promote diversity of the recommendation results. To learn the model parameters, a Thompson sampling-type algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference is proposed. In addition, theoretical regret analysis is also provided to guarantee the performance of DC 2 B. Extensive experiments on real datasets are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in balancing the recommendation accuracy and diversity.", "Expert finding has become a hot topic along with the flourishing of social networks, such as micro-blogging services like Twitter. Finding experts in  Twitter  is an important problem because tweets from experts are valuable sources that carry rich information (e.g., trends) in various domains. However, previous methods cannot be directly applied to  Twitter  expert finding problem. Recently, several attempts use the relations among users and  Twitter List s for expert finding. Nevertheless, these approaches only partially utilize such relations. To this end, we develop a probabilistic method to jointly exploit three types of relations (i.e.,  follower  relation,  user-list  relation, and  list-list  relation) for finding experts. Specifically, we propose a  S emi- S upervised  G raph-based  R anking approach (  ) to offline calculate the  global authority  of users.

This research investigates interactions among selfish, rational, and autonomous agents in resource allocation, each with incomplete information about other entities, and each seeking to maximize its expected utility. This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).", "Data augmentation is an effective solution to data scarcity in low-resource scenarios. However, when applied to token-level tasks such as NER, data augmentation methods often suffer from token-label misalignment, which leads to unsatsifactory performance. In this work, we propose Masked Entity Language Modeling (MELM) as a novel data augmentation framework for low-resource NER. To alleviate the token-label misalignment issue, we explicitly inject NER labels into sentence context, and thus the fine-tuned MELM is able to predict masked entity tokens by explicitly conditioning on their labels. Thereby, MELM generates high-quality augmented data with novel entities, which provides rich entity regularity knowledge and boosts NER performance. When training data from multiple languages are available, we also integrate MELM with code-mixing for further improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MELM on monolingual, cross-lingual and multilingual NER across various low-resource levels. Experimental results show that our MELM presents substantial improvement over the baseline methods.", "Hierarchical crowdsourcing networks (HCNs) provide a useful mechanism for social mobilization. However, spontaneous evolution of the complex resource allocation dynamics can lead to undesirable herding behaviours in which a small group of reputable workers are overloaded while leaving other workers idle. Existing herding control mechanisms designed for typical crowdsourcing systems are not effective in HCNs. In order to bridge this gap, we investigate the herding dynamics in HCNs and propose a Lyapunov optimization based decision support approach - the Reputation-aware Task Sub-delegation approach with dynamic worker effort Pricing (RTS-P) - with objective functions aiming to achieve superlinear time-averaged collective productivity in an HCN. By considering the workers\u2019 current reputation, workload, eagerness to work, and trust relationships, RTS-P provides a systematic approach to mitigate\u00a0\u2026", "There exist a number of similarity-based recommendation communities, within which similar users' opinions are collected by users' agents to make predictions of their opinions on a new item.

In this paper, we propose a trust-based community to overcome these limitations. The trust-based recommendation community incorporates trust into the domain of item recommendation. Experimental results based on a real dataset show that trust-based community manages to outperform its similarity-based counterpart in terms of prediction accuracy, coverage, and robustness in the presence of noise.", "Multi-label feature selection has received considerable attentions during the past decade. However, existing algorithms do not attempt to uncover the underlying causal mechanism, and individually solve different types of variable relationships, ignoring the mutual effects between them. Furthermore, these algorithms lack of interpretability, which can only select features for all labels, but cannot explain the correlation between a selected feature and a certain label. To address these problems, in this paper, we theoretically study the causal relationships in multi-label data, and propose a novel Markov blanket based multi-label causal feature selection (MB-MCF) algorithm. MB-MCF mines the causal mechanism of labels and features first, to obtain a complete representation of information about labels. Based on the causal relationships, MB-MCF then selects predictive features and simultaneously distinguishes common features shared by multiple labels and label-specific features owned by single labels. Experiments on real-world data sets validate that MB-MCF could automatically determine the number of selected features and simultaneously achieve the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. An experiment in Emotions data set further demonstrates the interpretability of MB-MCF.", "A method and apparatus are proposed for allocating a plurality of human intelligence tasks (HIT) to corresponding human workers.

The optimization problem is formulated using a measure of a target workload for each worker and a measure of each worker's current situation.", "The rapid development of Electric Vehicles (EVs) seen in recent years has been drawing increasing attentions from the public, markets, decision-makers, and academia. Notwithstanding the progress, issues still remain. Because of the widely complained disadvantages of limited battery capacity and long charging time, charging convenience has become a top concern that greatly hinders the adoption of EVs. Specialized EV charging station, which provides more than 10 times faster charging speed than domestic charging, is therefore a critical element for successful EV promotion. While most existing researches focus on optimizing spatial placement of charging stations, they are inflexible and inefficient against rapidly changing urban structure and traffic pattern. Therefore, this paper approaches the management of EV charging stations from the pricing perspective as a more flexible and adaptive complement to established charging station placement. In this paper, we build a realistic pricing model in consideration of residential travel pattern and EV drivers\u2019 self-interested charging behavior, traffic congestion, and operating expense of charging stations. We formulate the pricing problem as a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, and propose a scalable algorithm to solve it.

At present, state-of-the-art approaches for building classifiers can basically recognize limited classes trained in the learning phase; however, due to the complex diversity of social contextual behavior, the built classifier seldom deals with newly appeared contexts, which results in degrading the recognition performance greatly. To address this problem, we propose, an OSELM (online sequential extreme learning machine) based class incremental learning method for continuous and unobtrusive sensing new classes of social contexts from dynamic Bluetooth data alone. We integrate fuzzy clustering technique and OSELM to discover and recognize social contextual behaviors by real-world Bluetooth sensor data\u00a0\u2026", "Feature-engineering-based machine learning models and deep learning models have been explored for wearable-sensor-based human activity recognition. For both types of methods, one crucial research issue is how to extract proper features from the partitioned segments of multivariate sensor readings. Existing methods have different drawbacks: 1) feature-engineering-based methods are able to extract meaningful features, such as statistical or structural information underlying the segments, but usually require manual designs of features for different applications, which is time consuming, and 2) deep learning models are able to learn temporal and/or spatial features from the sensor data automatically, but fail to capture statistical information. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model to automatically learn meaningful features including statistical features, temporal features and spatial correlation features for activity recognition in a unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "Most existing word embedding methods can be categorized into Neural Embedding Models and Matrix Factorization (MF)-based methods. However some models are opaque to probabilistic interpretation, and MF-based methods, typically solved using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), may incur loss of corpus information. In addition, it is desirable to incorporate global latent factors, such as topics, sentiments or writing styles, into the word embedding model. Since generative models provide a principled way to incorporate latent factors, we propose a generative word embedding model, which is easy to interpret, and can serve as a basis of more sophisticated latent factor models. The model inference reduces to a low rank weighted positive semidefinite approximation problem. Its optimization is approached by eigendecomposition on a submatrix, followed by online blockwise regression, which is scalable and avoids the information loss in SVD. In experiments on 7 common benchmark datasets, our vectors are competitive to word2vec, and better than other MF-based methods.", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success in image translation and manipulation.

To handle the quadratic complexity incurred by building the dense correspondences, we introduce a bi-level feature alignment strategy that adopts a top-k operation to rank block-wise features followed by dense attention between block features which reduces memory cost substantially.

Most of the existing web service selection mechanisms are capability oriented or function oriented. We propose a trust-based web service selection approach to augment the current web service mechanisms. A trust model from our previous research, which offers strong protection against the adverse effect of unfair ratings from witnesses, is incorporated into an agent augmented service oriented virtual community. An experiment based on the virtual community system is conducted to study the effectiveness of the model in enabling trust agents to select highly trustworthy web services\u00a0\u2026", "Currently, much of machine learning is opaque, just like a\" black box.\" However, in order for humans to understand, trust and effectively manage the emerging AI systems, an AI needs to be able to explain its decisions and conclusions.

During field studies of VS, we observed that students in virtual world tend to be attracted by visual and auditorial stimuli and be distracted from learning objectives. Also, intensive cognitive load can affect students\u2019 learning experience. To address these issues, we propose two types of companion agent, namely curious companion and remembrance companion. Results collected from the field studies indicate advantages of learning companion augmented virtual world in enhancing students\u2019 learning experience.", "Riding on the back of the rapid expansion of the Internet, online virtual worlds which combine the prowess of interactive digital media and social networks have attained a high level of acceptance among the Net Generation users. This development prompted researchers to look into the potential of embedding learning contents into virtual worlds to create virtual learning environments (VLEs) that suit the need of the Net Generation learners. However, the special characteristics of virtual worlds that make them popular also pose great challenges to educators who wish to leverage their power. These challenges call for more sophisticated human computer interaction (HCI) mechanisms to assist learners to navigate the intriguing landscape of VLEs. In this paper, we demonstrate a teachable remembrance agent which acts as an intelligent user interface to provide innovative ways for students to interact with VLEs.", "This chapter describes a program of research that is exploring pedagogical, technological, and aesthetic dimensions for designing virtual worlds for learning.

This creates a common bottleneck in fuzzy system design. In order to solve this problem, many fuzzy systems that automatically generate fuzzy rules from numerical data have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy neural network based on mutual subsethood (MSBFNN) and its fuzzy rule identification algorithms. In our approach, fuzzy rules are described by different fuzzy sets. For each fuzzy set representing a fuzzy rule, the universe of discourse is defined as the summation of weighted membership grades of input linguistic terms that associate with the given fuzzy rule. In this manner, MSBFNN fully considers the contribution of input variables to the joint firing strength of fuzzy rules. Afterwards, the proposed fuzzy neural network quantifies the impacts of fuzzy rules on the consequent parts by fuzzy connections\u00a0\u2026", "There is an increasing need for various Web-service, e-commerce and e-business sites to provide personalized recommendations to on-line customers. This paper proposes a new type of personalized recommendation agents called fuzzy cognitive agents. Fuzzy cognitive agents are designed to give personalized suggestions based on the user's current personal preferences, other user's common preferences, and an expert's domain knowledge. Fuzzy cognitive agents are able to represent knowledge via extended fuzzy cognitive maps, learn users' preferences from most recent cases, and help customers make inferences and decisions through numeric computation instead of symbolic and logic deduction. A case study is included to illustrate how personalized recommendations are made by fuzzy cognitive agents in e-commerce sites. The case study demonstrates that the fuzzy cognitive agent is both flexible and\u00a0\u2026", "In wearable-sensor-based activity recognition, it is often assumed that the training and test samples follow the same data distribution. This assumption neglects practical scenarios where the activity patterns inevitably vary from person to person. To solve this problem, transfer learning and domain adaptation approaches are often leveraged to reduce the gaps between different participants. Nevertheless, these approaches require additional information (ie, labeled or unlabeled data, meta-information) from the target domain during the training stage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Generalizable Independent Latent Excitation (GILE) for human activity recognition, which greatly enhances the cross-person generalization capability of the model. Our proposed method is superior to existing methods in the sense that it does not require any access to the target domain information. Besides, this novel model can be directly applied to various target domains without re-training or fine-tuning. Specifically, the proposed model learns to automatically disentangle domain-agnostic and domain-specific features, the former of which are expected to be invariant across various persons. To further remove correlations between the two types of features, a novel Independent Excitation mechanism is incorporated in the latent feature space. Comprehensive experimental evaluations are conducted on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art solutions.", "As many countries in the world start to experience population aging, there are an increasing number of people relying on medical insurance to access healthcare resources.

However, the problem of unfair testimonies has to be addressed effectively to improve the robustness of reputation systems. Until now, most of the existing approaches focus only on reputation systems using binary testimonies, and thus have limited applicability and effectiveness.

Many researches in pedagogical science have confirmed the importance of being curious to the students' cognitive development. However, in the newly popular virtual world-based learning environments (VLEs), there is currently a lack of attention being paid to enhancing the learning experience by stimulating the learners' curiosity. In this paper, we propose a simple model for curious agents (CAs) which can be used to stimulate learners' curiosity in VLEs. Potential future research directions will be discussed.", "Recent developments in games and interactive storytelling applications have seen artificially intelligent computer controlled characters being included extensively. Non-human controlled characters are starting to play an increasingly significant role in enhancing the perceived intelligence of games. Although many of them employed certain cheating techniques (e.g. allocating more resources at the start to AI opponents to make them appear more aggressive), some limited learning did appear in several games (e.g. letting AI opponents remember where human users initiated attacked in previous game).

How to mitigate the influence of the unfair ratings remains an important issue in online rating systems.

Experimental results show that the proposed method is both effective and practical in alleviating the influence of different types of unfair ratings.", "Inter-organizational collaborative product development relies heavily on Internet-based technology. As heterogeneous computer environments are typically used in such cases, problems related with data sharing and work coordination at the global level are basic obstacles for widespread implementation of the concept of virtual engineering teams in global product development.

Specifically, we first train a GAN model without text input, aiming to generate images with high diversity and quality. Then we learn a GAN inversion model to convert the images back to the GAN latent space and obtain the inverted latent codes for each image, where we introduce the cycle-consistency training to learn more robust and consistent inverted latent codes.

Illegal smuggling activities are usually blocked via inspection stations or ad-hoc checkpoints/roadblocks. Security resources are insufficient to man all stations at all times; furthermore, smugglers regularly conduct surveillance activities. This paper makes several contributions toward the challenging task of optimally interdicting an illegal network flow: i) A new Stackelberg game model for network flow interdiction; ii) A novel Column and Constraint Generation approach for computing the optimal defender strategy; iii) Complexity analysis of the column generation subproblem; iv) Compact convex nonlinear programs for solving the subproblems; v) Novel greedy and heuristic approaches for subproblems with good approximation guarantee.

FCMs have advantages such as simplicity, supporting of inconsistent knowledge, and circle causalities for knowledge modeling and inference. However, the lack of the time dimension limits the usage of FCMs from the long term inference and the time related knowledge modeling. In order to narrow down the gap, a temporalized FCM is proposed to define a complete discrete temporal extension of the FCM. To reduce the complexities brought by the temporalization, a design approach is also introduced to construct the map, using simplified patterns and fuzzy logic based effect functions to capture fuzzy knowledge from domain experts.

The quality of the CAMs has a crucial impact on the performance of the segmentation model. We propose to improve the CAMs from a novel graph perspective. We model paired images containing common classes with a bipartite graph and use the maximum matching algorithm to locate corresponding areas in two images. The matching areas are then used to refine the predicted object regions in the CAMs. The experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset show that our network can effectively boost the performance of the baseline model and achieves new\u00a0\u2026", "Although dispersing one single task to distributed learning nodes has been intensively studied by the previous research, multi-task learning on distributed networks is still an area that has not been fully exploited, especially under decentralized settings.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to overcome this challenge and enable learning multiple tasks simultaneously on a decentralized distributed network. Specifically, the learning framework can be separated into two phases: (i) multi-task information is shared within each node on the first phase; (ii) communication between nodes then leads the whole network to converge to a common minimizer.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of familiarity in design on the adoption of wellness games for the elderly. We propose a familiarity design framework with three familiarity design elements: 1) symbolic familiarity, 2) cultural familiarity, and 3) actionable familiarity. We then conduct a focused group study involving 10 people over 65 years old to experience two wellnesses games - one with familiarity based design considerations and one without.

Motivated by this, orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), which is very successful in mobile communications for its low complexity and high performance, has already been investigated for MIMO backscatter RFID. Also a recently proposed scheme called unitary query was shown to be able to considerably improve the reliability of MIMO backscatter RFID by exploiting query diversity. Therefore, incorporating the classical OSTBC (at the tag end) with the unitary query (at the query end) seems promising. However, in this paper, we first show that simple direct employment of OSTBC together with unitary query incurs a linear decoding problem and eventually leads to severe performance degradation.

Unlike conventional online learning tasks, online active learning is considerably more challenging because of two reasons. First, it is difficult to design an effective query strategy to decide when is appropriate to query the label of an incoming instance given limited query budget. Second, it is also challenging to decide how to update the predictive models effectively whenever the true label of an instance is queried. Most existing approaches for online active learning are often based on a family of first-order online learning algorithms, which are simple and efficient but fall short in the slow convergence and sub-optimal solution in exploiting the labeled training data. To solve these issues, this paper presents a novel framework of Second-order Online Active Learning (SOAL) by fully\u00a0\u2026", "In cloud computing, a private (secondary) cloud can: 1) outsource workload to public (primary) clouds via vertical federation or 2) share resources with other secondary clouds through horizontal federation to enhance its service quality.

To fill the gap, we analyze the interrelated workload factoring and federation formation among secondary clouds, while providing scalable algorithms to assist them to optimally select partners and outsource workload. We use a game theoretic approach to model the federation formation of clouds as a coalition game with externalities.

To overcome the limitations, this paper investigates an online learning framework for big data stream classification tasks. Unlike some existing online data stream classification techniques that are often based on first-order online learning, we propose a framework of Sparse Online Classification (SOC) for data stream classification, which includes some state-of-the-art first-order sparse online learning algorithms as special cases and allows us to derive a new effective second-order online\u00a0\u2026", "Existing Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis relies heavily on doctors' observations combined with neurological exams.

In this paper, we describe an agent-based game for the predictive diagnosis of PD. Agents in this tablet based game provide companionship, encouragement, and analysis capabilities to help retain users' interest, and analyze their risk of developing PD symptoms based on their in-game behavior. The game has been launched together with a world renowned PD research centre for clinical trial.

Dede [2] suggests that the immersive interfaces offered by virtual worlds can promote learning, by enabling the design of educational experiences that are challenging or even impossible to duplicate in real world. In recent years, the usage of virtual worlds within the educational context is growing quickly. The New Media Consortium (NMC) Annual Survey on Second Life (SL) received 170% increase in response rate between 2007 and 2008. They also found that many of the educators who earlier used the existing SL, have started creating their own virtual worlds in less than a year's time [3].", "The interactive recommendation systems have recently attracted lots of research attentions, because they can model the interactions between the user and the recommender system. Most previous interactive recommendation methods only focus on optimizing recommendation accuracy. However, they usually overlook other important aspects of recommendation quality, e.g., the diversity of recommendation results. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation framework, called Diversity-promoting Deep Reinforcement Learning (D2RL), which aims to promote the diversity of interactive recommendation results. In D2RL, the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) is used to generate diverse, while relevant item recommendations. For each user, a personalized DPP kernel matrix is maintained, which is constructed from two parts: a fixed similarity matrix capturing item-item similarity, and the relevance of items\u00a0\u2026", "Cross-domain recommendation methods usually transfer knowledge across different domains implicitly, by sharing model parameters or learning parameter mappings in the latent space. Differing from previous studies, this work focuses on learning the explicit mapping between a user\u2019s behaviors (ie, interaction itemsets) in different domains during the same temporal period. In this paper, we propose a novel deep cross-domain recommendation model, called Cycle Generation Networks (CGN). Specifically, CGN employs two generators to construct the dual-direction personalized itemset mapping between a user\u2019s behaviors in two different domains over time. The generators are learned by optimizing the distance between the generated itemset and the real interacted itemset, as well as the cycle consistency loss defined based on the dual-direction generation procedure. We have performed extensive experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparing with existing single-domain and cross-domain recommendation methods.", "The existence of noisy labels in real-world data negatively impacts the performance of deep learning models. Although much research effort has been devoted to improving robustness to noisy labels in classification tasks, the problem of noisy labels in deep metric learning (DML) remains open. In this paper, we propose a noise-resistant training technique for DML, which we name Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance Selection with Memory (PRISM). PRISM identifies noisy data in a minibatch using average similarity against image features extracted by several previous versions of the neural network. These features are stored in and retrieved from a memory bank. To alleviate the high computational cost brought by the memory bank, we introduce an acceleration method that replaces individual data points with the class centers. In extensive comparisons with 12 existing approaches under both synthetic and real-world label noise, PRISM demonstrates superior performance of up to 6.06% in Precision@ 1.", "Food recognition for user-uploaded images is crucial in visual diet tracking, an emerging application linking multimedia and healthcare domains. However, it is challenging due to the various visual appearances of food images.

To alleviate such a semantic gap, this paper presents a cross-modal alignment and transfer network (ATNet), which is motivated by the paradigm of learning using privileged information (LUPI). It additionally utilizes the ingredients in food images as an \"intelligent teacher\" in the training stage to facilitate cross-modal information passing.

It uses numeric representations and computation instead of symbolic representation and logic deduction to represent knowledge and to carry out the inferences respectively.  Thus the construction of DIA is simplified and the implementation code is compact. The application of DIA to various areas, especially for electronic commerce over the Internet is exemplified.", "Game theoretic models of security, and associated computational methods, have emerged as critical components of security posture across a broad array of domains, including airport security and coast guard. These approaches consider terrorists as motivated but independent entities. There is, however, increasing evidence that attackers, be it terrorists or cyber attackers, communicate extensively and form coalitions that can dramatically increase their ability to achieve malicious goals. To date, such cooperative decision making among attackers has been ignored in the security games literature. To address the issue of cooperation among attackers, we introduce a novel coalitional security game (CSG) model. A CSG consists of a set of attackers connected by a (communication or trust) network who can form coalitions as connected subgraphs of this network so as to attack a collection of targets. A defender in a CSG can delete a set of edges, incurring a cost for deleting each edge, with the goal of optimally limiting the attackers\u2019 ability to form effective coalitions (in terms of successfully attacking high value targets). We first show that a CSG is, in general, hard to approximate. Nevertheless, we develop a novel branch and price algorithm, leveraging a combination of column generation, relaxation, greedy approximation, and stabilization methods to enable scalable high-quality approximations of CSG solutions on realistic problem instances.", "The open space characteristic and the lack of a strict script in the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) often pose the learners in a state of confusion or being lost. This phenomenon adversely affects the learning outcomes. Curious learning companions, who detect interesting learning objects tailored to the learner's current level of knowledge, can unobtrusively prevent them from experiencing such confusion. Hence, we present a comprehensive computational model of curiosity based on the psychological theory by Berlyne. For modeling the complex relationships between curiosity stimulating factors, we employ Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). To test our model's effectiveness, we implement it into a learning companion and conduct two case studies.

Despite the merits, tolls are usually pre-determined and fixed from day to day, which fail to consider traffic dynamics and thus have limited regulation effect when traffic conditions are abnormal. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic ETC (DyETC) scheme which adjusts tolls to traffic conditions in realtime. The DyETC problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), the solution of which is very challenging due to its 1) multi-dimensional state space, 2) multi-dimensional, continuous and bounded action space, and 3) time-dependent state and action values. Due to the complexity of the formulated MDP, existing methods cannot be applied to our problem. Therefore, we develop a novel algorithm, PG-beta, which makes three improvements to traditional policy gradient method by proposing 1) time-dependent value and policy functions, 2) Beta distribution policy function and 3) state abstraction. Experimental results show that, compared with existing ETC schemes, DyETC increases traffic volume by around 8%, and reduces travel time by around 14: 6% during rush hour. Considering the total traffic volume in a traffic network, this contributes to a substantial increase to social welfare.", "The rapidly expanding elderly population is a significant niche market for game developers. However, the main target audiences of the existing digital games are young generations, who do not warrant the special needs required by elderly. In this paper, based on the field study of game for elderly - Chinese Water Painting - we propose a curious companion for the elderly. The curious mechanism of the artificial companion is developed based on Berlyne's model of curiosity. The implementation considers three needs of the elderly: the smoothness of game playing, the entertainment, and the caring for the elderly. A preliminary study suggests a wide range acceptance of the curious companion.", "Coalition formation methods allow autonomous agents to join together in order to act as a coherent group in which they increase their individual gains by collaborating with each other.

Based on a novel social reasoning theory, namely, transitive dependence theory, this work proposes two dynamic coalition formation algorithms for coalition formation: 1) without and-action dependence and 2) with and-action dependence, respectively. While most related work addresses the problem of searching for the optimal coalition structure (CS), the proposed algorithms aim to find out the optimal coalitions for specific goals.

However, compared with image captioning datasets, the target recipes are long-length paragraphs and do not have annotations on structure information. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework of Structure-aware Generation Network (SGN) to tackle the food recipe generation task.

Given a query facial image for annotation, the idea of SBFA is to first search for top-n similar facial images from a web facial image database and then exploit these top-ranked similar facial images and their weak labels for naming the query facial image. To fully mine those information, this paper proposes a novel framework of Learning to Name Faces (L2NF) -- a unified multimodal learning approach for search-based face annotation, which consists of the following major components: (i) we enhance the weak labels of top-ranked similar images by exploiting the \"label smoothness\"\u00a0\u2026", "The pre-trained neural models have recently achieved impressive performance in understanding multimodal content. However, it is still very challenging to pre-train neural models for video and language understanding, especially for Chinese video-language data, due to the following reasons. Firstly, existing video-language pre-training algorithms mainly focus on the co-occurrence of words and video frames, but ignore other valuable semantic and structure information of video-language content, e.g., sequential order and spatiotemporal relationships. Secondly, there exist conflicts between video sentence alignment and other proxy tasks. Thirdly, there is a lack of large-scale and high-quality Chinese video-language datasets (eg. including 10 million unique videos), which are the fundamental success conditions for pre-training techniques. In this work, we propose a novel video-language understanding framework\u00a0\u2026", "We study the problem of imposing conversational goals/keywords on open-domain conversational agents, where the agent is required to lead the conversation to a target keyword smoothly and fast. Solving this problem enables the application of conversational agents in many real-world scenarios, eg, recommendation and psychotherapy. The dominant paradigm for tackling this problem is to 1) train a next-turn keyword classifier, and 2) train a keyword-augmented response retrieval model. However, existing approaches in this paradigm have two limitations: 1) the training and evaluation datasets for next-turn keyword classification are directly extracted from conversations without human annotations, thus, they are noisy and have low correlation with human judgements, and 2) during keyword transition, the agents solely rely on the similarities between word embeddings to move closer to the target keyword, which may not reflect how humans converse. In this paper, we assume that human conversations are grounded on commonsense and propose a keyword-guided neural conversational model that can leverage external commonsense knowledge graphs (CKG) for both keyword transition and response retrieval. Automatic evaluations suggest that commonsense improves the performance of both next-turn keyword prediction and keyword-augmented response retrieval. In addition, both self-play and human evaluations show that our model produces responses with smoother keyword transition and reaches the target keyword faster than competitive baselines.", "The user review data have been demonstrated to be effective in solving different recommendation problems. Previous review-based recommendation methods usually employ sophisticated compositional models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to learn semantic representations from the review data for recommendation. However, these methods mainly capture the local dependency between neighbouring words in a word window, and they treat each review equally. Therefore, they may not be effective in capturing the global dependency between words, and tend to be easily biased by noise review information. In this paper, we propose a novel review-based recommendation model, named Review Graph Neural Network (RGNN). Specifically, RGNN builds a specific review graph for each individual user/item, which provides a global view about the user/item\u00a0\u2026", "In 5G and Beyond networks, Artificial Intelligence applications are expected to be increasingly ubiquitous. This necessitates a paradigm shift from the current cloud-centric model training approach to the Edge Computing based collaborative learning scheme known as edge learning, in which model training is executed at the edge of the network. In this article, we first introduce the principles and technologies of collaborative edge learning. Then, we establish that a successful, scalable implementation of edge learning requires the communication, caching, computation, and learning resources (3C-L) of end devices and edge servers to be leveraged jointly in an efficient manner. However, users may not consent to contribute their resources without receiving adequate compensation. In consideration of the heterogeneity of edge nodes, e.g., in terms of available computation resources, we discuss the challenges of incentive mechanism design to facilitate resource sharing for edge learning. Furthermore, we present a case study involving optimal auction design using Deep Learning to price fresh data contributed for edge learning. The performance evaluation shows the revenue maximizing properties of our proposed auction over the benchmark schemes.", "Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is an increasingly common surgery worldwide. A significant contributor to TKR success is post-surgical rehabilitation. In this work, we present Fun-Knee\u2122, a novel sensor-equipped knee support complemented by mobile device-supported games, specifically designed for \u201cgamified\u201d TKR rehabilitation. Two inclinometers are used to measure the knee angle, which is used as the main input to the developed game. Human-Centered Design theory is applied throughout the game design to ensure a customized, dynamic gaming experience to maximize the pain distraction effect and to increase the exercise compliance and improve the rehabilitation outcome. Preliminary survey results collected from practicing physiotherapists show promising outcomes of the developed prototype, in terms of hardware and software characteristics, usability, clinical utility and overall effectiveness.", "Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used to learn informative latent representations of users and items from observed interactions. Existing CF-based methods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That is, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved pairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined distribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is computationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled under the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed positive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled from the training dataset could be positive in the test set. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL), has emerged as a powerful tool to learn a model without negative samples. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised collaborative\u00a0\u2026", "The sequential recommendation systems capture users' dynamic behavior patterns to predict their next interaction behaviors. Most existing sequential recommendation methods only exploit the local context information of an individual interaction sequence and learn model parameters solely based on the item prediction loss. Thus, they usually fail to learn appropriate sequence representations. This paper proposes a novel recommendation framework, namely Graph Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (GCL4SR). Specifically, GCL4SR employs a Weighted Item Transition Graph (WITG), built based on interaction sequences of all users, to provide global context information for each interaction and weaken the noise information in the sequence data. Moreover, GCL4SR uses subgraphs of WITG to augment the representation of each interaction sequence. Two auxiliary learning objectives have also been proposed to maximize the consistency between augmented representations induced by the same interaction sequence on WITG, and minimize the difference between the representations augmented by the global context on WITG and the local representation of the original sequence. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GCL4SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.", null, "Much recent progress in task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems has been driven by available annotation data across multiple domains for training. Over the last few years, there has been a move towards data curation for multilingual ToD systems that are applicable to serve people speaking different languages. However, existing multilingual ToD datasets either have a limited coverage of languages due to the high cost of data curation, or ignore the fact that dialogue entities barely exist in countries speaking these languages. To tackle these limitations, we introduce a novel data curation method that generates GlobalWoZ -- a large-scale multilingual ToD dataset globalized from an English ToD dataset for three unexplored use cases. Our method is based on translating dialogue templates and filling them with local entities in the target-language countries. We release our dataset as well as a set of strong baselines to encourage research on learning multilingual ToD systems for real use cases.", "Coverage control is one of the most fundamental issues in directional sensor networks. In this paper, the coverage optimization problem in a directional sensor network is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. It takes into account the coverage rate of the network, the number of working sensor nodes and the connectivity of the network. The coverage problem considered in this paper is characterized by the geographical irregularity of the sensed events and heterogeneity of the sensor nodes in terms of sensing radius, field of angle and communication radius. To solve this multi-objective problem, we introduce a learning automata-based coral reef algorithm for adaptive parameter selection and use a novel Tchebycheff decomposition method to decompose the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem. Simulation results show the consistent superiority of the proposed algorithm over alternative approaches.", "Interactive storytelling attracts a lot of research interests among the interactive entertainments in recent years. Designing story plot for interactive storytelling is currently one of the most critical problems of interactive storytelling. Some traditional AI planning methods, such as Hierarchical Task Network, Heuristic Searching Method are widely used as the planning tool for the story plot design. This paper proposes a model called Fuzzy Cognitive Goal Net as the story plot planning tool for interactive storytelling, which combines the planning capability of Goal net and reasoning ability of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Compared to conventional methods, the proposed model shows a well-established temporal structure for story plot. It delegates the storytelling process to drama manager agent and sub drama manager agents. Dynamic storylines are prepared for the audiences' interactions.

Endowing agents with rationality and emotion has been one of the major milestones in AI. However, in the field of conversational AI, most existing models only specialize in one aspect and neglect the other, which often leads to dull or unrelated responses. In this paper, we hypothesize that combining rationality and emotion into conversational agents can improve response quality. To test the hypothesis, we focus on one fundamental aspect of rationality, ie, commonsense, and propose CARE, a novel model for commonsense-aware emotional response generation. Specifically, we first propose a framework to learn and construct commonsense-aware emotional latent concepts of the response given an input message and a desired emotion. We then propose three methods to collaboratively incorporate the latent concepts into response generation. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets support our hypothesis and show that our model can produce more accurate and commonsense-aware emotional responses and achieve better human ratings than state-of-the-art models that only specialize in one aspect.", "This paper investigates the problem of online active learning for training classification models from sequentially arriving data. This is more challenging than conventional online learning tasks since the learner not only needs to figure out how to effectively update the classifier but also needs to decide when is the best time to query the label of an incoming instance given limited label budget. The existing online active learning approaches are often based on first-order online learning methods which generally fall short in slow convergence rate and sub-optimal exploitation of available information when querying the labeled data. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, we present a new framework of Second-order Online Active Learning (SOAL), which fully exploits both first-order and second-order information to achieve high learning accuracy with low labeling cost.

When such contents are actually needed as reference to reply a post in an online conversation, however, the user may not be able to retrieve them with proper cues or may even forget their existence at all. In this paper, we study this problem in the online conversation context and investigate how to automatically retrieve the most context-relevant previously-seen web information without user intervention. We propose a Context-aware Personal Information Retrieval (CPIR) algorithm, which considers both the participatory and implicit-topical properties of the context to improve the retrieval performance. Since both the context and the user's web information are usually short and ambiguous, the participatory context is utilized to formulate and expand the query.

ProFNN integrates the probabilistic information of fuzzy rules into the antecedent parts and quantifies the impacts of the rules on the consequent parts using mutual subsethood, which work in conjunction with volume defuzzification in a gradient descent learning frame work. Despite the increase in the number of parameters, ProFNN provides a promising solution to deal with randomness and fuzziness in a single frame.

In recent years, diversity has gained tremendous attention in recommender systems research, which has been recognized to be an important factor for improving user satisfaction. On the one hand, diversified recommendation helps increase the chance of answering ephemeral user needs. On the other hand, diversifying recommendation results can help the business improve product visibility and explore potential user interests. In this paper, we are going to review the recent advances in diversified recommendation. Specifically, we first review the various definitions of diversity and generate a taxonomy to shed light on how diversity have been modeled or measured in recommender systems. After that, we summarize the major optimization approaches to diversified recommendation from a taxonomic view. Last but not the least, we project into the future and point out trending research directions on this topic.", "In literature, learning with expert advice methods usually assume that a learner always obtain the true label of every incoming training instance at the end of each trial. However, in many real-world applications, acquiring the true labels of all instances can be both costly and time consuming, especially for large-scale problems. For example, in the social media, data stream usually comes in a high speed and volume, and it is nearly impossible and highly costly to label all of the instances. In this article, we address this problem with active learning with expert advice, where the ground truth of an instance is disclosed only when it is requested by the proposed active query strategies. Our goal is to minimize the number of requests while training an online learning model without sacrificing the performance. To address this challenge, we propose a framework of active forecasters, which attempts to extend two fully\u00a0\u2026", "Interactive storytelling in the virtual environment attracts a lot of research interests in recent years. Story plot and character are two most important elements of a story. Based on these two elements, currently there are two research directions: plot-based and character-based interactive storytelling. However, plot-based approach lacks the refinement of character behaviors as character-based approach. On the other side, character-based approach does not follow a well organized story plot so that the moral of the story might be distorted. Therefore, there is a need to develop an integrated framework to achieve the balance between conveying story moral and enhancing the modeling of character behaviors.

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommender systems have become an emerging research topic in recent years, owing to the interactive nature and autonomous learning ability. Empirical results show that RL-based recommendation methods often surpass supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, there are various challenges in applying RL in recommender systems. To understand the challenges and relevant solutions, there should be a reference for researchers and practitioners working on RL-based recommender systems. To this end, we first provide a thorough overview, comparisons, and summarization of RL approaches applied in four typical recommendation scenarios, including interactive recommendation, conversational recommendation, sequential recommendation, and\u00a0\u2026", "The advent of neural network (NN) based deep learning, especially the recent development of the automatic design of networks, has brought unprecedented performance gains at heavy computational cost. On the other hand, in order to generate a new consensus block, Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchain systems routinely perform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes but to solving a difficult cryptographic hash puzzle problem.In this study, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Learning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for block consensus toward optimization of neural networks. In our design, the training and testing data are released to the entire blockchain network and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. As a core component of PoLe, we design a secure mapping layer (SML) to prevent consensus\u00a0\u2026", "The consensus algorithm is the core component of a blockchain system, which determines the efficiency, security, and scalability of the blockchain network.

In this demo, we channels the otherwise wasted computational power to the practical purpose of training neural network models, through the proposed proof of learning (PoL) consensus algorithm. In PoLe, the training/testing data are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When the consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is appended to the blockchain. Through our system, we investigate the potential of enpowering machine learning with consensus building on blockchains.", "The interactive recommender systems involve users in the recommendation procedure by receiving timely user feedback to update the recommendation policy. Therefore, they are widely used in real application scenarios. Previous interactive recommendation methods primarily focus on learning users' personalized preferences on the relevance properties of an item set. However, the investigation of users' personalized preferences on the diversity properties of an item set is usually ignored. To overcome this problem, we propose the Linear Modular Dispersion Bandit (LMDB) framework, which is an online learning setting for optimizing a combination of modular functions and dispersion functions. Specifically, LMDB employs modular functions to model the relevance properties of each item, and dispersion functions to describe the diversity properties of an item set. Moreover, we also develop a learning algorithm, called Linear Modular Dispersion Hybrid (LMDH) to solve the LMDB problem and derive a gap-free bound on its n-step regret. Extensive experiments on real datasets are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LMDB framework in balancing the recommendation accuracy and diversity.", "Distributed computing has become a common approach for large-scale computation of tasks due to benefits such as high reliability, scalability, computation speed, and costeffectiveness. However, distributed computing faces critical issues related to communication load and straggler effects. In particular, computing nodes need to exchange intermediate results with each other in order to calculate the final result, and this significantly increases communication overheads. Furthermore, a distributed computing network may include straggling nodes that run intermittently slower. This results in a longer overall time needed to execute the computation tasks, thereby limiting the performance of distributed computing. To address these issues, coded distributed computing (CDC), i.e., a combination of coding theoretic techniques and distributed computing, has been recently proposed as a promising solution. Coding theoretic techniques have proved effective in WiFi and cellular systems to deal with channel noise. Therefore, CDC may significantly reduce communication load, alleviate the effects of stragglers, provide fault-tolerance, privacy and security. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of CDC, followed by basic CDC schemes. Then, we review and analyze a number of CDC approaches proposed to reduce the communication costs, mitigate the straggler effects, and guarantee privacy and security. Furthermore, we present and discuss applications of CDC in modern computer networks. Finally, we highlight important challenges and promising research directions related to CDC", "Today, most endeavours require teamwork by people with diverse skills and characteristics. In managing teamwork, decisions are often made under uncertainty and resource constraints.

It presents the participants with different conditions in terms of team members\u2019 capabilities and task characteristics for them to exhibit their decision-making strategies.

To fill the gap, we aim to study contrastive learning on the wearable-based activity recognition task. Specifically, we conduct an in-depth study of contrastive learning from both algorithmic-level and task-level perspectives. For algorithmic-level analysis, we decompose contrastive models into several key components and conduct rigorous experimental evaluations to better understand the efficacy and rationale behind contrastive learning. More importantly, for task-level analysis, we show that the wearable-based signals bring unique challenges and opportunities to existing contrastive\u00a0\u2026", "The behaviors of deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously resistant to human interpretations. In this paper, we propose Hypergradient Data Relevance Analysis, or HyDRA, which interprets the predictions made by DNNs as effects of their training data. Existing approaches generally estimate data contributions around the final model parameters and ignore how the training data shape the optimization trajectory. By unrolling the hypergradient of test loss wrt the weights of training data, HyDRA assesses the contribution of training data toward test data points throughout the training trajectory. In order to accelerate computation, we remove the Hessian from the calculation and prove that, under moderate conditions, the approximation error is bounded. Corroborating this theoretical claim, empirical results indicate the error is indeed small. In addition, we quantitatively demonstrate that HyDRA outperforms influence functions in accurately estimating data contribution and detecting noisy data labels.

To use machine learning techniques for sensor-based activity recognition, previous approaches focused on composing a feature vector to represent sensor-reading streams received within a period of various lengths. With the constructed feature vectors, eg, using predefined orders of moments in statistics, and their corresponding labels of activities, standard classification algorithms can be applied to train a predictive model, which will be used to make predictions online. However, we argue that in this way some important information, eg, statistical information captured by higher-order moments, may be discarded when constructing features. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method, denoted by SMMAR, based on learning from distributions for sensor-based activity recognition. Specifically, we consider sensor readings received within a period as a sample, which can be represented by a feature vector of infinite dimensions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using kernel embedding techniques. We then train a classifier in the RKHS. To scale-up the proposed method, we further offer an accelerated version by utilizing an explicit feature map instead of using a kernel function. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.", "Weak supervisory information of web images, such as captions, tags, and descriptions, make it possible to better understand images at the semantic level.

Compared with existing studies, OMC-ART has several distinct characteristics. First, OMC-ART is able to perform online learning of sequential data. Second, OMC-ART builds a two-layer indexing structure, in which the first layer co-indexes the images by the key visual and textual features based on the generalized distributions of clusters they belong to; while in the second layer, images are co-indexed by their own feature distributions.

Besides the user-item interaction graph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (e.g., user-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations of users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and aggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be prohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs.

Experimental results suggest that the proposed strategy achieved more favorable negotiation outcomes as compared with the general strategy.", "In this paper, we present the probabilistic fuzzy cognitive map (PFCM) which is a novel extension of FCM theory.

A formalized inference process of PFCMs is presented for adjustments on probability of fuzzy events and for dynamic update of causal weights. This enables PFCM to synthetically analyze the impacts of randomness and fuzziness on causal inference process. The simulation result shows a good match to the above features of PFCM.

The diagnosis of DR through eye fundus images is traditionally performed by ophthalmologists who inspect for the presence and significance of many subtle features, a process which is cumbersome and time-consuming. As there are many undiagnosed and untreated cases of DR, DR screening of all diabetic patients is a huge challenge. Some previous works have applied deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to detect DR automatically. However, these methods employed very deep CNNs which require extensive computational resources.

Specifically, we extract six statistical features from raw EEG signals and apply a simple yet cost-effective feature smoothing method to improve the recognition accuracy. The experimental results on the well-known DEAP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

It is especially suitable for consensus tasks which collect opinions from human workers to gain insight into real-world phenomena. In these tasks, motivating workers to provide their truthful opinions is a challenging problem. Most existing incentive mechanisms proposed to address this problem assume that workers share a common prior. However, this assumption is not always valid in practice, resulting in that the existing approaches may discourage workers to provide their truthful opinions. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism -- iMET -- to elicit truthful opinions for crowdsourced multiple-choice consensus tasks. By incorporating the concepts of worker credibility and similarity, iMET rewards workers for providing truthful opinions without assuming a common prior\u00a0\u2026", "Truthful bidding is a desirable property for continuous double auctions (CDAs). Many incentive mechanisms have been proposed to elicit truthful bids. However, existing truthful CDA mechanisms often overlook the possibility that sellers may choose not to deliver the auctioned items to buyers as promised. In this situation, buyers may become unwilling to bid their true valuations in the future to compensate for their risks of being cheated, thereby rendering CDAs ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation-aware CDA (named RCDA) mechanism to consider the honesty of auction participants. It dynamically adjusts bids and asks according to the reputation of participants to reflect the risks involved in the transactions. Theoretical analysis proves that RCDA is effective in eliciting truthful bids from buyers and sellers in the presence of possible dishonest behavior from both buyers and sellers.", "This paper describes ongoing learning and intelligent agent research involving a new class of educational Interactive and Digital Media (IDM) that integrates computational intelligent agents with the functionality and affordances of 3D Multi-User Virtual Environment (MUVE).

In this paper, we propose a model, namely Evolutionary Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM), to model the dynamic causal relationships among different context variables. As an extension to conventional FCM, E-FCM models not only the fuzzy causal relationships among the variables, but also the probabilistic property of causal relationships, and asynchronous activity update of the concepts. With this model, the context variables evolve in a dynamic and uncertain manner with the according evolving time. As a result, the virtual world is presented more realistically and dynamically.", "Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is gaining acceptance in many application domains as a way to structure system for flexibility and for better alignment with business goals. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are suited to digital ecosystems for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) because they allow each service client machine to act also as a service provider. There is no large enterprise that acts as a central hub in the network of business relationships. SMEs organize themselves in complex web of dynamic inter-relationships within the digital ecosystem. Most present P2P system had been designed with a fixed infrastructure in mind rather than a wireless or mobile infrastructure.

Interest based negotiation allows negotiators to discuss the concerns behind the negotiation issues so that a mutually acceptable win-win solution is more likely to be reached. This paper, for the first time, proposes a computational model for interest based negotiation automation which enables the automation of the fundamental elements of negotiation. Based on the model, algorithms are designated to automate the fundamental elements with practical computational complexity. This model provides not only a theoretical foundation for software agent based negotiation automation, but also a practical approach.", "GUI regression testing is challenging as GUIs are changed frequently during the whole SDLC. Currently, there are no effective techniques for doing GUI regression testing. In this paper, a novel actionable knowledge model (AKM) is proposed for representing GUI test cases.

An intriguing yet challenging problem arises: Can generative models achieve counterfactual editing against their learnt priors? Due to the lack of counterfactual samples in natural datasets, we investigate this problem in a text-driven manner with Contrastive-Language-Image-Pretraining (CLIP), which can offer rich semantic knowledge even for various counterfactual concepts. Different from in-domain manipulation, counterfactual manipulation requires more comprehensive exploitation of semantic knowledge encapsulated in CLIP as well as more delicate handling of editing directions for avoiding being stuck in local minimum or undesired editing. To this end, we design a novel contrastive loss that exploits predefined CLIP-space\u00a0\u2026", "The development of smart vehicles and rich cloud services have led to the emergence of vehicular edge computing.

Specifically, the vehicles use the PolyDot codes to manage the tradeoff between communication costs and recovery threshold. Given the requirements of various vehicles, the double auction mechanism matches the edge servers with the required resources to the vehicles. Besides, the double auction mechanism also determines the prices that the vehicles need to pay for the resources of the edge servers.

Due to the openness of crowdsourcing, dynamic online workers with different knowledge backgrounds might give conflicting labels to a task. With the assumption that workers provide their labels independently, most existing works aggregate worker labels in a voting manner, which is vulnerable to Sybil attack where the attacker earns easy rewards by coordinating several Sybil workers to share a randomized label on each task for dominating the aggregation result. A strategic Sybil attacker also attempts to evade Sybil detection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called TDSSA (Truth Discovery against Strategic Sybil Attack), to defend against strategic Sybil attack.

However, most studies in skin cancer detection keep pursuing high prediction accuracies without considering the limitation of computing resources on portable devices. In this case, the knowledge distillation (KD) method has been proven as an efficient tool to help improve the adaptability of lightweight models under limited resources, meanwhile keeping a high-level representation capability.

In this paper, we propose a semantic-based energy valuation and take an economic approach to solve the energy allocation problem as an incentive mechanism design. In our model, IoT devices (bidders) place their bids for the energy and power transmitter (auctioneer) decides the winner and payment by using deep learning based optimal auction. Results show that the revenue of wireless power transmitter is maximized while satisfying Individual Rationality (IR) and Incentive Compatibility (IC).", "Relation extraction aims to predict a semantic relation between entities in a sentence, which is usually regarded as a classification problem. However, due to the limited relation set, many semantic relations are labeled as a special artificial relation type, termed , if they are beyond the predefined relation set. Existing methods treat this artificial relation type  as a common semantic relation without taking its rich semantics into account. In this paper, a novel auxiliary learning method is proposed to excavate the semantic information of , resulting in the improvement of generalization performance. The auxiliary learning method focuses on the model learning phase and introduces a binary classification task that treats the artificial relation type  as negative class and the rest semantic types as positive class.

Buyer agents can benefit from modeling the reputation of seller agents to make a decision on which seller to have transaction with. However, the existence of unfair ratings decreases the accuracy of the seller agents' reputation evaluation, which will lead to inappropriate sellers to be selected and hence harm buyers' profits. In this paper, to address the problem of unfair ratings, we propose a witness trustworthiness model based on Dempster-Shafer theory to evaluate the trustworthiness of a witness's ratings regarding a particular seller. The proposed approach uses local and global ratings together to model a witness's trustworthiness which is specific for different sellers.

This paper proposes a contract theory-based FL task training model toward minimizing the incentive budget subject to clients being individually rational and incentive compatible in each FL training round. We design a two-dimensional contract model by formally defining two private types of clients, namely data quality and computation effort. To effectively aggregate the trained models, a contract-based aggregator is proposed.

Virtual services, ranging from virtual driver training to online route optimization for smart goods delivery, are emerging in the Metaverse. To make the human experience of virtual life more real, digital twins (DTs), namely digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. However, DT status may not always accurately reflect that of its real-world twin because the latter may be subject to changes with time. As such, it is necessary to synchronize a DT with its physical counterpart to ensure that its status is accurate for virtual businesses in the Metaverse. In this paper, we propose a dynamic hierarchical framework in which a group of IoT devices is incentivized to sense and collect physical objects' status information collectively so as to assists virtual service providers (VSPs) in synchronizing DTs. Based on the collected sensing data and the value decay rate of the DTs, the VSPs can determine synchronization intensities to maximize their payoffs. In our proposed dynamic hierarchical framework, the lower-level evolutionary game captures the VSPs selection by the IoT device population, and the upper-level differential game captures the VSPs payoffs, which are affected by the synchronization strategy, IoT devices selections, and the DTs value status, given VSPs are simultaneous decision makers. We further consider the case in which some VSPs are first movers and extend it as a Stackelberg differential game. We theoretically and experimentally show that the equilibrium to the lower-level game exists and is evolutionarily robust, and provide a sensitivity analysis with\u00a0\u2026", "Cognitive inhibition, a key constituent of healthy cognition, has been shown to be susceptible to age-related cognitive declines.

We propose a generalized latent optimization strategy that allows different losses to accommodate each other and improves training dynamics. The proposed method outperforms transfer learning and meta-learning baselines. In particular, we achieve 10.02% absolute performance gain over the previous state of the art on the iSarcasm dataset.", "Recently, automatic image caption generation has been an important focus of the work on  multimodal  translation task.

We evaluate the correlations between these five sub-constructs and familiarity through a field study involving 59 Singaporean older adults. Four exergames designed with different interfaces and tasks were sequentially played by the participants.

Currently, social information has mainly been utilized for enhancing rating prediction accuracy, which may not be enough to satisfy user needs. Items with high prediction accuracy tend to be the ones that users are familiar with and may not interest them to explore. In this paper, we take a psychologically inspired view to recommend items that will interest users based on the theory of social curiosity and study its impact on important dimensions of recommender systems. We propose a social curiosity inspired recommendation model which combines both user preferences and user curiosity. The proposed recommendation model is evaluated using large scale real world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of social curiosity significantly improves recommendation precision, coverage and diversity.", "Using an affective agent to estimate humans\u2019 composite emotions is important for creating believable interactions in human-agent collectives.

Existing social trust models often utilize rating similarity between different agents to calculate how much they should trust each other. However, when a new truster enters the MAS and has not provided sufficient number of ratings, existing approaches cannot effectively advise the truster on which other agents can be trusted.

To remedy these issues, we first reformulate the conversational recommendation task to highlight that the recommended items should be new and possibly interested by users. Then, we propose the Knowledge-Enriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS). Specifically, we develop the Bag-of-Entity (BOE) loss and the infusion loss to better integrate KG with CRS for generating more diverse and informative responses. BOE loss provides an additional supervision signal to guide CRS to learn from both human-written utterances and KG. Infusion loss bridges the gap between the word embeddings and entity embeddings by minimizing distances of the same words in these two embeddings. Moreover, we facilitate our study by constructing a high-quality KG, \\ie The Movie Domain Knowledge Graph (TMDKG).

The anchor points in APC are characterized by having a relatively large distance from data points with higher densities. We take anchor points as centers to obtain intermediate clusters, which can divide the whole dataset more appropriately so as to better facilitate further grouping. In essence, based on the analysis of the identified anchor points, the relationship among the corresponding intermediate clusters can be better revealed.

As such, DPC may confine in forming low-density data clusters, or in other words, DPC may fail in detecting anomalies and borderline points. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of DPC and propose a novel density peak clustering algorithm to better handle low-density clustering tasks.

Findings The proposed approach was implemented in a computerized test application called iTMT. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate iTMT. The results show that the instances of TMT generated by the DAC approach had an adequate level of difficulty. iTMT also achieved a stronger construct validity, higher test-retest reliability and significantly reduced practice effects than existing computerized tests.

With the motivation of developing human-like intelligence, in this paper, we delineate our approach to enable an agent to maintain memories of its own and to wander in mind. Our model, named Autobiographical Memory-Adaptive Resonance Theory network (AM-ART), is designed to capture autobiographical memories, comprising pictorial snapshots of one\u2019s life experiences together with the associated context, namely time, location, people, activity, and emotion. In terms of both network structure and dynamics, AM-ART coincides with the autobiographical memory model established by the psychologists, which has been supported by neural imaging evidence. Specifically, the bottomup memory search and the top-down memory readout operations of AM-ART replicate how the brain encodes and retrieves autobiographical memories. Furthermore, the wandering in reminiscence function of AM-ART mimics how human wanders in mind. For evaluations, we conducted experiments on a data set collected from the public domain to test the performance of AM-ART in response to exact, partial, and noisy memory retrieval cues. Moreover, our statistical analysis shows that AM-ART can simulate the phenomenon of wandering in reminiscence.", "Recently, 3D caricature generation and applications have attracted wide attention from both the research community and the entertainment industry. This paper proposes a novel interactive approach for various and interesting 3D caricature generation based on double sampling. Firstly, according to user's operation, we obtain a coarse 3D caricature with local features transformation by sampling in well-built principle component analysis (PCA) subspace. Secondly, to utilize information of the 2D caricature dataset, we sample in the local linear embedding (LLE) manifold subspace. Finally, we use the learned 2D caricature information to further refine the coarse caricature by applying Kriging interpolation. The experiments show that the 3D caricature generated by our method can preserve highly artistic styles and also reflect the user's intention.", "For wireless transmission, the assumption that the transmitter always obtains the channel state information (CSI) is unreasonable because of feedback delays, estimation error and quantization error. When the transmitter can\u2019t receive the channel state information perfectly, the performance of the wireless systems will degrade. Some prescribed quality of service (QoS) requirements will not be satisfied. In order to avoid the system\u2019s degradation, a more concrete analysis of wireless transmission under imperfect CSI is needed. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technique for improving the spectrum efficiency in future wireless network. In this paper, the downlink transmission based on partial channel state information due to feedback delays in a multiuser Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (MU-OFDM) based CR system is investigated. We analyze the impact of partial channel state information on the wireless transmission. A new transmission schedule is derived based on obtained partial CSI. Simulation results show that the new transmission schedule satisfies the given QoS while achieving high data rate. The more the partial CSI is correlated to the real CSI, the higher data rate is achieved.", "Personalization in virtual learning environments is the system ability to provide individualization and a set of personalized services such as personalized content management, learner model, or adaptive instant interaction.

Given that the FL network is expected to be implemented at scale, several studies have proposed system architectures towards improving the network scalability and efficiency. Specifically, the Hierarchical FL (HFL) network utilizes cluster heads, e.g., base stations, for the intermediate aggregation and relay of model parameters. Serverless FL is also proposed recently, in which the data owners, i.e., workers, exchange the local model parameters among a neighborhood of workers. This decentralized approach reduces the risk of a single point of failure but inevitably incurs significant communication overheads.

However, many existing activity recognition applications or experiments using wearable sensors were conducted in the confined laboratory settings using specifically developed gadgets. These gadgets may be useful for a small group of people in certain specific scenarios, but probably will not gain their popularity because they introduce additional costs and they are unusual in everyday life. Alternatively, commercial devices such as smart phones and smart watches can be better utilized for robust activity recognitions.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable RSL framework named OMTRSL (Online Multi-Task Relative Similarity Learning).

However, due to the huge volume of the collected data by IoT devices (e.g., images and videos) and the limited bandwidth, the VSP might become unable to retrieve all the required data from the physical world. Furthermore, the Metaverse needs fast replication (e.g., rendering) of the digital copy adding more restrictions on the data transmission delay.

The prevalent success of existing methods, however, has two crucial prerequisites: proper feature extraction and sufficient labeled training data. The former is important to differentiate activities, while the latter is crucial to build a precise learning model. These two prerequisites have become bottlenecks to make existing methods more practical. Most existing feature extraction methods highly depend on domain knowledge, while labeled data requires intensive human annotation effort. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method, named Distribution-based Semi-Supervised Learning, to tackle the aforementioned limitations. The proposed method is capable of automatically extracting powerful features with no domain knowledge required, meanwhile, alleviating the heavy annotation effort through semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we treat data stream of sensor readings received in a period as a distribution, and map all training distributions, including labeled and unlabeled, into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using the kernel mean embedding technique. The RKHS is further altered by exploiting the underlying geometry structure of the unlabeled distributions. Finally, in the altered RKHS, a classifier is trained with the labeled distributions.

C-ELM follows the psychological theory of curiosity proposed by Berlyne and performs curiosity appraisal towards each input data based on four collative variables: novelty, uncertainty, conflict, and surprise. The collative variables reflect the level of curiosity stimulation in the input data. Based on the level of curiosity stimulation, the network decides on the strategies for learning, including neuron addition, neuron deletion, and parameter update. During neuron addition, a new neuron is added based on the input data, thereby reducing the randomization effect of\u00a0\u2026", "\u76ee\u7684 \u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd1 3 \u5e74\u5317\u4eac\u534f\u548c\u533b\u9662\u8840\u6db2\u79d1\u60a3\u8005\u7ec6\u83cc\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u70b9. \u65b9\u6cd5 \u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790 2010 \u81f3 2012 \u5e74\u5317\u4eac\u534f\u548c\u533b\u9662\u8840\u6db2\u79d1\u75c5\u623f\u6240\u6709\u9001\u68c0\u7684\u6807\u672c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9633\u6027\u7ec6\u83cc\u57f9\u517b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8d44\u6599, \u4e86\u89e3\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u75c5\u539f\u83cc\u5206\u5e03, \u90e8\u4f4d, \u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001, \u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u53ca\u8f6c\u5f52. \u7ed3\u679c \u5171\u68c0\u51fa\u9633\u6027\u81f4\u75c5\u7ec6\u83cc 388 \u4f8b\u6b21, \u5360\u6240\u6709\u9001\u68c0\u6807\u672c\u7684 5.8%. \u5176\u4e2d\u793e\u533a\u611f\u67d3\u5360 8.4%, \u4ee5\u9769\u5170\u9634\u6027\u83cc\u4e3a\u4e3b (75%), \u65e0\u8010\u836f\u83cc\u51fa\u73b0. \u9662\u5185\u611f\u67d3\u5360 91.6%, \u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u611f\u67d3\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e3a\u547c\u5438\u9053 (49.4%), \u8840\u6d41 (32.6%), \u76ae\u80a4\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7 (10.4%) \u53ca\u6ccc\u5c3f\u7cfb (3.7%), \u75c5\u539f\u83cc\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u9769\u5170\u9634\u6027\u83cc\u4e3a\u4e3b (66.9%), \u6700\u591a\u89c1\u7684\u9769\u5170\u9634\u6027\u83cc\u4e3a\u5927\u80a0\u57c3\u5e0c\u83cc (13.8%), \u94dc\u7eff\u5047\u5355\u80de\u83cc (12.1%) \u53ca\u80ba\u708e\u514b\u96f7\u4f2f\u83cc (12.1%), \u6700\u591a\u89c1\u7684\u9769\u5170\u9633\u6027\u83cc\u4e3a\u91d1\u9ec4\u8272\u8461\u8404\u7403\u83cc (10.4%), \u5c4e\u80a0\u7403\u83cc (7.0%) \u53ca\u8868\u76ae\u8461\u8404\u7403\u83cc (5.1%). \u547c\u5438\u9053, \u8840\u6d41\u611f\u67d3\u83cc\u4ee5\u9769\u5170\u9634\u6027\u83cc\u4e3a\u4e3b, \u76ae\u80a4\u521b\u9762\u53ca\u809b\u5468\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u611f\u67d3\u5219\u4ee5\u9769\u5170\u9633\u6027\u83cc\u611f\u67d3\u4e3a\u4e3b. \u5728\u9769\u5170\u9633\u6027\u83cc\u548c\u9769\u5170\u9634\u6027\u83cc\u4e2d, \u5747\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u8010\u836f\u83cc. \u591a\u6570\u60a3\u8005 (68.1%) \u5904\u4e8e\u7c92\u7ec6\u80de\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ca\u514d\u75ab\u6291\u5236\u72b6\u6001. 22 \u4f8b (71.9%) \u60a3\u8005\u7ecf\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u611f\u67d3\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u6548\u00a0\u2026", "Co-Space refers to interactive virtual environment modelled after the real world in terms of look-and-feel, functionalities and services.

The agent\u2019s goals are identified and organized in a composite goal hierarchy. Three kinds of relations between goals are defined: choice, concurrency and synchronization. Actions between goals are designed to accomplish subsequent goals. The agent\u2019s desire is satisfied by accomplishing a serial of intermediary goals and finally achieving the ultimate goal that is satisfying the desire. The agent\u2019s action plan is a list of actions to accomplish the intermediary goals in the solution. Because Goal Net is designed by considering agent\u2019s possible desires directly, this bridges the distance between BDI agent design and the planning system. A searching algorithm is proposed to select goals in Goal Net. A case study of e-learning agent is shown to demonstrate the planning system.", "Semantic interoperability is one of the key challenges in integrating disparate design software systems.

However, existing attempts to establish reputation systems in the grid mainly focus on enabling reputation evaluation to measure the resource providers' reliability, but do not effectively address the inaccurate testimonies and malicious referrers, which generally deteriorate the performance of reputation systems. Against this background, this paper proposes a reputation system with the ability to mitigate the influence of the inaccurate testimonies and malicious referrers.

Different from existing SSL solutions that overlook the role of \"class\" in causing the non-randomness, e.g., users are more likely to label popular classes, we explicitly incorporate \"class\" into SSL. Our method is three-fold: 1) We propose Class-Aware Propensity (CAP) that exploits the unlabeled data to train an improved classifier using the biased labeled data. 2) To encourage rare class training, whose model is low-recall but high-precision that discards too many pseudo-labeled data, we propose Class-Aware Imputation (CAI) that dynamically decreases (or increases) the pseudo-label assignment threshold for rare (or frequent) classes. 3) Overall, we integrate CAP and CAI into a Class-Aware Doubly Robust (CADR) estimator for training an unbiased SSL model. Under various MNAR settings and ablations, our method not only significantly outperforms existing baselines but also surpasses other label bias removal SSL methods.

However, they typically require skeletal pre-modeling and label information for training, which leads to limited applicability of these methods. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised skeleton-based person re-ID, and present a generic Simple Masked Contrastive learning (SimMC) framework to learn effective representations from unlabeled 3D skeletons for person re-ID. Specifically, to fully exploit skeleton features within each skeleton sequence, we first devise a masked prototype contrastive learning (MPC) scheme to cluster the most typical skeleton features (skeleton prototypes) from different subsequences randomly masked from raw sequences, and contrast the inherent similarity between skeleton features and different prototypes to learn discriminative skeleton representations without using any label. Then, considering that different subsequences within the same sequence usually enjoy strong correlations due to the nature of motion continuity, we propose the masked intra-sequence contrastive learning (MIC) to capture intra-sequence pattern consistency between subsequences, so as to encourage learning more effective skeleton representations for person re-ID. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed SimMC outperforms most state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods. We further show its scalability and efficiency in enhancing the performance of existing models.

LEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale neighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive regularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the data distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be computed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural recommendation models.

Since label quality depends on the expertise of annotators to a large extent, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Automatically generating labels from click-through data has been well studied to have comparable or better performance than human judges. Click-through data present users\u2019 action and imply their satisfaction on search results, but exclude the interactions between users and search results beyond the page-view level (eg, eye and mouse movements). This paper proposes a novel approach to comprehensively consider the information underlying mouse trajectory and click-through data so as to describe user behaviors more objectively and achieve a better understanding of the user experience. By integrating multi-sources data, the proposed approach reveals that the relevance labels of query-url pairs are related to positions of urls and users\u2019 behavioral features. Based on their correlations, query-url pairs can be labeled more accurately and search results are more satisfactory to users.

Due to the black-box nature of cloud models, however, a vast number of queries are inevitably required by existing attack strategies before the substitute model achieves high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel simple yet efficient querying strategy to greatly enhance the querying efficiency to steal a classification model. This is motivated by our observation that current querying strategies suffer from decision boundary\u00a0\u2026", "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained wide research interests due to their technological advancement and high mobility. The UAVs are equipped with increasingly advanced capabilities to run computationally intensive applications enabled by machine learning techniques. However, because of both energy and computation constraints, the UAVs face issues hovering in the sky while performing computation due to weather uncertainty. To overcome the computation constraints, the UAVs can partially or fully offload their computation tasks to the edge servers. In ordinary computation offloading operations, the UAVs can retrieve the result from the returned output. Nevertheless, if the UAVs are unable to retrieve the entire result from the edge servers, i.e., straggling edge servers, this operation will fail. In this article, we propose a coded distributed computing (CDC) approach for computation offloading to mitigate\u00a0\u2026", "Counterfactual explanations are minimum changes of a given input to alter the original prediction by a machine learning model, usually from an undesirable prediction to a desirable one. Previous works frame this problem as a constrained cost minimization, where the cost is defined as L1/L2 distance (or variants) over multiple features to measure the change. In real-life applications, features of different types are hardly comparable and it is difficult to measure the changes of heterogeneous features by a single cost function. Moreover, existing approaches do not support interactive exploration of counterfactual explanations. To address above issues, we propose the skyline counterfactual explanations that define the skyline of counterfactual explanations as all non-dominated changes. We solve this problem as multi-objective optimization over actionable features. This approach does not require any cost function over\u00a0\u2026", "In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm, a model owner is able to leverage on the enhanced capabilities of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICV) to develop promising Artificial Intelligence (AI) based applications, e.g., for traffic efficiency. However, in some cases, a model owner may have insufficient data samples to build an effective AI model. To this end, we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based privacy preserving approach to facilitate collaborative FL among multiple model owners in the IoV. Our system model enables collaborative model training without compromising data privacy given that only the model parameters instead of the raw data are exchanged within the federation. However, there are two main challenges of incentive mismatches between workers and model owners, as well as among model owners. For the former, we leverage on the self-revealing mechanism in contract theory under\u00a0\u2026", "The process of arguing is also the process of justifying and explaining. Here, we focus on argumentative explanations in Abstract Bipolar Argumentation. We propose new defence and acceptability semantics, which operates on both attack and support relations, and use them to formalize two types of explanations, concise and strong explanations. We also show how to compute the explanations with Bipolar Dispute Trees.", "Rehabilitation exercises aim to help the elderly recover their deteriorating capabilities. Due to the advance in multimedia technologies, rehabilitation exergames are emerging and become more accessible for the elderly. Most existing exergames cannot adapt to specific individual's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic based computational personenvironment fit model to bridge this gap. As such, unprofessional personnel who are in charge of the assignments of the exergame sessions, such as volunteers in community centres, may learn the usefulness of the particular exergames to the individual elderly. We also provide case studies to analyze the adaptive level of three exergames for five elder Singaporeans to illustrate the application of our proposed model.", "Rehabilitation exergames can engage the elderly in physical activities and help them recover part of their deteriorating capabilities. However, most existing exergames lack measures of how suitable they are to specific individuals. In this paper, we propose the Computational Person-Environment Fit model to evaluate the adaptability of the exergames to each individual elderly user.", "Team formation with realistic crowd simulation behaviour is a challenge in computer graphics, multi-agent control and social simulation. In this paper, we propose a framework of crowd formation via hierarchical planning, which includes cooperative-task, coordinated-behaviour and action-control planning. In cooperative-task planning, we improve the grid potential field to achieve global path planning for a team. In coordinated-behaviour planning, we propose a time-space table to arrange behaviour scheduling for a movement. In action-control planning, we combine the gaze-movement angle model and fuzzy logic control to achieve agent action. Our method has several advantages: (1) The hierarchical architecture is guaranteed to match the human decision process from high to low intelligence. (2) The agent plans his behaviour only with the local information of his neighbour; the global intelligence of the group\u00a0\u2026", "Algorithmic Crowdsourcing (AC) is an emerging field in which computational methods are proposed to automate cer-tain aspects of crowdsourcing. A number of AC methods have proposed recently in an attempt to address this problem. However, existing AC approaches are based on highly simplified models of worker behaviour which limit their practical applicability. To make efficient utilization of human resources for crowdsourcing tasks, the following tech-nical challenges remain open: Fairness of the solution, temporal changes in behaviour, optimizing wellbeing, and non-compliance by users. For AI researchers to propose effective solutions to these challenges, labelled datasets reflecting various aspects of human decision-making related to task allocation in crowd-sourcing are needed. We construct an anonymized dataset based on player behavior trajectories captured by a multiagent game platform-Agile Manage. It allows players to demonstrate their task delegation strategies under different scenarios based on key characteristics involved in crowdsourcing task allocation. The game adopts implicit human computation in which players contribute data which are valuable for research through informal games.", "With the growing and aging population, health deterioration has also been on the rise especially in elderly group. This would then impact the daily living of one. Thus there is a need to look into how than can technology aid elderly in living apart from having to burden family members. In this research, we will want to look into classifying serious games and to find out what are the key principles needed to be designed for elderly.There two main objectives of this survey. Firstly it is to understand how the serious gaming can help elderly to improve their life also aiding them to regain cognitive functions which was impaired by certain diseases or deterioration due to age. Secondly to suggest a Taxonomy of Serious Game for Elderly in order to dismiss any myth or misconception about the characteristics of such games so that they can deliver the result effectively to elderly.", "Taxi service is an important mode of modern public transportation. However, operated by a large number of selfcontrolled and profit-driven taxi drivers, taxi systems are quite in efficient and difficult to analyze and regulate. While there has been some work on designing algorithms for improving taxi system efficiency, the state of the art algorithm, unfortunately, cannot scale up efficiently. To address the inadequacy, we propose a novel algorithm\u2014FLORA\u2014in this paper. Using convex polytope representation conversion techniques, FLORA provides a fully compact representation of taxi drivers\u2019 strategy space, and avoids enumerating any type of schedules. Experimental results show orders of magnitude improvement of FLORA in terms of the complexity.", "Teachable agents are pedagogical agents based on the concept of learning-by-teaching. Persuasion theory enhances the capabilities of teachable agents by influencing positive attitude change in learners. This paper proposes Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) that enables the selection of persuasive strategies based on persuasion theory to improve learning attitudes. In a preliminary study involving PTA, learners were observed to display increased interest in engaging in learning activities with the teachable agent.", "The problem of unfair testimonies remains to be a big concern in reputation systems. To address this problem, we propose a witness trustworthiness model based on Dempster-Shafer theory for reputation systems using multi-nominal testimonies. The proposed approach uses Dempster-Shafer theory to model a witness\u2019s trustworthiness from both personal and public aspects. Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results of the proposed approach in modeling witnesses\u2019 trustworthiness and adapting to the buyer specified subjective difference tolerance level.", "A new sliding mode control technique for a class of SISO dynamic systems is presented in this chapter. It is seen that the stability status of the closed-loop system is first checked, based on the approximation of the most recent information of the first-order derivative of the Lyapunov function of the closed-loop system, an intelligent sliding mode controller can then be designed with the following intelligent features: (i) If the closed-loop system is stable, the correction term in the controller will continuously adjust control signal to drive the closed-loop trajectory to reach the sliding mode surface in a finite time and the desired closed-loop dynamics with the zero-error convergence can then be achieved on the sliding mode surface. (ii) If, however, the closed-loop system is unstable, the correction term is capable of modifying the control signal to continuously reduce the value of the derivative of the Lyapunov function\u00a0\u2026", "In current search engines, ranking functions are learned from a large number of labeled< query, URL> pairs in which the labels are assigned by human judges, describing how well the URLs match the different queries. However in commercial search engines, collecting high quality labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To tackle this issue, this paper studies how to produce the true relevance labels for< query, URL> pairs using clickthrough data. By analyzing the correlations between query frequency, true relevance labels and users\u2019 behaviors, we demonstrate that the users who search the queries with similar frequency have similar search intents and behavioral characteristics. Based on such properties, we propose an efficient discriminative parameter estimation in a multiple instance learning algorithm (MIL) to automatically produce true relevance labels for< query, URL> pairs. Furthermore, we test our approach using a set of real world data extracted from a Chinese commercial search engine. Experimental results not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but also indicate that our approach is more likely to agree with the aggregation of the multiple judgments when strong disagreements exist in the panel of judges. In the event that the panel of judges is consensus, our approach provides more accurate automatic label results. In contrast with other models, our approach effectively improves the correlation between automatic labels and manual labels.", "A lot of researches haven been done on the interactive storytelling authoring, e.g. by a director agent, or by interactions among a number of character agents. However, it is still difficult to construct the interactive storytelling for novice users, due to a need of various agents development and complex communication among the agents. We propose an agent-based interactive storytelling architecture, namely DIRACT (short of \"Direct and Act\"). It is composed of numerous atomic DIRACT agents, which are goal oriented and use an unified communication protocol. By removing the difference between the director and character, each DIRACT agent can either direct or act the story in real-time. As a result, it is scalable to story complexity, reusable for inheritance and makes the interactive storytelling authoring much easier.", "Personalization is a key issue in adaptive virtual learning environments, which support interactiveengagement methods for learners. Recently there has been much progress on advanced graphical interfaces, but more progress is needed to fine tune and adapt such interfaces to end-user's abilities and preferences. One of the emerging challenges in such an adaptive multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) is the development of personalized services such as personalized content management, user-models, or adaptive instant interaction. This paper uses agent technology as an effective framework for developing personalized services in a MUVE. The proposed framework is validated by applying it to Virtual Singapura (VS), an agent augmented virtual environment designed to engage and motivate learners at the lower secondary level in Singapore as they learn important scientific knowledge and skills.", "Pedagogical agents have made significant strides over the past few years as a new species of learning technologies. This paper is a review on the current state of the art in pedagogical agents, believability and human-likeness, and instructional affordance of the autonomous agents in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. It reviews the challenges that concern pedagogical agents, and proposes research and technology development activities that can allow for learner-oriented intelligent efforts.", "Computer Science students are not only interested in playing games but also highly motivated to learn how games are developed. This paper proposes a novel agent augmented game development framework in a 3D virtualized environment that allows students to become the players, the situated learners and the designers, who create games/stories in an immersive 3D environment, simultaneously.Unlike most of existing games in which agents are designed to play some roles or to execute specific tasks, we augment the whole game world as an interactive multi-agent system. The agent intractability and autonomy enhance the user interactions and enable the dynamic story creation in a situated learning/playing environment. The proposed approach significantly increases the interests of students in learning to design the game from playing.", "Product sustainability approaches, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC), are becoming increasingly critical to influence product decisions for all lifecycle stages. However, LCA and LCC methods must be integrated into the product lifecycle processes for sharing their data semantics with other applications in order to support decisions in the technical, ecological and economic aspects of products. Semantics sharing has raised big challenges in understanding and interpreting the intended meaning of LCA, LCC and other product data. This paper presents an ontology-driven, standard-based approach to the explicit capture and reuse of product data semantics for heterogeneous information sharing across lifecycle processes in computer aided design, quality assurance, LCA and LCC analysis, and product development process management. The approach incorporates object-based\u00a0\u2026", "The rapid development of Artificial IntelligenceGenerated Content (AIGC) has brought daunting challenges regarding service latency, security, and trustworthiness. Recently, researchers presented the edge AIGC paradigm, effectively optimize the service latency by distributing AIGC services to edge devices. However, AIGC products are still unprotected and vulnerable to tampering and plagiarization. Moreover, as a kind of online non-fungible digital property, the free circulation of AIGC products is hindered by the lack of trustworthiness in open networks. In this article, for the first time, we present a blockchain-empowered framework to manage the lifecycle of edge AIGC products. Specifically, leveraging fraud proof, we first propose a protocol to protect the ownership and copyright of AIGC, called Proof-of-AIGC. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to guarantee the legitimate and timely executions of the funds-AIGC ownership exchanges among anonymous users. Furthermore, we build a multi-weight subjective logic-based reputation scheme, with which AIGC producers can determine which edge service provider is trustworthy and reliable to handle their services. Through numerical results, the superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated. Last but not least, we discuss important open directions for further research.", "This technical report briefly describes our JDExplore d-team's Vega v2 submission on the SuperGLUE leaderboard. SuperGLUE is more challenging than the widely used general language understanding evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, containing eight difficult language understanding tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, and reasoning. [Method] Instead of arbitrarily increasing the size of a pretrained language model (PLM), our aim is to 1) fully extract knowledge from the input pretraining data given a certain parameter budget, e.g., 6B, and 2) effectively transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. To achieve goal 1), we propose self-evolution learning for PLMs to wisely predict the informative tokens that should be masked, and supervise the masked language modeling (MLM) process with rectified smooth labels. For goal 2), we leverage the prompt transfer technique to improve the low-resource tasks by transferring the knowledge from the foundation model and related downstream tasks to the target task. [Results] According to our submission record (Oct. 2022), with our optimized pretraining and fine-tuning strategies, our 6B Vega method achieved new state-of-the-art performance on 4/8 tasks, sitting atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard on Oct. 8, 2022, with an average score of 91.3.", "Code search, which aims at retrieving the most relevant code fragment for a given natural language query, is a common activity in software development practice. Recently, contrastive learning is widely used in code search research, where many data augmentation approaches for source code (e.g., semantic-preserving program transformation) are proposed to learn better representations. However, these augmentations are at the raw-data level, which requires additional code analysis in the preprocessing stage and additional training costs in the training stage. In this paper, we explore augmentation methods that augment data (both code and query) at representation level which does not require additional data processing and training, and based on this we propose a general format of representation-level augmentation that unifies existing methods. Then, we propose three new augmentation methods (linear extrapolation, binary interpolation, and Gaussian scaling) based on the general format. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the advantages of the proposed augmentation methods over traditional contrastive learning methods on code search. We experimentally evaluate the proposed representation-level augmentation methods with state-of-the-art code search models on a large-scale public dataset consisting of six programming languages. The experimental results show that our approach can consistently boost the performance of the studied code search models. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Alex-HaochenLi/RACS.", "Computational understanding of humor is an important topic under creative language understanding and modeling. It can play a key role in complex human-AI interactions. The challenge here is that human perception of humorous content is highly subjective. The same joke may receive different funniness ratings from different readers. This makes it highly challenging for humor recognition models to achieve personalization in practical scenarios. Existing approaches are generally designed based on the assumption that users have a consensus on whether a given text is humorous or not. Thus, they cannot handle diverse humor preferences well. In this article, we propose the FedHumor approach for the recognition of humorous content in a personalized manner through Federated Learning (FL). Extending a pre-trained language model, FedHumor guides the fine-tuning process by considering diverse distributions\u00a0\u2026", "In reinforcement learning (RL), it is challenging to learn directly from high-dimensional observations, where data augmentation has recently been shown to remedy this via encoding invariances from raw pixels. Nevertheless, we empirically find that not all samples are equally important and hence simply injecting more augmented inputs may instead cause instability in Q-learning. In this paper, we approach this problem systematically by developing a model-agnostic Contrastive-Curiosity-Driven Learning Framework (CCLF), which can fully exploit sample importance and improve learning efficiency in a self-supervised manner. Facilitated by the proposed contrastive curiosity, CCLF is capable of prioritizing the experience replay, selecting the most informative augmented inputs, and more importantly regularizing the Q-function as well as the encoder to concentrate more on under-learned data. Moreover, it encourages the agent to explore with a curiosity-based reward. As a result, the agent can focus on more informative samples and learn representation invariances more efficiently, with significantly reduced augmented inputs. We apply CCLF to several base RL algorithms and evaluate on the DeepMind Control Suite, Atari, and MiniGrid benchmarks, where our approach demonstrates superior sample efficiency and learning performances compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "Argumentation has gained traction as a formalism to make more transparent decisions and provide formal explanations recently. In this paper, we present an argumentation-based approach to decision making that can support modelling and automated reasoning about complex qualitative preferences and offer dialogical explanations for the decisions made. We first propose Qualitative Preference Decision Frameworks (QPDFs). In a QPDF, we use contextual priority to represent the relative importance of combinations of goals in different contexts and define associated strategies for deriving decision preferences based on prioritized goal combinations. To automate the decision computation, we map QPDFs to Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) frameworks so that we can utilize existing ABA argumentative engines for our implementation. We implemented our approach for two tasks, diagnostics and prognostics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and evaluated it with real-world datasets. For each task, one of our models achieves the highest accuracy and good precision and recall for all classes compared to common machine learning models. Moreover, we study how to formalize argumentation dialogues that give contrastive, focused and selected explanations for the most preferred decisions selected in given contexts.", "Background A novel evidence-based Narrative e-Writing Intervention (NeW-I) has been developed and tested in Singapore to advance psychosociospiritual support for parents of children with chronic life-threatening illnesses. NeW-I is informed by an international systematic review and a Singapore-based qualitative inquiry on the lived experience of parental bereavement and supported by literature on anticipatory grief interventions for improving the holistic well-being of parent caregivers of seriously ill children. Objective This study's aim was to provide an accessible platform, NeW-I\u2014which is a strengths- and meaning-focused and therapist-facilitated mobile app and web-based counseling platform\u2014that aims to enhance quality of life, spiritual well-being, hope, and perceived social support and reduce depressive symptoms, caregiver burden, and risk of complicated grief among parents of children with chronic life-threatening illnesses. Methods The NeW-I therapist-facilitated web-based platform comprises a mobile app and a website (both of which have the same content and functionality). NeW-I has been implemented in Singapore as a pilot open-label randomized controlled trial comprising intervention and control groups. Both primary and secondary outcomes will be self-reported by participants through questionnaires. In collaboration with leading pediatric palliative care providers in Singapore, the trial aims to enroll 36 participants in each group (N=72), so that when allowing for 30% attrition at follow-up, the sample size will be adequate to detect a small effect size of 0.2 in the primary\u00a0\u2026", "Mobile data rewards is now leading a new economic trend in wireless networks, where the operators stimulate mobile users to view ads with data rewards and ask for corresponding payments from advertisers. Yet, due to the uncertain nature of users\u2019 preferences, it is always challenging for the advertiser to find the best choice of data rewards to attain an optimum balance between ad revenue and rewards spent. In this paper, we develop a general contract-theoretic framework to address the problem of data rewards design in a realistic asymmetric information scenario, where each user is associated with multidimensional private information. Specifically, we model the interplay between the advertiser and users by using a multidimensional contract design approach, and theoretically analyze optimal data rewarding schemes. To ensure global incentive compatibility, we convert the multi-dimensional contract problem\u00a0\u2026", "Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently been applied to exploit knowledge graph (KG) for recommendation. Existing GNN-based methods explicitly model the dependency between an entity and its local graph context in KG (i.e., the set of its first-order neighbors), but may not be effective in capturing its non-local graph context (i.e., the set of most related high-order neighbors). In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework, named Contextualized Graph Attention Network (CGAT), which can explicitly exploit both local and non-local graph context information of an entity in KG. Specifically, CGAT captures the local context information by a user-specific graph attention mechanism, considering a user's personalized preferences on entities. Moreover, CGAT employs a biased random walk sampling process to extract the non-local context of an entity, and utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the dependency between the entity and its non-local contextual entities. To capture the user's personalized preferences on items, an item-specific attention mechanism is also developed to model the dependency between a target item and the contextual items extracted from the user's historical behaviors. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CGAT, compared with state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods.", "Neurocomputational modelling of long-term memory is a core topic in computational cognitive neuroscience, which is essential towards self-regulating brain-like AI systems. In this paper, we study how people generally lose their memories and emulate various memory loss phenomena using a neurocomputational autobiographical memory model. Specifically, based on prior neurocognitive and neuropsychology studies, we identify three neural processes, namely overload, decay and inhibition, which lead to memory loss in memory formation, storage and retrieval, respectively. For model validation, we collect a memory dataset comprising more than one thousand life events and emulate the three key memory loss processes with model parameters learnt from memory recall behavioural patterns found in human subjects of different age groups. The emulation results show high correlation with human memory recall performance across their life span, even with another population not being used for learning. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research work on quantitative evaluations of autobiographical memory loss using a neurocomputational model.", "In e-commerce, recommendation is an essential feature to provide users with potentially interesting items to purchase. However, people are often faced with an unpleasant situation, where the recommended items are simply the ones similar to what they have purchased previously. One of the main reasons is that existing recommender systems in e-commerce mainly utilize primary implicit feedback (i.e., purchase history) for recommendation. Little attention has been paid to secondary implicit feedback (e.g., viewing items, adding items to shopping cart, adding items to favorite list, etc), which captures users' potential interests that may not be reflected in their purchase history. We therefore propose a personalized recommendation approach to combine the primary and secondary implicit feedback to generate the recommendation list, which is optimized towards a Bayesian objective criterion for personalized ranking\u00a0\u2026", "Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that the elderly are prone to. The recent statistics shows that PD threatens the living quality of over 10 million people worldwide and most of the patients are over 60 ages. Though some medications have been found to be effective in the management of disease progression, the conditions of patients\u2019 symptoms need to be monitored carefully to ensure the effectiveness of appropriate dosage of medications and other necessary treatments to be applied in case that the medications become less effective. Therefore, to facilitate patients and clinicians to have an objective assessment of the conditions of PD symptoms and monitor the effectiveness of treatment, we design a mobile game platform \u2013 Pumpkin Garden, which is able to encourage patients to assess their daily conditions through playing games.

The most important step to untwist the irrational thinking is identifying the forms of the cognitive distortion. The daily narration or diaries of the patients are always used by the cognitive-behavioral therapists as a clue to identify the cognitive distortion. But these natural language materials are always diverse and desultory which affect the efficiency and accuracy of identification. In this research, we propose a model called ICODLE (Identifying Cognitive Distortion by Deep Learning) which utilizes the daily narration or diaries of the patients to identify the forms of the cognitive distortion. ICODLE collect the daily narration and diaries from the authoritative books and webpages in CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) domain. Then ICODLE creates the database of the 10 forms of cognitive distortion which were defined by David D. Burns. By utilizing the advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., Word Embedding, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), etc.), ICODLE can identify the forms of the patients' cognitive distortions without the features extraction. ICODLE can effectively assist the patients and the cognitive-behavioral therapists to diagnose the cognitive distortions. ICODLE also benefit to build up the online persuasion system.", "Activity recognition is a key problem in multisensor systems. In a home-like environment, from several sensors of different types, the multi-sensor system identifies activities performed by the inhabitants. Many supervised learning techniques exist for solving this problem.

The proposed framework gives classification results comparable to pure learning based approaches with significantly reduced training time while giving argumentative explanations.", "Curiosity is an emotional motivation that drives knowledge acquisition in learning context. Studies have shown that curiosity positively influences social learning and a peer learner\u2019s curiosity may elicit the curiosity of other learners. Hence, modeling curiosity in learning companions may improve human learners\u2019 learning experience in virtual environments. However, curiosity has not been explored as one key personality trait in existing learning companions. In this paper, we propose a novel model of curiosity for learning companions to capture salient curiosity stimuli based on human psychology. Our model is based on Silvia\u2019s theory and considers three most salient appraisal variables in virtual learning environments, including novelty, surprise, and uncertainty.", "As an increasing percentage of the global population joining the elderly age group, more financial strain is being placed on health care institutions and governments worldwide. To alleviate this problem, it is necessary to involve volunteers with various skills and backgrounds to help serve part of the elderly\u2019s health care needs. Future health care service digital ecosystems have been envisioned to serve this purpose. However, there is a lack of management mechanisms for them that can holistically balance the goals of various stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a vision to face the challenge of health care service ecosystem from an interdisciplinary perspective. We propose a novel computational approach to simplify the problem of health care service ecosystem management and model it as a constraint optimization problem. By focusing on the stability and efficiency in usage health care information resources, the formulation articulates actionable objectives and constraints to make scalable and real-time solutions possible. Under such a vision, we discuss potential future research directions in the area of utility function formulation, game theoretic analysis and accommodating the special preferences of the elderly.", "In the age of the Internet, the elderly population may find it desirable to use online services. Unfortunately, many elderly users are not technically savvy and are vulnerable to malicious online service providers. Computational trust management systems may be a viable way to protect them, but the presence of collusion that corrupts the sources of information based on which many existing trust models make their recommendations poses a serious threat. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based trust agent that does not rely on sophisticated computations or elaborate infrastructural support in the environment to work. Simulation results show that the proposed trust agent can significantly outperform existing models against collusion.", "Medium access control (MAC) protocol plays a crucial role in energy-efficiency, latency reduction and throughput for sensor networks. However, it is nontrivial to achieve good performance in different facets of metrics at the same time. In this paper, we present the performance of an Adaptive Scheduling MAC (AS-MAC) protocol with different Adaptive Scheduling period (AS-period) in multi-hop networks. AS-MAC achieves very good performance in energy-efficiency, end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio (PDR) in different traffic loads, especially in the scenario of high traffic load. AS-MAC also exhibits adaptability to the different traffic loads with an adjustable AS-period.", "Combining mobile SNS concept and intelligent cloud technology, we propose a cloud and agent based architecture design, for a specific educational mobile SNS game.

Most popular, state-of-the-art approaches perform MRN sequentially. However, a sequential procedure may not optimally execute MRN in terms of maximizing the global outcome, and may even lead to unnecessary losses in some situations. The motivation of this research is to use a MNN to handle MRN concurrently so as to maximize the expected utility of MRN. Firstly, both the joint success rate and the joint utility by considering all related negotiations are dynamically calculated based on a MNN. Secondly, by employing a MNID, an agent\u2019s possible decision on each related negotiation is reflected by the value of expected utility.

However, the process of converting these theories into useful scaffoldings in such unique environments is highly challenging. In this paper, we explore the use of intelligent software agents to infuse advanced learning theories into the interactions among the learners as well as the learning environment. We propose a collaborative teachable agent which incorporates learning-by-teaching-others theory into a virtual learning environment (VLE) we have developed. We aim to set up conditions conducive for collaborative learning in VLEs using this agent. The effects of the proposed agent on the learning experience of the students have been verified in a field study in one of the high schools in Singapore.", "To generate believable virtual characters in real-time is a key issue to improve users\u2019 engaging experience in the interactive storytelling. In real life, the emotions and behaviors of characters evolve inductively according to the mutual causal relationships, with some stochastic variations. This is not addressed well in the virtual environment with conventional models, eg rule-based expert system, Fuzzy Cognitive Map and so on. In this paper, we use a computational model, namely Evolutionary Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM), to model the attributes of characters (such as emotions and behaviors) as concepts with the dynamic causal relationships among them. As an extension to FCM, E-FCM models not only the fuzzy causal relationships among the variables, but also the stochastic causal relationships, and asynchronous activity update of the concepts, so that the variables evolve in a dynamic manner with their respective evolving time schedules. As a result, the characters are presented with more realistic and dynamic emotions and behaviors, which enhances the user experience at last.", "In this paper, we introduce an novel emotional agent system in 3D virtual world based on OCC (Ortony, Clore and Collins) theory, FCM (Fuzzy Cognitive Map) and GoalNet. The agent system is designed based on Goal Net model. Emotional modeling and decision making are based on OCC and FCM inference. Emotions modeled by the OCC model are incorporated into FCM inference. It has been shown emotion has a great impact in decision making. The proposed agent system has been applied to design human-like dinosaur agents in the research project \u201cImmersion and Embodied Learning: Traces of Dinosaurs in Earth System Science\u201d supported by National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore.

It has been demonstrated that multi-agent systems can serve the needs of a real-time distributed manufacturing environment [6]. It would be most rewarding if an integrated manufacturing and service system (IMSS) could be easily and efficiently modeled by a multi-agent system. However, although there are well established methodologies to model agent mental states, there is an absence of effective tools to convert the design into implementation. This paper proposes a service based agent system modelling and design tool - the Goal Net Designer, to bridge the gap between modeling a multi-agent system and automatically implementing the design to serve the purpose of an IMSS.", "Interactive storytelling, emerging with virtual reality technology, has attracted a lot of research interests in recent years. In order to bridge the gap between story generation and story presentation, some hybrid narrative models are raised. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid interactive storytelling architecture S-MADE. It combines the story plot generation and character performance through goal execution and decomposition mechanism. Fuzzy Cognitive Goal Net (FCGN) is a goal modeling tool for modeling the story scenario and character behaviors. The goal decomposition algorithm enables for director agent to dispatch acts to characters easily. With this system, dynamic storylines as well as character behaviors are created in real time simultaneously, which is hard to be achieved in traditional approaches. Audiences are able to experience different perspectives through interactions with director and characters.", "Cognitive map (CM), fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) are two related tools for modeling human being's cognition and facilitating machine deduction over the cognitive model accordingly. FCM has extended CM by modeling the strength of the causal relationship. To acquire the ability of modeling the strength of cause and effect, multi-value FCM (MVFCM) is formally presented in this paper, which uses mutli-value concepts. Not surprisingly, FCM is more complex than CM and MVFCM is more complex than FCM. This paper proves that there exists a theoretical equivalence among MVFCM, FCM and CM. It shows that for every MVFCM, there exists a FCM, or a CM that represents the MVFCM. This result allows domain experts to model applications with more descriptive MVFCM form and perform theoretical analysis with the simpler CM form. The equivalence among the models also provides strong support to the theoretical\u00a0\u2026", "Recently there is a great demand for extending high throughput life science research to biomanufacturing. However, there is a gap from life science research to bio-manufacturing. Most of existing Bio-workflow tools/systems only provide an isolated solution to help bioscientist to orchestrate bio-R&D operations such as bio-database query, bio-computation and analysis etc for specific small bio-problems. They are static and lack of ability to adapt themselves in a dynamic changing environment. Bio-manufacturing involves many bioprocesses, each of which needs to choreographs a set of bio-workflows. Currently, none of the existing workflow systems support integrations of workflows from different workflow tools. Bio-scientists have to manually define and manage the workflows for bioprocesses through different workflow tools. This paper proposes a novel goal-oriented approach to modeling bioprocesses, to choreographing bio-workflows from different workflow tools, and to integrating agents, web services and workflows for automated execution. It also demonstrates how a multi-agent system can be further derived to adapt and automate complex bio-manufacturing workflow/processes in a dynamic changing environment.", "A market-oriented grid introduces an economic or market-oriented perspective to the grid. Negotiation is a vital component that facilitates the market-oriented grid. Negotiating agents play an indispensable role within the market-oriented grid.

Prevailing methods adopt off-the-shelf object detection networks to give object proposals and use the attention mechanism to model the relations between objects. They often miss some undefined semantic concepts of the pretrained model and fail to identify exact predicate relationships between objects. In this paper, we investigate an open research task of generating text descriptions for the given videos, and propose Cross-Modal Graph (CMG) with meta concepts for video captioning. Specifically, to cover the useful semantic concepts in video captions, we weakly learn the corresponding visual regions for text descriptions, where the associated visual regions and textual words are named cross-modal meta concepts.

Translating query execution plans into their vectorized representations is non-trivial. Recently, several query plan representation methods have been proposed. However, they have two limitations. First, they do not fully utilize readily available database statistics in the representation, which characterizes the data distribution. Second, they typically have difficulty in modeling long paths of information flow in a query plan, and capturing parent-children dependency between operators. To tackle these limitations, we propose QueryFormer, a learning-based query plan representation model with a tree-structured Transformer architecture. In particular, we propose a novel scheme to integrate histograms obtained from database systems into query plan encoding.

In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), one vertex is reachable by another if there exists a chain of directed edges connecting the two vertexes. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) reachability query methods mostly first index all the vertexes in the underlying DAG and assign them with different labels, and then use these indexes and/or labels to efficiently filter out as many unreachable queries as possible. Thus, because a large portion of unreachable queries can be identified without evoking any tedious path-finding process, the overall time taken by a huge number of queries is much shortened with a tolerable compensation on the additional index and/or label preprocessing time and space.

In the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, artificial curiosity provides a natural intrinsic motivation for efficient learning as inspired by human cognitive development; meanwhile, it can bridge the existing gap between AI research and practical application scenarios, such as overfitting, poor generalization, limited training samples, high computational cost, etc. As a result, curiosity-driven learning (CDL) has become increasingly popular, where agents are self-motivated to learn novel knowledge. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive review on the psychological study of curiosity and summarize a unified framework for quantifying curiosity as well as its arousal mechanism. Based on the psychological principle, we further survey the literature of existing CDL methods in the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Recommendation, and Classification, where both advantages and disadvantages as well as future work are discussed. As a result, this work provides fruitful insights for future CDL research and yield possible directions for further improvement.", "Clinical pathways are standardized, evidence-based multidisciplinary management plans. Many countries propose their national clinical pathways to improve the quality of care, reduce variation in clinical practice, and increase the efficient use of healthcare resources. Nevertheless, clinical pathways are typically not prescriptive, and the patient\u2019s care journey is an individual one, therefore how to handle the variances of clinical pathways is an important issue. Previous methods construct clinical pathway recommendation models either using national standard clinical pathways to obtain the guidance, or using real-world clinical datasets to obtain clinical experience. However, few research tries to use both of them. This will result in existing algorithms that cannot accurately recommend personalized clinical pathway.

Current works have mainly focused on supervised learning using data collected from various sensors to differentiate between PD and healthy subjects. However, such supervised methods are not ideal for prognosis where there are no labels (i.e., we do not know in advance which subjects will develop PD in the future). We propose to tackle the problem as a semi-supervised anomaly detection task, where we model the physiological patterns of healthy subjects instead. A self-supervised learning technique first learns a good representation of the sensor signals. The representations are then adapted to capture inter-class patterns for anomaly detection. Evaluation on a large-scale PD dataset shows that our approach can learn discriminative features.", "Familiarity design has been widely shown to be beneficial for improving players\u2019 perception and adoption of exergames, by reducing their perceived difficulty and complexity. However, players\u2019 perceived familiarity with exergames may differ according to their prior knowledge and experience. There still lacks a validated familiarity instrument for measuring players\u2019 perceived familiarity with a particular exergame. Such an instrument can inform exergame designers on how well familiarity design has been incorporated into the exergame. Moreover, it helps players to choose an exergame that could induce a higher level of familiarity. In this research, we propose a 10-item psychometric familiarity instrument to evaluate a player\u2019s perceived familiarity with exergames. The questions in the instrument are developed based on the sub-constructs of familiarity identified in prior research.

To reduce node failures and device dropouts, the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework has been proposed whereby cluster heads are designated to support the data owners through intermediate model aggregation. This decentralized learning approach reduces the reliance on a central controller, e.g., the model owner. However, the issues of resource allocation and incentive design are not well-studied in the HFL framework. In this paper, we consider a two-level resource allocation and incentive mechanism design problem.

To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management.

Based on improved short-term power consumption gap prediction, PIDS uses an optimal power adjustment plan which enables fine-grained Demand Response (DR) and Orderly Power Utilization (OPU) recommendations to ensure stable operation while minimizing power disruptions and improving fair treatment of participating companies. Deployed in August 2018, the platform is helping over 400 companies optimize their power consumption through DR while dynamically managing the OPU process for around 10,000 companies.

Given long hours watching TV in the elder population, most of the existing TV services are not geared for them. The elderly cannot tolerate complexity and negativity due to decline in cognitive abilities. In addition, the program is not adapted to the user\u2019s current emotional status. As a result, existing TV services can not achieve optimal performance across a broad set of user types and context. To provide content tailored to individual needs, and interests of the elderly, caregivers have to select an appropriate program manually.

However, building such a system is challenging on two fronts. First, the tradeoff between accuracy and monetary cost should be understood. Accuracy of each sensor can be empirically estimated from its sample rate. Typically, higher rate indicates higher accuracy. As a result, higher rate requires more computation resources to process the sampled data, incurring more monetary cost. Second, user needs change frequently. Thus, we need a resource allocation scheme that is (a) able to strike a good balance between accuracy and monetary cost and (b) adaptive enough to meet the frequently changing needs.

The app enables researchers to conduct largescale empirical studies designed to construct useful datasets reflecting the effectiveness of various persuasive techniques on people from different age groups in promoting intergenerational interactions.", "Reputation systems aggregate the ratings provided by buyers to gauge the reliability of sellers in e-marketplaces. The evaluation accuracy of seller reputation significantly impacts the sellers' future utility. The existence of unfair ratings is well-recognized to negatively affect the accuracy of reputation evaluation. Most of the existing approaches dealing with unfair ratings focus on filtering/discounting/aligning the possible unfair ratings caused by malicious attacks or subjective difference. However, these approaches are not effective against unfair ratings in the form of misreporting (e.g., a well-behaving buyer misjudged a seller and provided a negative rating to a transaction which deserves a positive one, and the buyer is willing to revert the misreported negative rating). In this case, how should the buyer undo the damage caused by such misreported ratings and help the seller recover utility loss?

A FCM for a dynamic system is a signed graph consisted of relevant concepts and causal relationships/weights between the concepts in the system.

Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system.

HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary.

Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.", "In this paper we present a novel multi-attribute face manipulation method based on textual descriptions. Previous text-based image editing methods either require test-time optimization for each individual image or are restricted to single attribute editing.

In order to address these challenges and achieve natural editing over multiple face attributes, we propose a new decoupling training scheme where we use group sampling to get text segments from same attribute categories, instead of whole complex sentences. Further, to preserve other existing face attributes, we encourage the model to edit the latent code of each attribute separately via a entropy constraint. During the inference phase, our model is able to edit new face images without any test-time optimization, even from complex textual prompts.

Meanwhile, the increase in factors demands more computation resources and increases system response latency. It has been observed that, under some certain context a search instance may require only a small set of useful factors instead of all factors in order to return high quality results. Therefore, removing ineffective factors accordingly can significantly improve system efficiency. In this paper, we report our experience incorporating our Contextual Factor Selection (CFS) approach into the Taobao e-commerce platform to optimize the selection of factors based on the context of each search query in order to simultaneously achieve high quality search results while significantly reducing latency time. This problem is treated as a combinatorial optimization problem which can be tackled through a sequential decision-making procedure. The problem can be efficiently solved by CFS through a deep reinforcement learning method with reward shaping to address the problems of reward signal scarcity and wide reward signal distribution in real-world search engines.

Although most NFISs primarily focus on accuracy, we have observed an ever increasing demand on improving the interpretability of NFISs and other types of machine learning systems. In this paper, we illustrate how we leverage the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in an NFIS called Genetic Algorithm and Rough Set Incorporated Neural Fuzzy Inference System (GARSINFIS). In a nutshell, GARSINFIS self-organizes its network structure with a small set of control parameters and constraints. Moreover, its autonomously generated inference rule base tries to achieve higher interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

With massive learners being offered MOOCs, there is a demand that the forum contents within MOOCs need to be classified in order to facilitate both learners and instructors. Therefore we investigate a significant application, which is to associate forum threads to subtitles of video clips. This task can be regarded as a document ranking problem, and the key is how to learn a distinguishable text representation from word sequences and learners\u2019 behavior sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel cascade model, which can capture both the latent semantics and latent similarity by modeling MOOC data.

To alleviate the problem of a shrinking workforce to deliver elderly care, using mobile intelligent assistants to lessen the caregivers' workload becomes a promising solution. However, the friendliness of such mobile assistants, which is seldom measured in a quantitative manner, may hinder their acceptance by the elderly users. In this paper, we propose a formalized systematic approach named Elderly Friendliness Evaluation Methodology (EFEM) to measure the elderly friendliness of any product, service or system. Furthermore, we apply EFEM to evaluate the elderly friendliness of five commercial mobile assistants and three prototypes. The comparison results show that the commercial assistants are less elderly-friendly than the prototypes.

A person normally performs activities of daily living (ADLs) on a regular basis. A person's ability to perform recurring ADLs indicates the person's wellness. Anomalies in activity patterns of a person might indicate changes in the person's wellness. A method is proposed in this paper for detecting anomalies in activity patterns of a lone occupant using his/her electricity consumption data. The proposed method infers anomalies in activity patterns of an occupant from electricity consumption patterns instead of explicitly monitoring the underlying individual activities. The proposed method provides a score which is a quantitative assessment of anomalies in electricity consumption pattern of an occupant for a given day. A survey was conducted to obtain the hourly activities of three lone occupants for a month.

A generic goal oriented software agent platform is proposed to automatically refine the animation, the NPC's personality and emotions, and the game story by learning from the player's realtime feedback from the emotion analyzing and gesture tracking modules.

Firstly, we build 3D caricature components eigenspaces by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Moreover, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to sample optimal projections in the eigenspaces for 3D real face components, and then we reconstruct 3D caricature components by the projections.

However, the present conventional approaches to engineering SOC systems are not able to address the complexities of open and dynamic environments, such as those in an extended virtual enterprise or in interorganisation workflows. This is the first survey paper for Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) to be applied to SOC.

Service trading, in which service provider and service consumer negotiate for a mutually acceptable agreement on multi-issues such as service performance, access cost etc., is one of the most important components in building the Economic Grid. In view of Pervasive Grid, a new challenging issue is that participants on pervasive devices usually have limited computational capacity. And it is also desirable that a multi-issue negotiation agreement can be reached as quickly as possible since the wireless communication to exchange the offers is generally unreliable and power-consuming. Hence, an agile, automated, but lightweight multi-issue decision-making model is needed to facilitate service negotiation in Pervasive Grid.

A prototype system was developed based on the architecture. It has shown that our method is not only promising but also practical.", "Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is an emerging topic with prominent advantages. Existing methods usually design skeleton descriptors with raw body joints or perform skeleton sequence representation learning. However, they typically cannot concurrently model different body-component relations, and rarely explore useful semantics from fine-grained representations of body joints. In this paper, we propose a generic Transformer-based Skeleton Graph prototype contrastive learning (TranSG) approach with structure-trajectory prompted reconstruction to fully capture skeletal relations and valuable spatial-temporal semantics from skeleton graphs for person re-ID. Specifically, we first devise the Skeleton Graph Transformer (SGT) to simultaneously learn body and motion relations within skeleton graphs, so as to aggregate key correlative node features into graph representations. Then, we propose the Graph Prototype Contrastive learning (GPC) to mine the most typical graph features (graph prototypes) of each identity, and contrast the inherent similarity between graph representations and different prototypes from both skeleton and sequence levels to learn discriminative graph representations. Last, a graph Structure-Trajectory Prompted Reconstruction (STPR) mechanism is proposed to exploit the spatial and temporal contexts of graph nodes to prompt skeleton graph reconstruction, which facilitates capturing more valuable patterns and graph semantics for person re-ID. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TranSG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, we introduce a stochastic resource allocation scheme for QKD to support FL networks. In the network, remote FL workers are connected to the server to train an aggregated global model in a distributed manner. However, due to the unpredictable number of workers at each location, the demand for secret-key rates to support secure model transmission to the server is not uniform.

This is done via a therapist-facilitated smartphone app that focuses on strengths and meaning derived from parents\u2019 caregiving journey. NeW-I is empirically informed by an international systematic review and a Singapore-based qualitative inquiry on the lived experience of parental bereavement and supported by anticipatory grief interventions literature for improving the holistic well-being for parent-caregivers of seriously ill children. NeW-I is implemented in Singapore as an open-label two-armed randomized controlled trial comprising an intervention and control group.

Because a PHR contains lots of sensitive information, the patients are only willing to share their records with authorized doctors with their permission. There are three main challenging issues: (1) it is costly to store and maintain the growing PHRs data; (2) the existing PHR systems still face the privacy leakage risk during data transmission and access control processes; and (3) the response speed cannot meet the need in an emergency situation, especially when the patients are unconscious. In this paper, based on the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric, we propose a PHR management system preserving patients\u2019 privacy and also supporting emergency access. In the system, we use reencryption technology and the anonymous identity mapping mechanism to protect patient privacy and use smart contracts to define access control strategies in an emergency situation. Furthermore, we use a quick response code and bloom filter to optimize system performance. The security analysis and experimental results show that our proposed framework guarantees the privacy of patient data from multiple aspects while improving the efficiency with which doctors can obtain PHR information.", "Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeletons is an important emerging topic with many merits. Existing solutions rarely explore valuable body-component relations in skeletal structure or motion, and they typically lack the ability to learn general representations with unlabeled skeleton data for person re-ID. This paper proposes a generic unsupervised Skeleton Prototype Contrastive learning paradigm with Multi-level Graph Relation learning (SPC-MGR) to learn effective representations from unlabeled skeletons to perform person re-ID. Specifically, we first construct unified multi-level skeleton graphs to fully model body structure within skeletons. Then we propose a multi-head structural relation layer to comprehensively capture relations of physically-connected body-component nodes in graphs. A full-level collaborative relation layer is exploited to infer collaboration between motion-related body parts at various levels, so as to capture rich body features and recognizable walking patterns. Lastly, we propose a skeleton prototype contrastive learning scheme that clusters feature-correlative instances of unlabeled graph representations and contrasts their inherent similarity with representative skeleton features (\"skeleton prototypes\") to learn discriminative skeleton representations for person re-ID. Empirical evaluations show that SPC-MGR significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods, and it also achieves highly competitive person re-ID performance for more general scenarios.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegen-erative disease that causes cognitive deficits, which severely interfere with daily life.

We compare the different pre-training methods in a standardized setting. Our experiments find that supervised pre-training and joint training outperform unsupervised pre-training when data is extremely limited. With more data, unsupervised pre-training closes the performance gap and, in some cases, outperforms supervised pre-training and joint training. In addition, we propose a simple hybrid approach of unsupervised pre-training followed by joint\u00a0\u2026", "Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of various types of disease diagnostic tasks. However, it is still challenging to apply ML models to perform diabetes-related prediction tasks mainly because patients' health records are sparse and have a vast amount of missing values. Missing values often break the diabetes prediction pipelines, posing challenges to existing approaches. Such problem deteriorates significantly when critical attribute values (e.g., blood test results on HbAlc, FPG and OGTT2hr) are missing. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale diabetes-related dataset named Chronic Disease Management System (CDMS) dataset, which collects the clinical records of more than 700,000 visits of over 65,000 patients across eight years.

However, in recent years, the use of blockchain has expanded to a wide range of networks and application domains. This includes time-sensitive applications which need transactions to be processed fast enough to meet delay requirements.

In this paper, we propose a mining strategy that is aimed at minimizing the average waiting time per transaction by ensuring a certain minimum required block size, based on the average transaction arrival rate, mining service rate, and maximum block size. We derive an expression for the average transaction waiting time of the proposed mining strategy and determine the optimal mining rule. Numerical results show that the average waiting time per transaction can be reduced by up to  using the proposed mining strategy compared to the traditional strategy in which miners immediately start the next mining round using the transactions already waiting in the pool.", "With the current raging spread of the COVID19, early forecasting of the future epidemic trend is of great significance to public health security. The COVID-19 is virulent and spreads widely. An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions.

A large scale MAS may have billions of possible ways of organization, depending on the number of agents, the roles, and the relationships among these agents. These characteristics make it impractical to find an optimal choice of organization using exhaustive search methods. In this report, we propose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing hierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm, called the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with a repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic hierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array representation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operatorliterate. A case study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is provided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which lead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search.

The previous investigation has shown that the goal net model can support well multiple action and goal selection. In this paper, we will further show that the goal net model can simulate motivated learning of goal selections. More specifically, a reorganization algorithm is proposed to convert an original goal net to its counterpart that our learning algorithm can operate on. Our experiments show that in dynamic environments, agents with learning algorithms outperform agents with the recursive searching algorithm. In addition, the reorganization algorithm is not limited to the goal net model. It is applicable to other agent models.", "A performance mark of a BDI agent is how fast it can react to and process incoming event sequences. To the best of our knowledge, few papers have been published about predicting an agent's average response time for an event sequence before the agent is applied in a real project. In this paper, we first introduce a simulation method. In simulation, a sequence of events with attributes, such as priorities and amounts of time needed to process the events, is input to the agent at designed insertion time. The events are processed by the agent according to the attributes. The statistics of processing time can be recorded. Then we make some theoretical analysis to estimate the average response time when an agent processes a sequence of events based on probability and queueing theory. Comparison experiments show that the results from analysis are quite matching with the results from simulation experiments.

However, as e-market environments become open and dynamic, existing agent negotiation approaches expose some limitations. Static negotiation strategies and offer evaluation approaches might fail to capture dynamic changes of market situations, as well as changes of negotiators\u2019 expectations on negotiation outcomes. When market situations change, agents may need modify their negotiation strategies, expectations and criteria on offer evaluations as well as counter-offer generations in order to maximize their profits. Furthermore, in multi-issue negotiations, agents may have multiple preferences, which might not be delivered by most of existing negotiation approaches. In this paper, we propose a market-based multi-issue negotiation\u00a0\u2026", "\u201c...

AIM has the ability of representing various types of fuzzy concepts, temporal concepts, and dynamic causal relationships between concepts. It also has the ability of handling feedback and analyzing inference patterns over different causal impact models. Based on AIM, a new type of intelligent agent, Dynamic Inference Agent (DIA) is presented. A dynamic inference agent has the ability to model, infer and make decisions on behalf of human beings. It uses numeric representations and computation instead of symbolic representation and logic deduction to represent knowledge and to carry out the inferences respectively. Thus the construction of DIA is simplified and the implementation code is compact. The application of DIA to various areas, especially for electronic commerce over the Internet is exemplified.", "Automatic diagnosis for medical images is a significant research problem of computer-aided diagnosis to reduce the workload of doctors in recent years. However, existing deep learning approaches for diagnoses are usually black-box models with implicit decision-making processes that make them inexplainable. To alleviate the issue, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-driven Interpretable Network (KdINet) for interpretable disease classification of medical images. KdINet first exploits the pretrained CNN module and the hierarchical representation module to learn two different disease feature representations (i.e., visual disease features and hierarchical disease features). Subsequently, the joint training of two disease features by KdINet\u2019s disease classifier learns a hierarchical classification criterion to infer the diagnosis and generate corresponding interpretable justifications (i.e., ancestral disease paths of the\u00a0\u2026", "Explainable recommendation systems provide explanations for recommendation results to improve their transparency and persuasiveness. The existing explainable recommendation methods generate textual explanations without explicitly considering the user's preferences on different aspects of the item. In this paper, we propose a novel explanation generation framework, namely  A spect-guided  E xplanation generation with  S yntax  G raph ( AESG ), for explainable recommendation. Specifically, AESG employs a review-based syntax graph to provide a unified view of the user/item details. An aspect-guided graph pooling operator is proposed to extract the aspect-relevant information from the review-based syntax graphs to model the user's preferences on an item at the aspect level. Then, an aspect-guided explanation decoder is developed to generate aspects and aspect-relevant explanations based on the\u00a0\u2026", "The goal of sequential recommendation is to predict the next item that a user would like to interact with, by capturing her dynamic historical behaviors. However, most existing sequential recommendation methods do not focus on solving the long-tail item recommendation problem that is caused by the imbalanced distribution of item data. To solve this problem, we propose a novel sequential recommendation framework, named MASR (ie Memory Bank Augmented Long-tail Sequential Recommendation). MASR is an \"Open-book'' model that combines novel types of memory banks and a retriever-copy network to alleviate the long-tail problem. During inference, the designed retriever-copy network retrieves related sequences from the training samples and copies the useful information as a cue to improve the recommendation performance on tail items.

This paper explores the discovery of new COVID-19 research approaches based on dynamic link prediction, which analyze the dynamic topological network of keywords to predict possible connections of research concepts.

Existing re-ranking methods are typically designed for conventional person re-ID with RGB images, while skeleton representation re-ranking for skeleton-based person re-ID still remains to be explored. To fill this gap, we revisit the   -reciprocal distance re-ranking model in this letter, and propose a generic re-ranking method that exploits the salient skeleton features to perform   -reciprocal distance encoding for skeleton-based person re-ID re-ranking. In particular, we devise the skeleton sequence pooling to aggregate the most salient features of skeletons within a sequence, and combine both original Euclidean distance and   -reciprocal distance to re-rank the skeleton sequence representations for person re-ID. Furthermore, we propose the context-based Rank-1 voting that jointly exploits the initial ranking\u00a0\u2026", "This paper investigates an open research problem of generating text-image pairs to improve the training of fine-grained image-to-text cross-modal retrieval task, and proposes a novel framework for paired data augmentation by uncovering the hidden semantic information of StyleGAN2 model. Specifically, we first train a StyleGAN2 model on the given dataset. We then project the real images back to the latent space of StyleGAN2 to obtain the latent codes. To make the generated images manipulatable, we further introduce a latent space alignment module to learn the alignment between StyleGAN2 latent codes and the corresponding textual caption features. When we do online paired data augmentation, we first generate augmented text through random token replacement, then pass the augmented text into the latent space alignment module to output the latent codes, which are finally fed to StyleGAN2 to generate\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we investigate an open research task of generating 3D cartoon face shapes from single 2D GAN generated human faces and without 3D supervision, where we can also manipulate the facial expressions of the 3D shapes. To this end, we discover the semantic meanings of StyleGAN latent space, such that we are able to produce face images of various expressions, poses, and lighting by controlling the latent codes. Specifically, we first finetune the pretrained StyleGAN face model on the cartoon datasets. By feeding the same latent codes to face and cartoon generation models, we aim to realize the translation from 2D human face images to cartoon styled avatars. We then discover semantic directions of the GAN latent space, in an attempt to change the facial expressions while preserving the original identity. As we do not have any 3D annotations for cartoon faces, we manipulate the latent codes to generate images with different poses and lighting, such that we can reconstruct the 3D cartoon face shapes. We validate the efficacy of our method on three cartoon datasets qualitatively and quantitatively.", "To reduce node failures and device dropouts, the Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework has been proposed whereby cluster heads are designated to support the data owners through intermediate model aggregation. This decentralized learning approach reduces the reliance on a central controller, e.g., the model owner. However, the issues of resource allocation and incentive design are not well-studied in the HFL framework. In this chapter, we consider a two-level resource allocation and incentive mechanism design problem. In the lower level, the cluster heads offer rewards in exchange for the data owners\u2019 participation, and the data owners are free to choose which cluster to join. Specifically, we apply the evolutionary game theory to model the dynamics of the cluster selection process.

To manage big data and enable analytics at the edge of the network, large amount of computation power is required to perform the computation intensive tasks. However, the energy-constrained IoT devices are not able to perform the computation tasks without compromising the quality-of-service of the applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network in which users can offload their computation tasks to edge servers through coded edge offloading or perform local computation with the wireless power transfer derived from coalitions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as mobile charging stations.

However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process.

The key components of a general decision framework [4], which is used to model agents\u2019 knowledge base, include decisions, goals, and attributes. Preferences can be specified for decision information, such as attributes or goals, to prioritize and order them. In real-life applications, preferences do not always remain the same but may vary in different contexts. For example, in the problem of determining whether a patient is at high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), although the APOE4 allele is a genetic risk factor for both men and women, its magnitude and effect appear to differ between genders. Medical research suggests that the effect of APOE4 is far more pronounced in women than in men [1, 5]. Considering the patient being a man or a woman as the context for this decision problem, we may arrive at the following two different preferences:\u2022 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc384\u227b \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc444 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 1 (patient is a female)", "The user review data have been demonstrated to be effective in solving different recommendation problems. Previous review-based recommendation methods usually employ sophisticated compositional models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn semantic representations from the review data for recommendation. However, these methods mainly capture the local and consecutive dependency between neighbouring words in a word window. Therefore, they may not be effective in capturing the long-term, non-consecutive, and global dependency between words coherently.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to meet these requirements while minimizing the clients work and communication cost. First, a relaxed notion of ciphertext indistinguishability on partitioned data is formalized, called class indistinguishability, which provides a level of ciphertext indistinguishability similar to that of bucketization but allows the server to perform search of relevant data and filter false positives.

In this paper, we propose the FedHumor approach to recognize humorous text contents in a personalized manner through federated learning (FL). It is a federated BERT model capable of jointly considering the overall distribution of humor scores with humor labels by individuals for given texts. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant advantages of FedHumor in recognizing humor contents accurately for people with diverse humor preferences compared to 9 state-of-the-art humor recognition approaches.", "The invention proposes that a software agent for assisting a user in a virtual environment defined by a first concept map, maintains a record of its experiences in the form of a second concept map.

With the emerging artificial intelligence, computers start to be able to read and understand like people in some context. They can even read better than human beings for some tasks, but have little clue in other tasks. It will be very beneficial if we can identify the levels of machine comprehension ability, which will direct us on the further improvement. Turing test is a well-known test of the difference between computer intelligence and human intelligence. In order to be able to compare the difference between people reading and machines reading, we proposed a test called (reading) Comprehension Ability Test (CAT).CAT is similar to Turing test, passing of which means we cannot differentiate people from algorithms in term of their comprehension ability. CAT has multiple levels showing the different abilities in reading comprehension, from identifying basic facts, performing inference, to understanding the intent and sentiment.", "A computerized reward mechanism system is proposed which makes use both of presently collected data relating to the customer, and a database of historical data relating to the customer.

This may be done without requiring customers to participate in a process of signing up to use the system. The presently collected data include responses to questions put to the customer relating to his present shopping experience. Customer honesty is considered in the step of determining which rewards to offer the consumer, to encourage the consumers to express their feelings more clearly.", "How to better utilize sequential information has been extensively studied in the setting of recommender systems. To this end, architectural inductive biases such as Markov-Chains, Recurrent models, Convolutional networks and many others have demonstrated reasonable success on this task. This paper proposes a new neural architecture, multi-scale Quasi-RNN for next item Recommendation (QR-Rec) task. Our model provides the best of both worlds by exploiting multi-scale convolutional features as the compositional gating functions of a recurrent cell. The model is implemented in a multi-scale fashion, i.e., convolutional filters of various widths are implemented to capture different union-level features of input sequences which influence the compositional encoder. The key idea aims to capture the recurrent relations between different kinds of local features, which has never been studied previously in the context of recommendation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 well-established datasets, outperforming strong competitors such as FPMC, Fossil and Caser absolutely by 0.57%-7.16% and relatively by 1.44%-17.65% in terms of MAP, Recall@10 and NDCG@10.", "The lack of systematic pain management training and support among primary care physicians (PCPs) limits their ability to provide quality care for patients with pain.

However, most of the existing solutions to worker response evaluation meet with significant challenges. Part of them are only able to obtain locally optimal results with low accuracy, while the others have to pay a high price to achieve global optimality. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a solution to worker quality management which is able to obtain optimal evaluation results close to the globally one with acceptable computational overhead. It is proved to be globally optimal results under certain conditions.

This article surveys the field of HCSs from the perspective of incentives and mechanism design. We first review state-of-the-art HCSs, focusing on how incentives are provided to users. We then use mechanism design to theoretically analyze different incentives. We survey the mechanisms derived from state-of-the-art HCSs as well as classic mechanisms that have been used in HCSs. Finally, we discuss eight promising research directions for designing incentives in HCSs.", "Query-URL relevance, measuring the relevance of each retrieved URL with respect to a given query, is one of the fundamental criteria to evaluate the performance of commercial search engines.

In this case, the annotators\u2019 subjectivity reflected in each annotator individual judgment (AIJ) inevitably affects the quality of the ground truth relevance (GTR). But to the best of our knowledge, the potential impact of AIJs on estimating GTRs has not been studied and exploited quantitatively by existing work.

However, the majority of time spent online by e-commerce users is used for searching for information and making decisions with regard to the products of interest. Precommerce services help a customer from the very beginning of his interaction with an e-commerce system with the objective of eventually leading to a transaction.

In such a precommerce platform, customers can participate in various facets of a transaction in more meaningful and empowering ways.", "An intelligent agent situated in some environment needs to know the preferred states it is expected to achieve so that it can work towards achieving them. The preferred states the agent has selected to achieve at a given time are its \"goals\". One popular approach for deciding which preferred state to adopt as goal at a given time is to assign utility values to these states and then choose the one with the highest utility at a given time. However a preferred state can be useful to a varying degree depending upon the situation the agent is in and hence such static utility cannot represent its usefulness indifferent situations. In this paper we propose an approach of representing utility of preferred states based on the concept of motivations which adjusts their utility according to the situation the agent is in.", "Interactive virtual storytelling attracts a lot of research interests to create engaging, interactive and dynamic storytelling.

The case study demonstrates that the fuzzy cognitive agent is both flexible\u00a0\u2026", "E-commerce live streaming as an increasingly popular sales model has generated a significant amount of gross merchandise value (GMV) for e-commerce platforms. Live streaming recommendation systems (LSRS) of e-commerce aim to recommend the most appropriate live channels for users to motivate them to buy products. Existing LSRS methods focus only on the user\u2019s interaction behaviors on the live channel (live domain) while ignoring the user\u2019s behaviors and intentions on the e-commerce product (product domain). As a result, the user\u2019s consistent purchase intentions in the cross-domain are not being fully captured, especially when user present differentiated purchase intentions in the cross-domain. How to disentangle user\u2019s consistent intentions and domain-specific intentions in the cross-domain poses a challenge to the LSRS of e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we present a live channel\u00a0\u2026", "The use of web services allows for an easy and cost-effective way to implementation natural language processing capabilities such as sentiment analysis in digital interventions such as those used in mental healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, the majority of studies to date focus on the use of sentiment analysis for the analysis of user reviews and social platforms. This study thus aims to explore the use of 18 currently available web services in the analysis of user submitted content from a digital mental health intervention. The web services are compared on the basis of their accuracy, precision, recall, f-measures and mean square error. Given the sensitive nature of user content from digital mental health interventions, we also explored how the various web services handled the data submitted to them for analysis.

In this paper, we present the Attributed Bipartite Co-clustering (ABC) problem which unifies two main concepts: (i) bipartite modularity optimization, and (ii) attribute cohesiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to find co-clusters while considering the attribute cohesiveness. We prove that ABC is NP-hard and is not in APX, unless P=NP. We propose three algorithms: (1) a top-down algorithm; (2) a bottom-up algorithm; (3) a group matching algorithm. Extensive experimental results on real-world attributed bipartite networks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.", "The performance of the Federated Learning suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. In this chapter, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. Therefore, we present a joint auction\u2013coalition formation framework to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the UAVs. The joint auction\u2013coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions. Thereafter, we design an auction\u00a0\u2026", "Recently, coded distributed computing (CDC), with advantages in intensive computation and reduced latency, has attracted a lot of research interest for edge computing, in particular, IoT applications, including IoT data preprocessing and data analytics. Nevertheless, it can be challenging for edge infrastructure providers (EIPs) with limited edge resources to support IoT applications performed in a CDC approach in edge networks, given the additional computational resources required by CDC. In this article, we propose \u201ccoded edge federation\u201d (CEF), in which different EIPs collaboratively provide edge resources for CDC tasks. To study the Nash equilibrium, when no EIP has an incentive to unilaterally alter its decision on edge resource allocation, we model the CEF based on the evolutionary game theory. Since the replicator dynamics of the classical evolutionary game are unable to model economic-aware EIPs\u00a0\u2026", "Explainable recommendation systems provide explanations for recommendation results to improve their transparency and persuasiveness. The existing explainable recommendation methods generate textual explanations without explicitly considering the user's preferences on different aspects of the item. In this paper, we propose a novel explanation generation framework, named Hierarchical Aspect-guided explanation Generation (HAG), for explainable recommendation. Specifically, HAG employs a review-based syntax graph to provide a unified view of the user/item details. An aspect-guided graph pooling operator is proposed to extract the aspect-relevant information from the review-based syntax graphs to model the user's preferences on an item at the aspect level. Then, a hierarchical explanation decoder is developed to generate aspects and aspect-relevant explanations based on the attention mechanism. The experimental results on three real datasets indicate that HAG outperforms state-of-the-art explanation generation methods in both single-aspect and multi-aspect explanation generation tasks, and also achieves comparable or even better preference prediction accuracy than strong baseline methods.", "Power iteration has been applied to compute the eigenvectors of the similarity matrix in spectral clustering tasks. However, these power iteration based clustering methods usually suffer from the following two problems:(1) the power iteration usually converges very slowly;(2) the singular value decomposition method adopted to obtain the eigenvectors of the similarity matrix is time-consuming. To solve these problems, we propose a novel clustering method named Adaptive Power Iteration Clustering (AdaPIC). Specifically, AdaPIC employs a sequence of rank-one matrices to approximate the normalized similarity matrix. Then, the first K+ 1 eigenvectors can be computed in parallel, and the stopping condition of power iteration can be automatically yielded based on the target clustering error. We performed extensive experiments on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdaPIC method\u00a0\u2026", "Visual storyline generation is the problem of selecting and sequencing a set of visual materials (i.e. images and video clips) to produce a video to elicit certain cognitive or emotional responses from viewers. In this paper, we enhance the viewing experience of generated visual storylines with the Shot Composition, Selection and Plotting (ShotCSP) approach. Designed for generating promotional videos in ecommerce settings, ShotCSP considers three key film-making principles into the visual storyline generation pipeline: a) proximity-aware scene transition, b) sound logic flow, and c) graphic discontinuity. We propose two novel metrics to enhance viewing experience: 1) Semantic Distance, which measures how related a shot is to the product being promoted; and 2) Salient Region Ratio, which estimates attention to product details in a shot.

In GSM, coaching is presented as an approach that helps older adults with low prior experience with digital technology to nevertheless enjoy digital health games and the benefits they provide. Propp\u2019s theory in storytelling is used to structure while persuasion, goal setting and familiarity augments the set of available coaching strategies. With GSM, a coached gameplay session is crafted on top of the Pumpkin Garden health game. This form of health game coaching is then evaluated through a small-scale phenomenological study. Effects of GSM-driven coaching were positively exhibited by our older players, proving that GSM is a viable way to coach older adults to enjoy health games.", "In the past decade, recommender systems for e-commerce have witnessed significant advancement. Recommendation scenarios can be divided into different type (eg, pre-, during-, post-purchase, campaign, promotion, bundle) for different user groups or different businesses. For different scenarios, the goals of recommendation are different. This is reflected by the different performance metrics employed. In addition, online promotional campaigns, which attract high traffic volumes, are also a critical factor affecting e-commerce recommender systems. Typically, prior to a promotional campaign, the Add-to-Cart Rate (ACR) is the target of optimization. During the campaign, this changes to Gross Merchandise Volumes (GMV). Immediately after the campaign, it becomes Click Through Rates CTR. Dynamically adapting among these potentially conflicting optimization objectives is an important capability for recommender systems deployed in real-world e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we report our experience designing and deploying the Deep Controllable Learning-To-Rank (DC-LTR) recommender system to address this challenge. It enhances the feedback controller in LTR with multi-objective optimization so as to maximize different objectives under constraints. Its ability to dynamically adapt to changing business objectives has resulted in significant business advantages. Since September 2019, DC-LTR has become a core service enabling adaptive online training and real-time deployment ranking models based on changing business objectives in AliExpress and Lazada.

An effort designed to overcome a cluster of bottlenecks inherent in existing centralized financial systems, Bitcoin has always been championed by the crypto community as an example of the spirit of decentralization. While the decentralized nature of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm has often been discussed in great detail, no systematic study has so far been conducted to quantitatively measure the degree of decentralization of Bitcoin from an asset perspective -- How decentralized is Bitcoin as a financial asset? We present in this paper the first systematic investigation of the degree of decentralization for Bitcoin based on its entire transaction history. We proposed both static and dynamic analysis of Bitcoin transaction network with quantifiable decentralization measures developed based on network analysis and market efficiency study. Case studies are also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics.", "Population aging is becoming an increasingly important issue around the world. As people live longer, they also tend to suffer from more challenging medical conditions. Currently, there is a lack of a holistic technology-powered solution for providing quality care at an affordable cost to patients suffering from co-morbidity.

We investigate useful in-game behaviour markers which can support machine learning-based predictive analytics on patients\u2019 risk of developing DPD co-morbidity.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of millions across the globe. In Singapore, promoting safe distancing by managing crowds in public areas have been the cornerstone of containing the community spread of the virus. One of the most important solutions to maintain social distancing is to monitor the crowdedness of indoor and outdoor points of interest. Using Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as a testbed, we develop and deploy a platform that provides live and predicted crowd counts for key locations on campus to help users plan their trips in an informed manner, so as to mitigate the risk of community transmission.", "Goals provide a high-level abstraction of an agent\u2019s objectives and guide its behavior in complex environments. As agents become more intelligent, it is necessary to ensure that the agent\u2019s goals are aligned with the goals of the agent designers to avoid unexpected or unwanted agent behavior. In this work, we propose using Goal Net, a goal-oriented agent modelling methodology, as a way for agent designers to incorporate their prior knowledge regarding the subgoals an agent needs to achieve in order to accomplish an overall goal. This knowledge is used to guide the agent\u2019s learning process to train it to achieve goals in dynamic environments where its goal may change between episodes.

The episodes are used to produce a second database (episodic memory, EM), and the classification is also used to update a third database (semantic memory, SM) organized using the concepts. The semantic memory thus summarizes the user's interaction with the concepts during the episodes.

The study of AI has gradually shifted from task-oriented tool-like objects which can execute computational and analytical works, to humanoid characters which are characterized by cognitive and social intelligence. As the next generation of technology that will be seamlessly woven into everyday lives, in addition to accuracy and efficiency, AIs need to be more human-like in order to interact, facilitate and collaborate with humans on various tasks. However, within the AI research community, this topic remains less familiar to many researchers.

This prevailing notion has resulted in many existing AM approaches failing to incorporate rest-breaks into the crowdsourcing process to help workers maintain productivity and wellbeing in the long run. To address this problem, we extend the Affective Crowdsourcing (AC) framework to propose the Opportunistic Work-Rest Scheduling (OWRS) approach. It takes into account information on a worker\u2019s mood, current workload and desire to rest to produce dynamic work-rest schedules which jointly minimize collective worker effort output while maximizing\u00a0\u2026", "Prospective memory is a form of memory involving remembering to perform delayed intentions or planned actions.

Based on the theoretical background of PM, this paper thoroughly analyzes the factors that will affect the PM task performance and proposes a computational approach for determining the appropriate number of reminders and reminding method.

As the current generation of seniors demonstrate relative good health and willingness to contribute to productive aging activities after retirement, the prevailing perception which used to regard seniors as being similar to the handicapped has changed.

A lot of attention has been paid to emotion modeling which is at the core of believability. However, most of the existing emotion models neglect the epistemology-based emotions, which are knowledge-related emotions that affect the human learning process. Studies have shown that curiosity is an important epistemology-based emotion that positively influences social learning. Hence, modeling curiosity in learning companions may improve human learners' learning experience in a virtual environment. However, existing curiosity models assume simplified cognitive processes and fail to capture multiple sources of curiosity stimuli. In this paper, we propose a novel model of curiosity for learning companions to capture salient curiosity stimuli through a psychologically inspired approach.

Methods In rats with chronic SAD or sham operation, the aortic structure was measured by computer-assisted image analysis, the aortic function by isolated artery preparation, and angiotensin \u2161 concentration by radioimmunoassay. Results and Conclusion The aortic structural remodeling developed progressively at 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks after SAD. Aortic structural remodeling after SAD expressed mainly as aortic hypertrophy due to SMC growth and collagen accumulation. The aortic contraction elicited by norepinephrine (NE) was progressively increased 8, 16 and 32 weeks after SAD. The aortic relaxation elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) was depressed 8, 16 and 32 weeks after SAD. In addition, in 32-week SAD rats the NE-induced contraction was not increased by endothelial denudation. These indicated that the increased contraction and depressed relaxation after SAD were related to the change of endothelium and/or the change of interaction between endothelium and SMC. In 10-week SAD rats, plasma angiotensin \u2161 concentration remained unchanged, whereas aortic angiotensin \u2161 concentration was significantly increased, suggesting that activation of tissue renin-angiotensin system may be involved in SAD-induced aortic remodeling.", "The rapidly growing interest in building up multimedia applications has created a need for applying database technology to multimedia systems, to support the efficient access, query, and retrieval of complex multimedia information.

As a classic ETA method, Origin-Destination-based (OD-based) ETA predicts the delivery time only based on the attributes (ie, sender address, receiver address, seller, and payment time) of packages under the condition that the delivery route is unavailable. However, existing OD-based methods only exploit attributes associated with an individual order, which fail to model the higher-order interactions within orders and attributes, and fail to sufficiently exploit the graph-structure knowledge (ie, relation of orders and attributes) and feature-based knowledge (ie, statistical properties) of orders simultaneously, resulting in inaccurate predictions.

CFEs can enhance informational fairness and trustworthiness, and provide suggestions for users who receive adverse predictions. However, recent research has shown that multiple CFEs can be offered for the same instance or instances with slight differences. Multiple CFEs provide flexible choices and cover diverse desiderata for user selection. However, individual fairness and model reliability will be damaged if unstable CFEs with different costs are returned. Existing methods fail to exploit flexibility and address the concerns of non-robustness simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective solution named Counterfactual Explanations with Minimal Satisfiable Perturbations (CEMSP). Specifically, CEMSP constrains changing values of abnormal features with the help of their semantically meaningful normal ranges. For efficiency, we model the problem as a Boolean satisfiability problem to modify as few features as possible. Additionally, CEMSP is a general framework and can easily accommodate more practical requirements, e.g., casualty and actionability. Compared to existing methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our method provides more robust explanations while preserving flexibility.", "Recently, contrastive learning has become a key component in fine-tuning code search models for software development efficiency and effectiveness. It pulls together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications. 2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less ``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE. Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the distribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise mutual information estimation. We furthermore discuss the superiority of proposed loss functions with other design alternatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-InfoNCE and weights estimation methods under state-of-the-art code search models on a large-scale public dataset consisting of six programming languages.

However, the development of supervised learning methods based on EEG signals has been hindered by the high cost and significant label discrepancies to manually label large-scale EEG datasets. Self-supervised frameworks are adopted in vision and language fields to solve this issue, but the lack of EEG-specific theoretical foundations hampers their applicability across various tasks. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven cross-view contrastive learning framework (KDC2), which integrates neurological theory to extract effective representations from EEG with limited labels. The KDC2 method creates scalp and neural views of EEG signals, simulating the internal and external representation of brain activity. Sequentially, inter-view and cross-view contrastive learning pipelines in combination with various augmentation methods are applied to capture neural features from different views. By modeling prior neural knowledge based on homologous neural information consistency theory, the proposed method extracts invariant and complementary neural knowledge to generate combined representations. Experimental results on different downstream tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the superior generalization of neural knowledge-supported EEG representations across various brain tasks.", "On behalf of the organizing committee, we are delighted to deliver this conference report for the 2022 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI 2022), which was held in Singapore from 4th to 7th December 2022.

The mainstream approaches adopt the Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder architecture to align the visual and linguistic features. However, they rarely consider the importance of cross-modal interaction (e.g., the interaction between images and reports) and do not adequately explore the relations between multi-modal medical data, leading to inaccurate and incoherent reports. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Memory Transformer model (CMT) to process multi-modal medical data (i.e., medical images, medical terminology knowledge, and medical report text), and leverage the relations between multi-modal medical data to generate accurate medical reports.

Most existing works of 3D generative models directly take the Gaussian prior as input for the decoder to generate 3D point clouds, which fail to learn disentangled latent codes, leading noisy interpolated results. Most of the GAN-based models fail to discriminate the local geometries, resulting in the point clouds generated not evenly distributed at the object surface, hence degrading the point cloud generation quality. Moreover, prevailing methods adopt computation-intensive frameworks, such as flow-based models and Markov chains, which take plenty of time and resources in the training phase. To resolve these limitations, this paper proposes a unified style-aware network architecture combining both point-wise distance loss and adversarial loss, StarNet which is able to reconstruct and generate high-fidelity and even 3D point clouds using a mapping network that can effectively disentangle the Gaussian prior from input's high-level attributes in the mapped latent space to generate realistic interpolated objects. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the point cloud reconstruction and generation tasks, but is more lightweight in model size, requires much fewer parameters and less time for model training.", "A user-item utility matrix represents the utility (or preference) associated with each (user, item) pair, such as citation counts, rating/vote on items or locations, and clicks on items. A high utility value indicates a strong association of the pair. In this work, we consider the problem of summarizing strong association for a large user-item matrix using a small summary size. Traditional techniques fail to distinguish user groups associated with different items (such as top-l item selection) or fail to focus on high utility (such as similarity- based subspace clustering and biclustering). We formulate a new problem, called Group Utility Maximization (GUM), to summarize the entire user population through k user groups and l items for each group; the goal is to maximize the total utility of selected items over all groups collectively. We show this problem is NP-hard even for l=1. We present two algorithms.

To manage big data and enable analytics at the edge of the network, large amount of computation power is required to perform the computation intensive tasks. However, the energy-constrained IoT devices are not able to perform the computation tasks without compromising the quality-of-service of the applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network in which users can fully offload their computation tasks to edge servers through coded edge offloading or perform local computation with the wireless power transfer derived from coalitions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as mobile charging stations.

In this paper, we introduce the concepts of relation path coverage and relation path confidence to filter out unreliable paths prior to model training to elevate the model performance. Moreover, we propose Knowledge Reasoning Sentence Transformer (KRST) to predict inductive relations in KGs. KRST is designed to encode the extracted reliable paths in KGs, allowing us to properly cluster paths and provide multi-aspect explanations. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that compared to SOTA models, KRST achieves the best performance in most transductive and inductive test cases (4 of 6), and in 11 of 12 few-shot test cases.", "When users move in a physical space (e.g., an urban space), they would have some records called mobility records (e.g., trajectories) generated by devices such as mobile phones and GPS devices. Naturally, mobility records capture essential information of how users work, live and entertain in their daily lives, and therefore, they have been used in a wide range of tasks such as user profile inference, mobility prediction and traffic management. In this paper, we expand this line of research by investigating the problem of inferring user socioeconomic statuses (such as prices of users\u2019 living houses as a proxy of users\u2019 socioeconomic statuses) based on their mobility records, which can potentially be used in real-life applications such as the car loan business.

All of these participants and stakeholders have a shared goal, which is to gather information on the food production process so that they can make appropriate decisions to increase productivity and reduce risks. However, real-time data collection and analysis continue to be difficult tasks, particularly in developing nations, where agriculture is the primary source of income for the majority of the population. In this paper, we present a smart decision-support system for pig farming. Specifically, we first adopt rail-based unmanned vehicles to capture pigsty images. We then conduct image stitching to avoid double-counting pigs so that we can use image segmentation method to give precise masks for each pig. Based on the segmentation masks, the pig weights can be estimated, and data can be integrated in our developed mobile app. The proposed system enables the above participants and stakeholders to have real-time data and intelligent analysis reports to help their decision-making.", "In offline reinforcement learning (RL), while the majority of efforts are focusing on engineering sophisticated learning algorithms given a fixed dataset, very few works have been carried out to improve the dataset quality itself. More importantly, it is even challenging to collect a task-agnostic dataset such that the offline RL agent can learn multiple skills from it. In this paper, we propose a Curiosity-driven Unsupervised Data Collection (CUDC) method to improve the data collection process. Specifically, we quantify the agent's internal belief to estimate the probability of the k-step future states being reachable from the current states. Different from existing approaches that implicitly assume limited feature space with fixed environment steps, CUDC is capable of adapting the number of environment steps to explore. Thus, the feature representation can be substantially diversified with the dynamics information. With this adaptive reachability mechanism in place, the agent can navigate itself to collect higher-quality data with curiosity. Empirically, CUDC surpasses existing unsupervised methods in sample efficiency and learning performance in various downstream offline RL tasks of the DeepMind control suite.", "This book first presents a tutorial on Federated Learning (FL) and its role in enabling Edge Intelligence over wireless edge networks.

Based on the psychological theory of human curiosity, five collative variables including novelty, uncertainty, complexity, surprisingness, and change, are quantitatively characterized to model artificial curiosity. We seamlessly integrate these collative variables into a regularized single-hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) to encourage curiosity-driven learning.

However, there exists a need for a platform that matches data owners (supply) with model requesters (demand). In this paper, we present CrowdFL, a platform to facilitate the crowdsourcing of FL model training. It coordinates client selection, model training, and reputation management, which are essential steps for the FL crowdsourcing operations. By implementing model training on actual mobile devices, we demonstrate that the platform improves model performance and training efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first platform to support crowdsourcing-based FL on edge devices.", "Item representation learning is crucial for search and recommendation tasks in e-commerce. In e-commerce, the instances (eg, items, users) in different domains are always related. Such instance relationship across domains contains useful local information for transfer learning. However, existing transfer learning based approaches did not leverage this knowledge. In this paper, we report on our experience designing and deploying Prior-Guided Transfer Learning (PGTL) to bridge this gap. It utilizes the instance relationship across domains to extract prior knowledge for the target domain and leverages it to guide the fine-grained transfer learning for e-commerce item representation learning tasks. Rather than directly transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, the prior knowledge can serve as a bridge to link both domains and enhance knowledge transfer, especially when the domain distribution discrepancy is large. Since its deployment on the Taiwanese portal of Taobao in Aug 2020, PGTL has significantly improved the item exposure rate and item click-through rate compared to previous approaches", "Recipe generation from food images and ingredients is a challenging task, which requires the interpretation of the information from another modality. Different from the image captioning task, where the captions usually have one sentence, cooking instructions contain multiple sentences and have obvious structures. To help the model capture the recipe structure and avoid missing some cooking details, we propose a novel framework: Decomposing Generation Networks (DGN) with structure prediction, to get more structured and complete recipe generation outputs. Specifically, we split each cooking instruction into several phases, and assign different sub-generators to each phase. Our approach includes two novel ideas: (i) learning the recipe structures with the global structure prediction component and (ii) producing recipe phases in the sub-generator output component based on the predicted structure.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning, this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications to be developed. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning approaches require the data to be aggregated in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to data privacy. In light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises the challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale.

In this paper, we consider an FL network of model owners and data owners with heterogeneous privacy budgets and preferences respectively. In exchange for their participation in the training, the model owner offers a reward pool that is shared among the data owners that take part in the FL training.

This reduces the instances of global communication and straggling workers. To enable efficient HFL, it is important to address the issues of edge association in the context of non-cooperative players, i.e., workers, edge servers, and model owner. However, the existing studies merely focus on static approaches and do not consider the dynamic interactions and bounded rationalities of the players.

In large-scale search systems, the ranking results are continually improved with the introduction of more factors to be considered by LTR. However, the more factors being considered, the more computation resources required, which in turn, results in increased system response latency. Therefore, removing redundant factors can significantly improve search engine efficiency. In this paper, we report on our experience incorporating our Contextual Factor Selection (CFS) deep reinforcement learning approach into the Taobao e-commerce platform to optimize the selection of factors based on the context of each search query to simultaneously maintaining search result quality while significantly reducing latency. Online deployment on Taobao. com demonstrated that CFS is able to reduce average search latency under everyday use scenarios by more than 40% compared to the previous approach with comparable search result quality.

To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset, the experimental results show that our GEVST model can obtain promising performance gains.", "Noisy labels are commonly found in real-world data, which cause performance degradation of deep neural networks. Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing classification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric learning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper, we bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance Selection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the probability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples. Specifically, we propose a novel method, namely the von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity (vMF-Sim), to calculate this probability by estimating a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution for each data class. Compared with the existing average similarity method (AvgSim), vMF-Sim considers the variance of each class in addition to the average similarity. With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy.

Inspired by knowledge transfer, we propose Converse Attention Network, or CAN in short, to improve the performance of NER in low-resource languages by leveraging the knowledge learned in pretrained high-resource English models. CAN first translates low-resource languages into high-resource English using an attention based translation module. In the process of translation, CAN obtain the attention matrices that align the two languages. Furthermore, CAN use the attention matrices to align the high-resource semantic features from a pretrained high-resource English model with the low-resource semantic features. As a result, CAN obtains aligned high-resource semantic features to enrich the representations of low-resource languages.

This is more challenging than conventional online learning tasks since the learner not only needs to figure out how to effectively update the classifier but also needs to decide when is the best time to query the label of an incoming instance given limited label budget. The existing online active learning approaches are often based on first-order online learning methods which generally fall short in slow convergence rate and suboptimal exploitation of available information when querying the labeled data. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, we present a new framework of Second-order Online Active Learning (SOAL), which fully exploits both first-order and second-order information to achieve high learning accuracy with low labeling cost.

However, it is not well understood how incentives influence crowdsourcing participation. This paper proposes a role fulfilment model from a sociological perspective to understand motivation in crowdsourcing. According to the requesters\u2019 expectation, the participants should take the roles of workers. It means that they should respond effectively in a satisfied quality with serious attitude towards the tasks. However, especially for mundane crowdsourcing tasks, the participants are less likely to take ownership of the tasks. Based on the related role requirements of fun, reward and killing time, they will be less likely to treat tasks seriously.

Traditional Happiness Chart depends on people\u2019s self-report and is unable to produce predictive analysis to facilitate decision-making.

We designed an easy-touse survey questionnaire which can help establish the values of the causal relationship weights to support personalization of the proposed FCM model. The FCM affective model produces two metrics for assessing a given user\u2019s emotional stability: 1) the stable state mood value, and 2) the number of iteration steps for the FCM model to reach equilibrium. The two metrics are evaluated through a real-world experiment involving 20 undergraduate students. The results show that they are strong explanation factors for a user\u2019s emotional stability with 99% confidence. A regression model based on the user study has also been presented in the paper to help researchers study the relationships between the two metrics and a person\u2019s emotional stability computationally in the future.", "Game theoretic models of security, and associated computational methods, have emerged as critical components of security posture across a broad array of domains, including airport security and coast guard. These approaches consider terrorists as motivated but independent entities. There is, however, increasing evidence that attackers, be it terrorists or cyber attackers, communicate extensively and form coalitions that can dramatically increase their ability to achieve malicious goals. To date, such cooperative decision making among attackers has been ignored in the security games literature. To address the issue of cooperation among attackers, we introduce a novel coalitional security game (CSG) model. A CSG consists of a set of attackers connected by a (communication or trust) network who can form coalitions as connected subgraphs of this network so as to attack a collection of targets. A defender in a CSG can delete a set of edges, incurring a cost for deleting each edge, with the goal of optimally limiting the attackers\u2019 ability to form effective coalitions (in terms of successfully attacking high value targets). We first show that a CSG is, in general, hard to approximate. Nevertheless, we develop a novel branch and price algorithm, leveraging a combination of column generation, relaxation, greedy approximation, and stabilization methods to enable scalable high-quality approximations of CSG solutions on realistic problem instances.", "Coverage control is one of the most fundamental issues in directional sensor networks. In this paper, the coverage optimization problem in a directional sensor network is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. It takes into account the coverage rate of the network, the number of working sensor nodes and the connectivity of the network. The coverage problem considered in this paper is characterized by the geographical irregularity of the sensed events and heterogeneity of the sensor nodes in terms of sensing radius, field of angle and communication radius. To solve this multi-objective problem, we introduce a learning automata-based coral reef algorithm for adaptive parameter selection and use a novel Tchebycheff decomposition method to decompose the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem.

Learning FHMMs yields a challenging simultaneous model selection issue, i.e., selecting the number of multiple Markov chains and the dimensionality of each chain. Our main contribution is to address this model selection issue by extending Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to FHMMs. First, we offer a better approximation of marginal log-likelihood than the previous FAB inference. Our key idea is to integrate out transition probabilities, yet still apply the Laplace approximation to emission probabilities. Second, we prove that if there are two very similar hidden states in an FHMM, i.e. one is redundant, then FAB will almost surely shrink and eliminate one of them, making the model parsimonious. Experimental results show that FAB for FHMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nonparametric Bayesian iFHMM and Variational FHMM in model selection accuracy, with competitive held-out perplexity.", "Crowdsourcing has shown great potential in obtaining large-scale and cheap labels for different tasks. However, obtaining reliable labels is challenging due to several reasons, such as noisy annotators, limited budget and so on. The state-of-theart approaches, either suffer in some noisy scenarios, or rely on unlimited resources to acquire reliable labels. In this article, we adopt the learning with expert (AKA worker in crowdsourcing) advice framework to robustly infer accurate labels by considering the reliability of each worker. However, in order to accurately predict the reliability of each worker, traditional learning with expert advice will consult with external oracles (AKA domain experts) on the true label of each instance. To reduce the cost of consultation, we proposed two active learning approaches, margin-based and weighted difference of advices based.

Theoretically, we prove the optimal linear convergence rate for the proposed SDCA algorithm, beating the well-known sublinear convergence rate by the previous best metric learning algorithms. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on both standard and large-scale data sets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for retrieval tasks.", "Reputation systems have contributed much to the success of online service provision systems. By using reputation systems, a service consumer can benefit from modeling the behavior of a service provider. However, the problem of unfair testimonies makes it difficult and remains an open issue for the consumer to accurately evaluate the provider's reputation. To address this problem, various approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of unfair testimonies. However, most existing works focus on countering unfair testimonies for reputation systems supporting binary ratings. To resolve this limitation, in this paper, we propose a two-stage clustering approach to filter unfair testimonies, especially for reputation systems using multi-nominal ratings. The proposed approach uses clustering technique to identify unfair testimonies and further contributes to providing the consumer with a more accurate\u00a0\u2026", "To take the advantage of computer-aided learning, more and more educational researchers realize the importance of encouraging teenagers to learn in their virtual life.

We then review representative MAC protocols from the following four categories: contention-based protocols, contention-free (scheduled-based) protocols, hybrid protocols, and preamble sampling protocols. Our discussions focus on the background, main features, operation procedures, major design issues, and the advantages and disadvantages of these protocols.

Most of the existing approaches are based on model checking techniques which require system specification in a formal language. This is an error-prone task and can only be performed by experts who have considerable experiences in logic reasoning. We proposed in this paper an easy-to-use approach to the verification of multi-agent systems based on the Goal Net modeling methodology. Goal Net is a goal-oriented framework which aspires to simplify the process of designing and implementing multi-agent systems. In our approach, a multi-agent system is modeled as a goal net. The goal net and its properties will be automatically converted into FSP (Finite State Processes) specification, which can be automatically verified by the model checker LTSA (Labeled Transition System Analyzer).", "This robot combines advantages of Wi-Fi and robotics technologies to provide daily-life services to people staying at home, the disabled and the elderly.

Therefore, the prescribed quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as bit error rate (BER), can not be guaranteed and the system performance will then be degenerated. In this paper, the resource allocation for wireless transmission with the Doppler effect is investigated, and a new resources allocation method based on the system dynamics is developed. It is shown that, unlike the existing resource allocation methods based on mean feedback, the new method in this paper can not only reduce the effect of imperfect CSI on the given BER, but also improve the efficiency of resource allocation. The wireless systems equipped with the new resource allocation scheme behave with strong robustness with respect to the change of the correlation coefficient. In addition, by properly choosing the control parameters, the scheme can further improve the allocation efficiency with the satisfied QoS. Simulation results are given in support of the good performance of the proposed new scheme.", "Co-intelligence, also known as collective or collaborative intelligence, is the harnessing of human knowledge and intelligence that allows groups of people to act together in ways that seem to be intelligent.

Story plot and character are two most important elements of a story. Based on these two elements, currently there are two research directions: plot-based and character-based interactive storytelling. However, plot-based approach lacks the refinement of character behaviors as character-based approach. On the other side, character-based approach does not follow a well organized story plot so that the moral of the story might be distorted. Therefore, there is a need to develop an integrated framework to achieve the balance between conveying story moral and enhancing the modeling of character behaviors.

Grid, as a pool of computing resources, solves the problem in some degree by providing an integrated computing and resources environment. Thus, there emerge many strategies related to grid resource allocation management (GRAM). However, almost all of these strategies focus on how to allocate the existing computing resources but overlook the possibility of controlling these resources. Therefore, services and computing nodes are always tightly coupled. In this paper, we describe a new framework called GSAF (a grid-based services transfer framework) to solve the problem. GSAF binds services and computing nodes dynamically through services migration and service cache to break the tight coupling.

Semantics sharing has raised big challenges in understanding and interpreting the intended meaning of LCA, LCC and other product data. This paper presents an ontology-driven, standard-based approach to the explicit capture and reuse of product data semantics for heterogeneous information sharing across lifecycle processes in computer aided design, quality assurance, LCA and LCC analysis, and product development process management. The approach incorporates object-based product data modeling, interoperability standardization, and ontology engineering to address the product data semantics sharing issues.

We conduct an extensive set of experiments, in which encouraging results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in comparison to a family of stateof-the-art techniques on a variety of data stream classification tasks.", "Author Index Toggle navigation IEEE Computer Society Digital Library Jobs Tech News \nResource Center Press Room Advertising About Us IEEE IEEE Computer Society IEEE \nComputer Society Digital Library My Subscriptions Magazines Journals Conference Proceedings \nInstitutional Subscriptions IEEE IEEE Computer Society More Jobs Tech News Resource \nCenter Press Room Advertising About Us Cart All Advanced Search Conference Cover Image \nDownload 1.Home 2.Proceedings 3.ica 2018 Author Index 2018, pp. 136-136, DOI Bookmark: \n10.1109/AGENTS.2018.8459916 Keywords Authors Abstract Presents an index of the authors \nwhose articles are published in the conference proceedings record. 136 Author Index Aizawa, \nKazuya, 75 Angelov, Plamen, 44 Arai, Sachiyo, 69, 105, 117 Binmad, Ruchdee, 39 Chen, \nAn-Pin, 113 Chen, Chiao-Ting, 34 Chen, Wei-Lun, 113 Chen, Yu-Ying, 113 Cheng, Charibeth, \u2026", "Automated face annotation aims to automatically detect human faces from a photo and further name the faces with the corresponding human names. In this paper, we tackle this open problem by investigating a search-based face annotation (SBFA) paradigm for mining large amounts of web facial images freely available on the WWW. Given a query facial image for annotation, the idea of SBFA is to first search for top-n similar facial images from a web facial image database and then exploit these top-ranked similar facial images and their weak labels for naming the query facial image. To fully mine those information, this paper proposes a novel framework of Learning to Name Faces (L2NF)\u2013a unified multimodal learning approach for search-based face annotation, which consists of the following major components:(i) we enhance the weak labels of top-ranked similar images by exploiting the \u201clabel smoothness\" assumption;(ii) we construct the multimodal representations of a facial image by extracting different types of features;(iii) we optimize the distance measure for each type of features using distance metric learning techniques; and finally (iv) we learn the optimal combination of multiple modalities for annotation through a learning to rank scheme. We conduct a set of extensive empirical studies on two real-world facial image databases, in which encouraging results show that the proposed algorithms significantly boost the naming accuracy of search-based face annotation task.", "CONTENTS Page 1 Message from Editors-in-Chief i Evolution of Agents in the Case of a \nBalanced Diet Jianran Liu and Wen Ji 1\u20136 Predicting the Entrepreneurial Success of \nCrowdfunding Campaigns Using Model-Based Machine Learning Methods Michael Safo Oduro, \nHan Yu, and Hong Huang 7\u201316 CK-Encoder: Enhanced Language Representation for Sentence \nSimilarity Tao Jiang, Fengjian Kang, Wei Guo, Wei He, Lei Liu, Xudong Lu, Yonghui Xu, and \nLizhen Cui 17\u201322 A Crowd Equivalence-Based Massive Member Model Generation Method for \nCrowd Science Simulations Aoqiang Xing and Hongbo Sun 23\u201333 Energy-Efficient Sensory \nData Collection Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation in IoT Networks Jine Tang, Shuang \nWu, Lingxiao Wei, Weijing Liu, Taishan Qin, Zhangbing Zhou, and Junhua Gu 34\u201343 Credit \nPolicy and Housing Market Liquidity: An Empirical Study in Beijing Based on the TVP-VAR \u2026", "Ahmad, Nooraziah 321 Page 394 Author Index Ahmad, Nooraziah 321 Ayerdi, Borja 289 \nBan, Xiaojuan 81 Bi, Xin 51, 279 Cai, Wenjian 357 Cao, Jianhua 199 Chang, Zheng 81 \nChaudhary, Vikash 115 Chen, Lei 233 Chen, Shuang 279 Chen, Yiqiang 105, 161 Chen, \nZhenyu 105, 161 Cui, Jian 253 Dabas, Neelam 115 Deng, Chenwei 223 Deng, Wan-Yu 343 \nDuan, Lijuan 299 Gan, Emily Yiping 369 Goel, Amita 145 Gra\u00f1a, Manuel 289 Gu, Jun 369 Gu, \nYang 105 Guo, Qingshuan 299 Han, Xiaohong 209 Hu, Lisha 161 Huang, Guang-Bin 223, \n379, 389 Huang, Jiahai 209 Janahiraman, Tiagrajah V. 321 Ji, Lianying 253 Jiang, Chaoyang \n357 Jiang, Xinlong 105, 161 Jiang, Yunliang 179 Lan, Yuan 209 Leung, Cyril 331 Li, Hongbo \n125 Li, Jian 299 Liang, Yunfeng 369 Liao, Shouyi 31 Lin, Feng 369 Lin, Zhiping 369, 379 Liu, \nChang 21 Liu, Huaping 11, 31, 41 Liu, Junfa 105 Liu, Tianchi 379, 389 Liu, Weicong 179 Liu, \u2026", null, "Author name ambiguity has been a long-standing problem which impairs the accuracy of publication retrieval and bibliometric methods. Most of the existing disambiguation methods are built on similarity measures, eg,\u201cJaccard Coefficient\u201d, between two sets of papers to be disambiguated, each set represented by a set of categorical features, eg, coauthors and published venues 1. Such measures perform bad when the two sets are small, which is typical in Author Name Disambiguation. In this paper, we propose a novel categorical set similarity measure. We model an author\u2019s preference, eg, to venues, using a categorical distribution, and derive a likelihood ratio to estimate the likelihood that the two sets are drawn from the same distribution. This likelihood ratio is used as the similarity measure to decide whether two sets belong to the same author. This measure is mathematically principled and verified to perform well even when the cardinalities of the two compared sets are small. Additionally, we propose a new method to estimate the number of distinct authors for a given name based on the name statistics extracted from a digital library. Experiment shows that our method significantly outperforms a baseline method, a widely used benchmark method, and a real system.", "Provides an abstract for each of the invited presentations and a brief professional biography of each presenter.

Agents are able to provide better instructions and stimulate the students conduct the deeper learning. Moreover, they monitor the learning process of the students, which is helpful to provide the customized learning in real-time.

A large scale MAS may have billions of possible ways of organization, depending on the number of agents, the roles, and the relationships among these agents. These characteristics make it impractical to find an optimal choice of organization using exhaustive search methods. In this report, we propose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing hierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm, called the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with a repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic hierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array representation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operator-literate.
