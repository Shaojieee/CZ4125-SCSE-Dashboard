traditional machine learning techniques in the past. In the last few years, deep learning has advanced radically in such a way that it can surpass human-level performance on a number of tasks. As a consequence, deep learning is being extensively used in most of the recent day-to-day applications. However, security of deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model to misclassify the output. In recent times, different types of adversaries based on their threat model leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise a deep learning system where adversaries have high incentives. Hence, it is extremely important to provide robustness to deep learning algorithms against these adversaries. However, there are only a few strong countermeasures which can be used in all types of attack scenarios to design a robust deep learning system. In this paper, we attempt to provide a detailed discussion on different types of adversarial attacks with various threat models and also elaborate the efficiency and challenges of recent countermeasures against them.", "Wireless sensors and actuators connected by the Internet-of-Things (IoT) are central to the design of advanced cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In such complex, heterogeneous systems, communication links must meet stringent requirements on throughput, latency, and range, while adhering to tight energy budget and providing high levels of security. In this paper, we first summarize wireless communication principles from the perspective of the connectivity needs of IoT and CPS. Based on these principles, we then review the most relevant wireless communication standards before focusing on the key security issues and features of such systems. In particular, the gap between the security features in the communication standards used in CPSs and IoT and their actual vulnerabilities are pointed out with practical examples and recent attacks. We emphasize the need for a more in-depth study of the security issues\u00a0\u2026", "Publisher SummaryThis chapter focuses on the language for instruction set architecture (LISA) and its associated tool suite, which is used for exploring the design space of modern embedded processors. LISA supports automatic generation of software tool suites such as C compiler, assembler, linker, simulator, and profiler and optimizes RTL description within a short time, thus accelerating the design space exploration. The ability of LISA to model a wide range of architectures with continuous encompassing of upcoming architectural trends is accompanied by a powerful framework, which delivers production-quality software tools and optimized RTL implementation. The versatility of the language formalism inspires two overlapping use-cases in the electronic system level (ESL) design automation landscape. The first use-case is for abstract architectural simulation, where the focus is on software tool generation and\u00a0\u2026", "We design a distributed platform with blockchain as a system service for supporting transaction execution in insurance processes. The insurance industry is heavily dependent on multiple processes between transacting parties for initiating, maintaining and closing diverse kind of policies. Transaction processing time, payment settlement time and security protection of the process execution are major concerns. Blockchain technology, originally conceived as an immutable distributed ledger for detecting double spending of cryptocurrencies, is now increasingly used in different FinTech systems to address productivity and security requirements. The application of blockchain in FinTech processing requires a deep understanding of the underlying business processes. It supports automated interactions between the blockchain and existing transaction systems through the notion of smart contracts.

Elementary digital circuits, e.g., Boolean arithmetic circuits, can be economically realized within memristive circuits with a limited performance overhead as compared to the standard computation paradigms. This paper takes a major step along this direction by proposing a fully-programmable in-memory computing system. In particular, we address, for the first time, the question of controlling the in-memory computation, by proposing a lightweight unit managing the operations performed on a memristive array. Assembly-level programming abstraction is achieved by a natively-implemented majority and complement operator. This platform enables diverse sets of applications to be ported with little effort. As a case study, we present a standardized symmetric-key cipher for lightweight\u00a0\u2026", "In this work, we demonstrate generic and practical EM side-channel assisted chosen ciphertext attacks over multiple LWE/LWR-based Public Key Encryption (PKE) and Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM) secure in the chosen ciphertext model (IND-CCA security). We show that the EM side-channel information can be efficiently utilized to instantiate a plaintext checking oracle, which provides binary information about the output of decryption, typically concealed within IND-CCA secure PKE/KEMs, thereby enabling our attacks. Firstly, we identified EM-based side-channel vulnerabilities in the error correcting codes (ECC) enabling us to distinguish based on the value/validity of decrypted codewords. We also identified similar vulnerabilities in the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform which leaks information about decrypted messages applicable to schemes that do not use ECC. We subsequently exploit these vulnerabilities to demonstrate practical attacks applicable to six CCA-secure lattice-based PKE/KEMs competing in the second round of the NIST standardization process. We perform experimental validation of our attacks on implementations taken from the open-source pqm4 library, running on the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Our attacks lead to complete key-recovery in a matter of minutes on all the targeted schemes, thus showing the effectiveness of our attack.", "Ensuring nearest neighbor compliance of quantum circuits by inserting SWAP gates has heavily been considered in the past. Here, quantum gates are considered which work on non-adjacent qubits. SWAP gates are applied in order to \u201cmove\u201d these qubits onto adjacent positions. However, a decision how exactly the SWAPs are \u201cmoved\u201d has mainly been made without considering the effect a \u201cmovement\u201d of qubits may have on the remaining circuit. In this work, we propose a methodology for nearest neighbor optimization which addresses this problem by means of a look-ahead scheme. To this end, two representative implementations are presented and discussed in detail. Experimental evaluations show that, in the best case, reductions in the number of SWAP gates of 56% (compared to the state-of-the-art methods) can be achieved following the proposed methodology.", "In this chapter, the mapping of the MESCAL methodology onto the CoWare tool suite is discussed. In order to understand the mapping it is helpful to first understand the key ideas and properties of the tools. First of all, the CoWare tools address both issues of designing and programming a platform: The design of the computational elements as well as their interconnects. The embedded processor designer (LISAT~~~~) allows the user to jointly design the architecture of an ASIP and the software development tools. In LISATek the ASIP is captured by a single model from which the tools (C-compiler, assembler, linker, instruction-set simulator, etc.) and the RTL hardware implementation are generated automatically, thus allowing an iterative design process to evaluate architectural alternatives. The early consideration of C-compiler requirements to the architecture guarantees the successful deployment of the\u00a0\u2026", "Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern, first, due to the increased exposure of the functionality to potential attackers; second, due to the reliance of functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; third, due to the interaction of a single-vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in urban traffic infrastructure. Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV\u00a0\u2026", "With diverse types of emerging devices offering simultaneous capability of storage and logic operations, researchers have proposed novel platforms that promise gains in energy-efficiency. Such platforms can be classified into two domains - application-specific and general-purpose. The application-specific in-memory computing platforms include machine learning accelerators, arithmetic units, and Content Addressable Memory (CAM)-based structures. On the other hand, the general-purpose computing platforms stem from the idea that several in-memory computing logic devices do support a universal set of Boolean logic operation and therefore, can be used for mapping arbitrary Boolean functions efficiently. In this direction, so far, researchers have concentrated on challenges in logic synthesis (e.g. depth optimization), and technology mapping (e.g. device count reduction).

In this paper, we present a systematic study of the hardware implementation of RC4, and propose the fastest known architecture for the cipher. We combine the ideas of hardware pipeline and loop unrolling to design an architecture that produces 2 RC4 keystream bytes per clock cycle. We have optimized and implemented our proposed design using VHDL description, synthesized with 130, 90, and 65 nm fabrication technologies at clock frequencies 625 MHz, 1.37 GHz, and 1.92 GHz, respectively, to obtain a final RC4 keystream throughput of 10, 21.92, and 30.72 Gbps in the respective technologies.", "This chapter covers state-of-the art specification languages, tools, and methodologies for processor development in academia as well as industry. Time-to-market pressure coupled with short-product lifetimes create a critical need for design automation in processor development. The processor is modeled using a specification language such as Architecture Description Language (ADL). The ADL specification is used to generate various tools (eg, simulators, compilers and debuggers) to enable exploration and validation of candidate architectures. The goal is to find the best possible processor architecture for the given set of application programs under various design constraints such as cost, area, power and performance. The ADL specification is also used to perform various design automation tasks including hardware generation and functional verification of the processor.", "Profiled side-channel attacks represent a practical threat to digital devices, thereby having the potential to disrupt the foundation of e-commerce, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. In the profiled side-channel attack, the adversary gains knowledge about the target device by getting access to a cloned device. Though these two devices are different in realworld scenarios, yet, unfortunately, a large part of research works simplifies the setting by using only a single device for both profiling and attacking. There, the portability issue is conveniently ignored to ease the experimental procedure. In parallel to the above developments, machine learning techniques are used in recent literature, demonstrating excellent performance in profiled side-channel attacks. Again, unfortunately, the portability is neglected. In this paper, we consider realistic side-channel scenarios and commonly used machine learning techniques to evaluate the influence of portability on the efficacy of an attack. Our experimental results show that portability plays an important role and should not be disregarded as it contributes to a significant overestimate of the attack efficiency, which can easily be an order of magnitude size. After establishing the importance of portability, we propose a new model called the Multiple Device Model (MDM) that formally incorporates the device to device variation during a profiled side-channel attack. We show through experimental studies how machine learning and MDM significantly enhance the capacity for practical side-channel attacks. More precisely, we demonstrate how MDM can improve the performance of an attack by order of magnitude\u00a0\u2026", "Drones present a novel airborne platform for new commercial and consumer tasks. Due to their increasing use, security analysis has become necessary. In this paper, we present a collection of fatal attacks, minor observations and associated security vulnerabilities for DJI Phantom 4 Pro(P4P) and Parrot Bebop 2 drones. We also propose some countermeasures to bolster the security of the analyzed drones. In addition to this, we provided a brief overview of the system and embedded architecture of these vehicles. Although DJI has tried to improve security by introducing radio communication and partially encrypted firmware, the P4P still remains vulnerable to GPS spoofing, jamming and other vulnerabilities through DJI-SDK has been exposed in our experimental study. In contrast, Bebop drones are more vulnerable to wireless attacks and we have experimentally validated this for Bebop 2 drone.", "Static timing analysis provides the basis for setting the clock period of a microprocessor core, based on its worst-case critical path. However, depending on the design, this critical path is not always excited and therefore dynamic timing margins exist that can theoretically be exploited for the benefit of better speed or lower power consumption (through voltage scaling). This paper introduces predictive instruction-based dynamic clock adjustment as a technique to trim dynamic timing margins in pipelined microprocessors. To this end, we exploit the different timing requirements for individual instructions during the dynamically varying program execution flow without the need for complex circuit-level measures to detect and correct timing violations. We provide a design flow to extract the dynamic timing information for the design using post-layout dynamic timing analysis and we integrate the results into a custom cycle\u00a0\u2026", "Redox-based resistive switching random access memory (ReRAM) offers excellent properties to implement future non-volatile memory arrays.

Here, we report on seven-states Tantalum Oxide Devices, which enable the realization of an intrinsic modular arithmetic using a ternary number system. Modular arithmetic, a fundamental system for operating on numbers within the limit of a modulus, is known to mathematicians since the days of Euclid and finds applications in diverse areas ranging from e-commerce to musical notations.

Adaptability, in its complete strength, is present in reconfigurable processors, which makes it an important IP in modern System-on-Chips (SoCs). Reconfigurable processors have risen to prominence as a dominant computing platform across embedded, general-purpose, and high-performance application domains during the last decade. Significant advances have been made in many areas such as, identifying the advantages of reconfigurable platforms, their modeling, implementation flow and finally towards early commercial acceptance. This paper reviews these progresses from various perspectives with particular emphasis on fundamental challenges and their solutions.

Such interconnection would enable fast and secure data transfer, sharing of the analytics information for various purposes like wide area monitoring, faster outage recovery, blackout prevention, distributed state estimation, etc. This would require strong focus on communication security, both at system level as well as at embedded device level. Although communication level security is dealt in IEC 62351, implementation attack on the embedded system is not considered.

As per the latest statistics, more than half of malwares reported in Q1 of 2017 are ransomwares and there is a potent threat of a novice cybercriminals accessing ransomware-as-a-service. The concept of public-key based data kidnapping and subsequent extortion was introduced in 1996. Since then, variants of ransomware emerged with different cryptosystems and larger key sizes, the underlying techniques remained same. Though there are works in literature which proposes a generic framework to detect the crypto ransomwares, we present a two step unsupervised detection tool which when suspects a process activity to be malicious, issues an alarm for further analysis to be carried in the second step and detects it with minimal traces. The two step detection framework- RAPPER uses Artificial Neural Network and Fast Fourier Transformation to develop a highly accurate, fast and reliable solution to ransomware detection using minimal trace points. We also introduce a special detection module for successful identification of disk encryption processes from potential ransomware operations, both having similar characteristics but with different objective. We provide a comprehensive solution to tackle almost all scenarios (standard benchmark, disk encryption and regular high computational processes) pertaining to the crypto ransomwares in light of software security.", "A significant hurdle towards realization of practical and scalable quantum computing is to protect the quantum states from inherent noises during the computation. In physical implementation of quantum circuits, a long-distance interaction between two qubits is undesirable since, it can be interpreted as a noise. Therefore, multiple quantum technologies and quantum error correcting codes strongly require the interacting qubits to be arranged in a nearest neighbor (NN) fashion. The current literature on converting a given quantum circuit to an NN-arranged one mainly considered chained qubit topologies or Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) topology. However, practical quantum circuit realizations, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), may not have an LNN topology. To address this gap, we consider an arbitrary qubit topology. We present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for achieving minimal logical depth while guaranteeing the nearest neighbor arrangement between the interacting qubits. We substantiate our claim with studies on diverse network topologies and prominent quantum circuit benchmarks.", "Rapid advancement in the domain of quantum technologies have opened up researchers to the real possibility of experimenting with quantum circuits, and simulating small-scale quantum programs. Nevertheless, the quality of currently available qubits and environmental noise pose a challenge in smooth execution of the quantum circuits. Therefore, efficient design automation flows for mapping a given algorithm to the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer becomes of utmost importance. State-of-the-art quantum design automation tools are primarily focused on reducing logical depth, gate count and qubit counts with recent emphasis on topology-aware (nearest-neighbour compliance) mapping. In this work, we extend the technology mapping flows to simultaneously consider the topology and gate fidelity constraints while keeping logical depth and gate count as optimization objectives.

For this reason, design parameters such as timing, area or power consumption cannot be taken into consideration accurately during design space exploration. Design automation tools currently used to bridge this gap are either limited in the flexibility provided or only generate fragments of the architecture. This paper presents a synthesis tool which preserves the full flexibility of the architecture description language LISA, while being able to generate the complete architecture on RT-level using systemC. This paper also presents two real world architecture case studies to prove the feasibility of our approach.", "The recent lattice-based signature scheme Dilithium, submitted as part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) package, is one of a number of strong candidates submitted for the NIST standardisation process of post-quantum cryptography. The Dilithium signature scheme is based on the Fiat-Shamir paradigm and can be seen as a variant of the Bai-Galbraith scheme (BG) combined with several improvements from previous ancestor lattice-based schemes like GLP and BLISS signature schemes. One of the main features of Dilithium is the compressed public-key, which is a rounded version of the LWE instance. This implies that Dilithium is not breakable with the knowledge of only the secret or the error of the LWE instance, unlike its ancestor lattice-based signature schemes. In this paper, we investigate the security of Dilithium against a combination of side-channel and classical attacks. Side-channel attacks on schoolbook and optimised polynomial multiplication algorithms in the signing procedure are shown to extract the secret component of the LWE instance, which is just one among the multiple components of the secret-key of Dilithium. We then propose an alternative signing procedure, through which it is possible to forge signatures with only the extracted portion of the secret-key, without requiring the knowledge of all its elements. Thus showing that Dilithium too breaks on just knowing the secret portion of the LWE instance, similar to previous lattice-based schemes.", "During the last years, the growing application complexity, design, and mask costs have compelled embedded system designers to increasingly consider partially reconfigurable application-specific instruction set processors (rASIPs) which combine a programmable base processor with a reconfigurable fabric. Although such processors promise to deliver excellent balance between performance and flexibility, their design remains a challenging task. The key to the successful design of a rASIP is combined architecture exploration of all the three major components: the programmable core, the reconfigurable fabric, and the interfaces between these two. This work presents a design flow that supports fast architecture exploration for rASIPs. The design flow is centered around a unified description of an entire rASIP in an architecture description language (ADL).

For example, circuit optimization based on majority operators enables superior results as compared to traditional synthesis tools. Also, the Boolean satisfiability problem finds new solution approaches when described in terms of majority decisions. To support computer logic applications based on majority, a sound and complete set of axioms is required. Most of the recent advances in majority logic deal only with ternary majority (MAJ-3) operators because the axiomatization with solely MAJ-3 and complementation operators is well understood. However, it is of interest extending such axiomatization to   -ary majority operators (MAJ-   ) from both the theoretical and practical perspective. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a sound and complete axiomatization of MAJ-    logic.

Over the years several TI techniques have been proposed for randomizing cipher execution using different variations of secret-sharing and implementation techniques. For instance, sharing without decomposition (4-shares) is the most straightforward implementation of the threshold countermeasure. However, its usage is limited due to its high area requirements. On the other hand, sharing using decomposition (3-shares) countermeasure for cubic non-linear functions significantly reduces area and complexity in comparison to 4-shares. Nowadays, security of ciphers using a side channel countermeasure is of utmost importance.

We show that simple faults targeting the usage of nonce can result in a nonce-reuse scenario which allows key recovery and message recovery attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first practical fault attack on lattice-based Key encapsulation schemes secure in the CCA model.

This has therefore produced a total of five implementations of SHA-3 which are denoted as Cases I-V in both FPGA and ASIC. Considering the trade-offs between the performance and hardware cost, the best architecture in term of the throughput and area efficiency is identified in Case V. The architecture has the highest throughput of 16.51 Gbps and area efficiency of 11.47 Mbps/slices for the FPGA implementation.

Certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted third parties that issue these certificates. However, the CA ecosystem is fragile and prone to compromises. Starting with Google's Certificate Transparency project, a number of research works have recently looked at adding transparency for better CA accountability, effectively through public logs of all certificates issued by certification authorities, to augment the current X.509 certificate validation process into SSL/TLS. In this paper, leveraging recent progress in blockchain technology, we propose a novel system, called CTB, that makes it impossible for a CA to issue a certificate for a domain without obtaining consent from the domain owner. We further make progress to equip CTB with certificate revocation\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents the first practical fault attack on the ChaCha family of addition-rotation-XOR (ARX)-based stream ciphers.

We use the instruction skip and instruction replacement fault models, which are popularly mounted on microcontroller-based cryptographic implementations. We corroborate the attack propositions via practical fault injection experiments using a laser-based setup targeting an Atmel AVR 8-bit microcontroller-based implementation of ChaCha.

This new stream cipher has a state that is a little larger than the state of Trivium to accommodate a 128-bit secret key and IV. Our pairwise independent hash is also an adaptation of the EHC or \u201cEncode-Hash-Combine\u201d hash, that requires the optimum number of field multiplications and hence requires small hardware footprint.

The detection algorithms also support different antenna configurations and modulation schemes. The rASIP is based on a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA), which is designed for efficient architectural support of matrix operations. A matrix inversion algorithm, which is used for the preprocessing of different detection algorithms, is mapped on the CGRA.

We show the practical applicability of the algorithms in different scenarios using two different implementation approaches. Moreover, we achieve highly efficient realization of computationally expensive operations such as NTT (Number Theoretic Transform), matrix multiplication, and Keccak. Since, these are the most common operations in lattice-based cryptographic algorithms, the techniques presented in this article will likely benefit other similar algorithms.

This increase in the abstraction level traditionally comes at the cost of low performance of the final application specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) implementation, which is generated automatically from the ADL. There is a pressing need for novel optimization techniques for high level synthesis from ADLs, to compensate for this loss of performance.

However the key challenge of programmability is preventing wide-spread adoption. To exploit instruction level parallelism inherent to such architectures, optimal scheduling and mapping of algorithmic kernels is essential. Transforming an input algorithm in the form of a Data Flow Graph (DFG) into a CGRA schedule and mapping configuration is very challenging, due the necessity to consider architectural details such as memory bandwidth requirements, communication patterns, pipelining and heterogeneity to optimally extract maximum performance.

Electronic design automation (EDA) for ICs has focused traditionally on power, performance, and area. However, given the rise of hardware-centric security threats, we believe that EDA must also adopt related notions like secure by design and secure composition of hardware. Despite various promising studies, we argue that some aspects still require more efforts, for example: effective means for compilation of assumptions and constraints for security schemes, all the way from the system level down to the \"bare metal\"; modeling, evaluation, and consideration of security-relevant metrics; or automated and holistic synthesis of various countermeasures, without inducing negative cross-effects.In this paper, we first introduce hardware security for the EDA\u00a0\u2026", "Authenticated encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) plays a significant role in cryptography because of its ability to provide integrity, confidentiality and authenticity at the same time. Due to the emergence of security at the edge of computing fabric, such as, sensors and smartphone devices, there is a growing need of lightweight AEAD ciphers. Currently, a worldwide contest, titled CAESAR, is being held to decide on a set of AEAD ciphers, which are distinguished by their security, run-time performance, energy-efficiency and low area budget. For accurate evaluation of CAESAR candidates, it is of utmost importance to have independent and thorough optimization for each of the ciphers both for their corresponding hardware and software implementations. In this paper, we have carried out an evaluation of the optimized hardware implementation of AEAD ciphers selected in CAESAR third round. We specifically focus on manual optimization of the micro-architecture, evaluations for ASIC technology libraries and the effect of CAESAR APIs on the performances. While these has been studied for FPGA platforms and standalone cipher implementation-to the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed ASIC benchmarking of CAESAR candidates including manual optimization. In this regard, we benchmarked all prior reported designs, including the code generated by high-level synthesis flows. Detailed optimization studies are reported for NORX, CLOC and Deoxys-I.

These attributes are often conflicting. The best performance is obtained from custom designed integrated circuits. In contrast, the maximum flexibility is delivered by a general purpose processor. Among the architecture types emerged over the past years to strike an optimum balance between these two attributes, two are prominent. The first ones are field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based architectures and the second ones are application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs).

Multiple technologies such as Ion-Trap, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), have made great progress in recent years towards a practical Quantum circuit implementation. For all these technologies, in order to suppress the inherent computation noise, fault-tolerance is a desirable feature. Fault tolerance is achieved by Quantum error correction codes, such as surface code.

Surface codes also necessitate the quantum gates to be formed with strict nearest neighbour coupling. State-of-the-art-reversible logic synthesis techniques for quantum circuit implementation do not ensure the logic gates to be formed in a nearest neighbor fashion, and this is handled as a post processing optimization by the insertion of swap gates.

To overcome it, quantum architectures with fault tolerance are desirable. These are achieved currently by using a surface code along with a transversal gate set. This indicates the need for decomposition of universal n-qubit multicontrolled Toffoli (n-MCT) gates using a transversal gate set. Additionally, the transversal non-Clifford phase gate incurs high latency, which makes it an important factor to consider during decomposition. Additionally, the decomposition of a large MCT gate without ancillas presents an additional hurdle. In this paper, we address both of these issues by introducing the Clifford+ Z N gate library.

Since then, variants of ransomware emerged with different cryptosystems and larger key sizes; however, the underlying techniques remained the same. There are several works in the literature which propose a generic framework to detect these ransomwares; though, most of them target ransomwares having specific classes of the encryption algorithm.

These KEMs are IND-CCA secure, that is, they are secure in the chosen-ciphertext model. Our attacks involve the construction of malformed ciphertexts. When decapsulated by the target device, these ciphertexts ensure that a targeted intermediate variable becomes very closely related to the secret key. An attacker, who can obtain information about the secret-dependent variable through side-channels, can subsequently recover the full secret key. We propose several novel CCAs which can be carried through by using side-channel leakage from the decapsulation procedure. The attacks instantiate three different types of oracles, namely a plaintext-checking oracle, a decryption-failure oracle, and a full-decryption oracle, and are applicable to two NTRU-based schemes, which are NTRU and NTRU Prime. The two schemes are candidates in the ongoing NIST standardization process for post-quantum cryptography. We perform experimental validation of the attacks on optimized and unprotected implementations of NTRU-based schemes, taken from the open-source pqm4 library, using the EM-based side-channel on the 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. All of our proposed attacks are capable of recovering the full secret key in only a few thousand chosen ciphertext queries on all parameter sets of NTRU and NTRU Prime. Our attacks, therefore, stress on the need for concrete side-channel protection strategies for NTRU-based KEMs.", "Differential Fault Attack (DFA) is a very well known technique to evaluate security of a stream cipher.

These attacks operate in a chosen-ciphertext setting, and are fairly generic and easy to mount on a given target, as the attacker requires very minimal information about the target device. However, these attacks have an inherent disadvantage of requiring a few thousand traces to perform full key recovery. This is due to the fact that these attacks typically work by recovering a single bit of information about the secret key per query/trace. In this respect, we propose novel parallel PC oracle based side-channel attacks, which are capable of recovering a generic P number of bits of information about the secret key in a single query/trace. We propose novel techniques to build chosen-ciphertexts so as to efficiently realize a parallel PC oracle for Kyber KEM. We also build a multi-class classifier, which is capable of realizing a practical side-channel based parallel PC oracle with very high success rate.

On the other hand, the complexity of such architecture makes it difficult to perform an efficient architecture exploration and application synthesis without tool support.

Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) describe ASIPs on an instructionaccurate or cycle-accurate abstraction level. Accurate information about the physical parameters cannot be obtained on this level of abstraction. For this, a hardware model on Register Transfer Level (RTL) and a subsequent gate-level synthesis is required. Several projects deal with the topic of generating a hardware description model from an ADL. Currently, those approaches focus only on the desired processor core and omit architectural features, such as a debug mechanism or JTAG interface. The acceptance of ASIPs compared to other heterogenous solutions, dedicated to combine performance and flexibility, can only be achieved if well known processor features are supported. In this paper, we propose an automatic generation of JTAG interface and debug mechanism from an ADL.

As such, those devices are often vulnerable to adversarial physical access, enabling a plethora of physical attacks which is a challenge even if such devices are built for security. As cryptography is one of the cornerstones of secure communication among devices, the pertinence of fault attacks is becoming increasingly apparent in a setting where a device can be easily accessed in a physical manner. In particular, two recently proposed fault attacks, Statistical Ineffective Fault Attack (SIFA) and the Fault Template Attack (FTA) are shown to be formidable due to their capability to bypass the common duplication based countermeasures. Duplication based countermeasures, deployed to counter the Differential Fault Attack (DFA), work by duplicating the execution of the cipher followed by a comparison to sense the presence of any effective fault, followed by an appropriate recovery procedure. While a handful of countermeasures are proposed against SIFA, no such countermeasure is known to thwart FTA to date. In this work, we propose a novel countermeasure based on duplication, which can protect against both SIFA and FTA. The proposal is also lightweight with only a marginally additional cost over simple duplication based countermeasures. Our countermeasure further protects against all known variants of DFA, including Selmke, Heyszl, Sigl\u2019s attack from FDTC 2016.

Traditionally, Pearson's correlation coefficient is used for this purpose. We show that a machine learning method is more powerful than the existing correlation coefficient, aside from being simpler to implement. As a proof of concept, we take two variants of Grain-128a (namely a stream cipher, and a stream cipher with authentication), and demonstrate that machine learning can outperform correlation with the same training/testing data.

In this paper, we demonstrate and establish how reversible pebble games can be used to reduce the number of stored temporary results, thereby reducing the qubit count.

To that effect, Compressive Sensing (CS) emerged as a prominent technique for balancing the quality of images/video and the computing/communication overheads. For CS of video data, the Block-based CS (BCS) is typically used due to low complexity. However, while CS reduces the number of samples to be transmitted, the bit-width of each sample increases due to the linear algebraic operations involved in CS, thus making CS less attractive in its pure and straightforward form. To further optimize the use of CS in IoT devices for video sensing, we explore the use of \u03bc-law quantization technique due to its low hardware implementation overhead.

Furthermore, a new learning algorithm is formulated for a neuron with this activation function.

Not just is it useful to break ciphers for malicious applications, but it is also the basis for building secure ones. In fact almost all the ciphers still in use are trusted to be secure mainly due to the fact that many cryptanalysts are trying hard to break them publicly and failing. However, most of the time successful cryptanalytic results end up violating the cipher designers claims, but the attack itself remains theoretical due to the lack of enough resources/algorithms to efficiently implement it. For example, while the first practical SHA-1 collision was found in 2017, most of the ideas and vulnerabilities behind the attack had been discovered in 2005. The internet and IT industries didn't give much attention to the early theoretical results and it wasn't until 2016 that internet browsers starting getting rid of SHA-1.

Despite years of research, the characterization of ICFF for a complex logic network is yet a significantly open problem. In a recent work (Das et al., 2014), a partial characterization of ICFF was done by completely enumerating a subclass of ICFFs, also called the root functions. For 2-level AND-OR logic networks for up to 6-variable the root functions were completely enumerated. This paper significantly extends this line of research by providing a more general framework for handling this class of functions.

However, the complexity of SPL increases for a non-orthogonal measurement matrix. In this paper, we propose a variant of SPL for non-orthogonal matrices without increasing the complexity. In addition, we propose a uniform quantization method for compression of images so as to reduce the communication cost. The performance of the proposed method is comparable to the existing methods for lower measurement rates. This method works particularly well with non-orthogonal random matrices composed of only -1s and +1s.", "Quantum computing necessitates the design of circuits via reversible logic gates. Efficient reversible circuit can be constructed by achieving low ancilla count, reducing logical depth and lowering Quantum costs. Generalized Peres gates have recently been realized with very low Quantum Cost (QC) by utilizing Quantum rotation gates. This is utilized in recent literature for efficient reversible circuit constructions for symmetric Boolean functions. In this paper, we extend this line of construction further by demonstrating efficient realization of adder circuits. In particular, we revisit the adder construction of Vedral, Barenco and Eckert to show that improvement of gate count and QC is achievable by exploiting a construction based only on Peres gates. We also report improved constructions of symmetric Boolean functions by following an approach recently proposed in the context of Boolean function complexity analysis.", "Reversible logic synthesis is emerging as a major research component for post-CMOS computing devices, in particular Quantum computing. In this work, we link the reversible logic synthesis problem to sorting algorithms. Based on our analysis, an alternative derivation of the worst-case complexity of generated reversible circuits is provided. Furthermore, a novel column-wise reversible logic synthesis method, termed RevCol, is designed with inspiration from radix sort. Extending the principles of RevCol, we present a hybrid reversible logic synthesis framework. The theoretical and experimental results are presented. The results are extensively benchmarked with state-of-the-art ancilla-free reversible logic synthesis methods.", "Reversible computation is gaining increasing relevance in the context of several post-CMOS technologies, the most prominent of those being Quantum computing. One of the key theoretical problem pertaining to reversible logic synthesis is the upper bound of the gate count. Compared to the known bounds, the results obtained by optimal synthesis methods are significantly less. In this paper, we connect this problem with the multiplicative complexity analysis of classical Boolean functions. We explore the possibility of relaxing the ancilla and if that approach makes the upper bound tighter. Our results are negative. The ancilla-free synthesis methods by using transformations and by starting from an Exclusive Sum-of-Product (ESOP) formulation remain, theoretically, the synthesis methods for achieving least gate count for the cases where the number of variables  is  and otherwise, respectively.", "Reliability has emerged as an important design criterion due to shrinking device dimensions. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed techniques compromising the Quality-of-Service across all design abstractions.

In this paper, we propose an analytical error prediction framework, based on probabilistic error masking matrices. The prediction is performed by propagating erroneous tokens through abstract logic networks. We report detailed experiments using a RISC processor and several embedded applications.

With increasing data-widths of processors, scalability of stream ciphers is a pertinent issue which is often addressed with ad hoc cipher-specific designs. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for designing stream ciphers with scalable data-widths by combining multiple instances of a single stream cipher following certain principles. We demonstrate using a case study on the fastest software stream cipher HC-128 in the eSTREAM final portfolio to show that the proposed design increases the performance without decreasing the security of the cipher.", "In this paper, we present related quantum algorithms to check the order of resiliency, symmetry and linearity of a Boolean function that is available as a black-box (oracle). First we consider resiliency and show that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be immediately used for this purpose. We also point out how the quadratic improvement in query complexity can be obtained over the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for this purpose using the Grover's technique. While the worst case quantum query complexity to check the resiliency order is exponential in the number of input variables of the Boolean function, we require polynomially many measurements only. We also describe a subset of -variable Boolean functions for which the algorithm works in polynomially many steps, ie, we can achieve an exponential speed-up over best known classical algorithms. A similar kind of approach can be exploited to check whether a Boolean function is symmetric (respectively linear) or not. Given a Boolean function as an oracle, it is important to devise certain algorithms to test whether it has a specific property or it is -far from having that property. The efficiency of the algorithm is judged by the number of calls to the oracle so that one can decide, with high probability, between these two alternatives. We show that this can be achieved in  query complexity. This is obtained by showing that the problem of checking symmetry or linearity can be efficiently reduced to testing whether a Boolean function is constant.", "With increasing usage of hardware accelerators in modern heterogeneous Systemon-Chips (SoCs), the distinction between hardware and software is no longer rigid. The domain of cryptography is no exception and efficient hardware design of so-called software ciphers are becoming increasingly popular. In this paper, for the first time we propose an efficient hardware accelerator design for SOSEMANUK, one of the finalists of the eSTREAM stream cipher competition in the software category. Since SOSEMANUK combines the design principles of the block cipher Serpent and the stream cipher SNOW 2.0, we make our design flexible to accommodate the option for independent execution of Serpent and SNOW 2.0. In the process, we identify interesting design points and explore different levels of optimizations. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of the performance figures of each design point and in each case our figures by far outperform the existing benchmarks. The best throughput achieved by the combined design is 67.84 Gbps for SOSEMANUK, 33.92 Gbps for SNOW 2.0 and 2.12 Gbps for Serpent. The throughput for SOSEMANUK by far outperforms all existing benchmarks on the eSTREAM candidates.", "A huge application domain, in particular, wireless and handheld devices strongly requires flexible and powerefficient hardware with high performance. This can only be achieved with Application Specific Instruction-Set Processors (ASIPs). A key problem is to determine the instruction encoding of the processors for achieving minimum power consumption in the instruction bus and in the instruction memory. In this paper, a framework for determining powerefficient instruction encoding in RISC and VLIW architectures is presented. We have integrated existing and novel techniques in this framework and propose novel heuristic approaches. The framework accepts an existing processor\u2019s instruction-set and a set of implementations of various applications. The output, which is an optimized instruction encoding under the constraint of a well-defined cost model, minimizes the power consumption of the instruction bus and the instruction memory. This results in strong reduction of the overall power consumption. Case studies with commercial embedded processors show the effectiveness of this framework.", "LISA was, is and will be a sweetheart. I mean, the language LISA. From late 2002 till today, it provided a cozy atmosphere for me to keep on imagining and experimenting. I thought of things, which processor designers will be afraid to implement, simply because of its complexity. It was just few tweaks, few keywords in LISA. I am deeply grateful to all those, who thought of ADL at the first place and in particular LISA. Without that, this research would not be possible. I am grateful to the persons who helped me to grasp LISA (thanks to Oliver, David, Manuel, Diandian), to the persons who incessantly questioned me on the abilities of LISA (thanks to Harold, Marcel, Bastian, Maximillian, Benedikt, Diandian, Zoltan) and of course to those who led parallel efforts to extend the language, unknowingly igniting my spirit from time to time (thanks to Tim, Oliver, David, Martin, Torsten, Gunnar, Achim, Kingshuk).Brainstorming is an important research ingredient. I was fortunate to have co-students, who were always eager to listen to my numerous wacky-tacky ideas and correct me ruthlessly. I especially remember David, Kingshuk and Martin, without whom, I would probably waste experimenting to find out that I was wrong. David is the guy, who helped to design a basic block of this work. He made sure that his component movement is working, even when it was hardly needed for him to do so. Harold worked hard in parallel with me to make sure that the case studies work.

The underlying security assumptions of these primitives are such that the currently best known algorithms (classical and quantum alike) cannot break it. Since the digital signature schemes which are commonly used in today\u2019s electronic communication are not considered secure enough against the quantum computers, there is a push for the so-called post-quantum signatures. Based on the existing literature, we can see a variety of post-quantum signatures, like hash based [13, 11, 2, 16], lattice based [9, 8], code based [14], multivariate polynomial based [6, 15], isogeny based [5]. Each of the varieties has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which post-quantum signature scheme to use will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. Among these, hash based signatures are considered promising. The concept of hash functions is quite well-known/well-studied in the symmetric key cryptography over the past couple of decades, this gives an edge for these signatures. Symmetric key ciphers typically are known to be quantum resistant (see, eg,[12]), it makes intuitive sense to use those ciphers for post-quantum application scenario.", "During the last decade, there has been a stunning progress in the domain of AI with adoption in both safety-critical and security-critical applications. A key requirement for this is highly trained Machine Learning (ML) models, which are valuable Intellectual Property (IP) of the respective organizations. Naturally, these models have become targets for model recovery attacks through side-channel leakage. However, majority of the attacks reported in literature are either on simple embedded devices or assume a custom Vivado HLS based FPGA accelerator. On the other hand, for commercial neural network accelerators, such as Google TPU, Intel Compute Stick and NVDLA, there are relatively fewer successful attacks. Focussing on that direction, in this work, we study the vulnerabilities of commercial open-source accelerator NVDLA and present the first successful model recovery attack.

These devices operate in environments that have limited resources. To ensure security, stream ciphers are implemented on hardware due to their speed and simplicity. Amongst different stream ciphers, the eSTREAM ciphers stand due to their frugal implementations. This work probes the effect of unrolling on the efficiency of eSTREAM ciphers, including Trivium, Grain (Grain 80 and Grain 128) and MICKEY (MICKEY 2.0 and MICKEY-128 2.0). It addresses the question of optimal unrolling for designing high-performance stream ciphers. The increase in the area consumption is also bench-marked. The analysis is conducted to identify efficient design principles for ciphers. We experimentally show that the resulting performance after unrolling may disagree with the theoretical prediction when the effects of technology library are considered. We report pre-layout synthesis results on 65 and 130 nm ASIC technology as well as synthesis results for Xilinx FPGA platform in support of our claim.

Our fault attack, based on a practical bit flip model (single bit flip to very few bit flips for proposed parameter instantiations) enables us to retrieve the secret key from the public key in a trivial manner. We fault the nonce in order to maliciously use the same nonce to generate both the secret and error components which turns the LWE instance into an exactly defined set of linear equations from which the secret can be trivially solved for using Gaussian elimination.", "Memristive devices have been shown to have low leakage power, non-volatile storage capability and high storage density.

After a thorough analysis of the possible weaknesses, Spritz, a new stream cipher is proposed to that effect by the author of RC4. The design of Spritz is based on Cryptographic Sponge construction, which permits Spritz to be used in different modes, and therefore, makes it an attractive design choice for security protocols. Initial software performance analysis of Spritz shows that it fares poorly compared to the state-of-the-art hash functions and stream ciphers. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the hardware performance. We propose a fully customized accelerator design for Spritz and identify the highest achievable runtime performance for ASIC and FPGA technology. Our results show that the Spritz accelerator is significantly faster in encryption compared to the software implementation (32.38\u00d7 speed-up for the SQUEEZE and 64.07\u00d7 speed-up for the ABSORB function), though fares weakly against hardware implementation of state-of-the-art hash functions and stream ciphers in terms of area-efficiency.", "Spin-based memory devices offer multiple benefits, like, zero standby power, fast operation speed and high write endurance.

Over the past few years, research has shown RRAM as one of the most suitable candidates for designing efficient, intelligent and secure computing system in the post-CMOS era. In this manuscript, the journey and the device engineering of RRAM with a special focus on the resistive switching mechanism are detailed. This review also focuses on the RRAM based on two-dimensional (2D) materials, as 2D materials offer unique electrical, chemical, mechanical and physical properties owing to their ultrathin, flexible and multilayer structure. Finally, the applications of RRAM in the field of neuromorphic computing are presented.", "We propose a lightweight block cipher named BAKSHEESH, which follows up on the popular cipher GIFT-128 (CHES'17). BAKSHEESH runs for 35 rounds, which is 12.50 percent smaller compared to GIFT-128 (runs for 40 rounds) while maintaining the same security claims against the classical attacks. The crux of BAKSHEESH is to use a 4-bit SBox that has a non-trivial Linear Structure (LS). An SBox with one or more non-trivial LS has not been used in a cipher construction until DEFAULT (Asiacrypt'21). DEFAULT is pitched to have inherent protection against the Differential Fault Attack (DFA), thanks to its SBox having 3 non-trivial LS. BAKSHEESH, however, uses an SBox with only 1 non-trivial LS; and is a traditional cipher just like GIFT-128, with no claims against DFA. The SBox requires a low number of AND gates, making BAKSHEESH suitable for side channel countermeasures (when compared to GIFT-128) and other niche applications. Indeed, our study on the cost of the threshold implementation shows that BAKSHEESH offers a few-fold advantage over other lightweight ciphers. The design is not much deviated from its predecessor (GIFT-128), thereby allowing for easy implementation (such as fix-slicing in software). However, BAKSHEESH opts for the full-round key XOR, compared to the half-round key XOR in GIFT. Thus, when taking everything into account, we show how a cipher construction can benefit from the unique vantage point of using 1 LS SBox, by combining the state-of-the-art progress in classical cryptanalysis and protection against device-dependent attacks. We, therefore, create a new paradigm of lightweight ciphers, by\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents``SASQUATCH'', an open-source tool, that aids in finding an unknown substitution box (SBox) given its properties. The inspiration of our work can be directly attributed to the DCC 2022 paper by Lu, Mesnager, Cui, Fan and Wang. Taking their work as the foundation (ie, converting the problem of SBox search to a satisfiability modulo theory instance and then invoking a solver), we extend in multiple directions (including--but not limiting to--coverage of more options, imposing time limit, parallel execution for multiple SBoxes, non-bijective SBox), and package everything within an easy-to-use interface. We also present ASIC benchmarks for some of the SBoxes.", "Designing a processor is an arduous task. It involves not only defining the instruction-set architecture but also the various processor development tools such as compiler, instruction-set simulator, debugger, assembler, and linker. Moreover, an efficient hardware implementation of the entire microarchitecture is needed apart from verifying the entire design at every step while meeting various end user constraints. These tasks were traditionally done by various specialized teams, originating from an informal processor specification, which posed a significant challenge of maintaining design performance and consistency. The emergence of Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) addressed this challenge. In this chapter, the background of processor design automation flows and how ADLs fit into this narrative are discussed. Prominent ADLs, including commercial ones, are summarized to provide an idea about the\u00a0\u2026", "Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have proven to be a major contributor for the lack of actual deployment and adoption of ML in many practical use-cases. They have been found to be equally lethal in video streams as they are in images and texts. This finds particular relevance in the domain of autonomous driving tasks, which make use of object recognition neural architectures. In this paper, we take a step back from the cat and mouse chase of novel attacks and ad-hoc defenses and try to explain adversarial attacks from the perspective of the geometry of the high-dimensional spaces that the models operate in. Additionally, we make use of our idea of relating adversarial attacks to dimensionality to propose a counter-measure that uses dimension reduction.

The requirement of such a large dataset is usually met by pooling data from various sources, which is often difficult to implement in practice due to strict data privacy constraints. Peer-to-Peer federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm with a primary goal of learning a well-performing global model by collaboratively learning a shared model at different data hubs without the need of sharing data. Due to its immense practical applications, there is a growing attention towards various challenges of efficient federated learning including communication efficiency, assumptions on connectivity, data heterogeneity, enhanced privacy, etc. In this paper, we address the communication efficiency of Peer-to-Peer federated learning, modeling it using a graph theoretical framework. We show that one can draw from a range of graph-based algorithms to construct an efficient communication algorithm on a connected network, thereby matching the inference efficiency of centralized federated learning as well as that of a consolidated dataset. We conduct experiments with varied graph formations and sizes to validate our claims.", "Hardware Trojans (HTs) are malicious manipulations of the standard functionality of an integrated circuit (IC). Sophisticated defense against HT attacks has become the utmost current research endeavor. In particular, the HTs whose operations depend on the rare activation condition are the most critical ones.

In this paper, we focus on the vulnerability of SIKE against fault attacks, specifically against loop abort fault attacks. The fault attacks proposed in this paper can be applied to both naive and optimized implementations of large degree isogeny computation. The attack on naive implementation is based on creating loop abort faults during scalar multiplication and isogeny computation. The effectiveness of such loop abort faults is twofold: it can transform the post-quantum hardness of SIKE to a post-quantum vulnerable ECDLP (Elliptic Curve Discrete Log), while in the\u00a0\u2026", "This book contains extended and revised versions of the best papers presented at the 29th IFIP WG 10.5/IEEE International Conference on Very Large Scale Integration, VLSI-SoC 2021, held in Singapore, in October 2021*.

Typically, EDA flows consist of multiple phases. Technology-independent logic synthesis is the first step, where the input Boolean function is restructured without any specific technology constraints, which is generally followed by a technology-dependent optimization phase, where technology specific hints are used for optimization of the data structure obtained from the first step. The final step is technology mapping, which takes the optimized function representation to implement it using technology-specific constraints.

In one of the key applications, several studies have proposed construction of finite automata using DNA hybridisation and ligation. The state and symbol encoding of these finite automata are done manually. In this manuscript, we study the codeword construction problem for this approach. We derive exact theoretical bounds on the number of symbols and states in the finite automata and also obtain the complete set of symbols in a specific case. For automatic encoding, two different solutions, based on a heuristic and on Integer Linear Programming (ILP), are proposed.

As a result, optimising the linear layer for device implementation has been an important research direction for about two decades. The Boyar-Peralta\u2019s algorithm (SEA\u201910) is one such common algorithm, which offers significant improvement compared to the straightforward implementation. This algorithm only returns implementation with XOR2 gates, and is deterministic. Over the last couple of years, some improvements over this algorithm has been proposed, so as to make support for XOR3 gates as well as make it randomised. In this work, we take an already existing improvement (Tan and Peyrin, TCHES\u201920) that allows randomised execution and extend it to support three input XOR gates. This complements the other work done in this direction (Banik et al., IWSEC\u201919) that also supports XOR3 gates with randomised execution. Further, noting from another work (Maximov, Eprint\u201919), we include one additional tie-breaker condition in the original Boyar-Peralta\u2019s algorithm.

We believe that a useful analytical modeling tool for PIM can play a crucial role in addressing this challenge. An analytical tool in this context has many potential uses, such as in (i) evaluation of applications mapped to PIM,(ii) comparison of PIM versus traditional architectures, and (iii) analysis of the implications of new memory technology trends on PIM.

Carefully crafted perturbations, imperceptible to human vision, can be added to images to force misclassification by an otherwise high performing neural network. To have a better understanding of the key contributors of such structured attacks, we searched for and studied spatially co-located patterns in the distribution of pixels in the input space. In this paper, we propose a framework for segregating and isolating regions within an input image which are particularly critical towards either classification (during inference), or adversarial vulnerability or both. We assert that during inference, the trained model looks at a specific region in the image, which we call Region of Importance (RoI); and the attacker looks at a region to alter/modify, which we call Region of Attack (RoA). The success of this approach could also be used to design a post-hoc adversarial defence method, as illustrated by our observations. This uses the notion of blocking out (we call neutralizing) that region of the image which is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks but is not important for the task of classification. We establish the theoretical setup for formalising the process of segregation, isolation and neutralization and substantiate it through empirical analysis on standard benchmarking datasets. The findings strongly indicate that mapping features into the input space preserves the significant patterns typically observed in the feature-space while adding major interpretability and therefore simplifies potential defensive mechanisms.", "Spintronics presents great promise for efficient processing and storage of information in the post-Moore era, thanks to its attributes of non-volatility, excellent integration-density, near-unlimited endurance and compatibility with CMOS process-technology.

In such situations, accurate aneuploidy profiling of cancer data is critical for calibration of copy number (CN)-detection tools. Additionally, cancer cell populations suffer from different levels of clonal heterogeneity and aneuploidy alterations over time. The degree of heterogeneity adversely affects the segregation of the depth of coverage (DOC) signal into integral CN states. This, in turn, strongly influences the reliability of this data for ploidy profiling and copy number variation (CNV) analysis.ResultsWe developed AStra framework for aneuploidy profiling of cancer data and assessing their suitability for copy number analysis without any prior knowledge of the input sequencing data. AStra estimates the best-fit aneuploidy profile as the spectrum with most genomic segments around integral CN states. We employ this spectrum to extract the CN-associated features such as the homogeneity score (HS), whole-genome ploidy level, and CN correction factor. The HS measures the percentage of genomic regions around CN states. It is used as a reliability assessment of sequencing data for downstream aneuploidy profiling and CNV analysis. We evaluated the accuracy of AStra using 31 low-coverage datasets from 20 cancer cell lines. AStra successfully identified the aneuploidy spectrum of complex cell lines with HS greater than 75%.

Advanced linear and non-linear randomized encoding can be employed for constructing varying CED schemes. In this chapter, we provide an automated evaluation method to estimate the detection capability of both linear and non-linear parity-protected ciphers in the presence of fault attacks. The method takes the device characteristics into account to provide accurate results on fault coverage. Case study on PRESENT-80 CED-protected implementation is provided to show the usage and practicality of such method.", "The Conference on Security, Privacy, and Applied Cryptography Engineering 2018 (SPACE 2018), was held during December 15\u201319, 2018, at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India.

Neuromorphic circuits using domain wall motion-based threshold neurons have been demonstrated in previous studies. However, threshold neurons are unable to realize linearly inseparable functions. Our work addresses this challenge by proposing a new domain wall motion-based neural activation unit with XOR-like activation function. We also develop a new learning algorithm for neurons with this activation unit. Offline training is performed on real-world datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Neuromorphic circuits corresponding to these datasets are also simulated.

The main goal of this competition is to find smaller, faster and energy-efficient authenticated encryption schemes. In this paper, an area efficient hardware implementation of CLOC, one of the 15 candidates for the third round of CAESAR competition is presented. CLOC represents a new mode of using AES, in order to provide both encryption/decryption and MAC functionalities. Since the hardware design of AES is a well studied problem, the challenge is to accommodate the mode functionality with small area, high performance and low power overhead. The proposed hardware implementation for the CLOC is developed by sharing the AES core by applying a pipeline technique.

Serpentinites, being frictionally weak due to its structure, and composed of hydrous minerals, thus play a pivotal role in controlling the fault rheology in ocean and continental rift settings to subduction settings (eg Viti et al., 2018). Thus, depending on the type of serpentine mineral present and deformation mechanisms observed, paleo deformational conditions of a particular region can be discerned.Rakhabdev lineament, is a NW-SE trending belt belonging to Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup in north-western part of India (Roy et. al., 1988), primarily exposed around Rakhabdev and Kherwara in South eastern Rajasthan. This belt lies along the boundary between shelf facies (in eastern part) and deep-water facies (in the western part)(Roy et al., 1988; Gupta et al., 1997). There is a considerable debate over the evolution mechanism of the ultramafic rocks of this belt. One view suggested that the ultramafic rocks are component of dismembered ophiolite sequence (Gupta et al., 1997, Sinha-Roy 1985) while other describes them as concordantly emplaced intrusions along the litho-contacts before and during first phase folding of the Aravalli Supergroup (Roy et al., 1988; Roy and Jakhar, 2002; Sharma, et al., 1988). Current study focusses on outcrop section exhibiting massive ultramafic body at the central zone bounded by the weakly deformed serpentinized layer, followed by strongly deformed serpentinized layer with pervasive calcite veins.

The aim of the research study was to enhance students' learning experience and improve their understanding in the threshold concepts of product design, manufacturing and assembly. As a measure to promote active learning, an educational game was introduced in the problem-solving phase of PF. A 3D puzzle game titled \u201cManufactory\u201d was designed, developed and implemented to assist students in improving their 3D spatial abilities. In order to test the presented framework, an experiment was conducted where students were allocated to either a Productive Failure (PF) or Direct Learning (DL) group. For the PF group, students were first required to solve problems in the puzzle game independently during the problemsolving phase, before instructions were given in the second delayed instruction phase. A conventional teaching approach was conducted for the DL group. Results from the experiment reflected that students in the PF group achieved a distinctive improvement, raising their average score by 40 percent and outperforming students in the DL group with 22 percent greater progression during the post-test. The experiment displayed evidence that the 3D educational game design provided an engaging environment for the problem-solving phase, which served as the primary motivation for effective absorption of the concepts in the delayed instruction phase.", "Computing is an integral part of daily life. We encounter two types of computing devices every day: desktop-based computing devices and embedded computer systems. Desktop-based computing systems encompass traditional computers, including personal computers, notebook computers, workstations, and servers. Embedded computer systems are ubiquitous\u2014they run the computing devices hidden inside a vast array of everyday products and appliances such as smartphones, toys, handheld PDAs, cameras, and cars. Both types of computing devices use programmable components such as processors, coprocessors, and memories to execute application programs. These programmable components are also referred as \u201cprogrammable accelerators.\u201d Figure 8.1 shows an exemplary embedded system with programmable accelerators. Depending on the application domain, the embedded system can have application-specific accelerators, interfaces, controllers, and peripherals. The complexity of the programmable accelerators is increasing at an exponential rate due to technological advances as well as demand for realization of ever more complex applications in communication, multimedia, networking, and entertainment. Shrinking time to market coupled with short product lifetimes creates a critical need for design automation of increasingly sophisticated and complex programmable accelerators.Modeling plays a central role in the design automation of processors.

However, with the proliferation of MIMO technologies, traditional single-core-based solutions are hardly able to fulfill requirements with acceptable power and area cost. The reliance on multi-/many-core system is increasing. Different from the computation-limited single-core-based solutions, multi/many-core systems are often communication-limited. In this paper, aiming at MIMO interference cancellation algorithms, we propose a flexible master-slave-based multiprocessor system-on-chiparchitecture based on a systematically divide-and-conquer approach to optimize the communication problems from the application-, architecture- and programming-levels.

The system has been designed in an iterative process using a dataset of stories to create a general rule that caters to the needs of a large variety of fairy tales. This paper is part of a bigger objective of converting a textual story into animation. For the conversion, there are two major steps. Firstly, the system needs to construct the storyboard, which contains information extracted from the text. Next is to create animations based on the output of the first step.

Choosing the right strategy for SoC design is critical to have maximum business benefit out of the SoC. This tutorial looks at different factors, like cost, application of use, time to market, time in market etc, which can impact the SoC design life-cycle. These factors can affect several parameters like partitioning of SoC functionalities into hardware/software, selection of right hardware platform like FPGA/structured ASIC/ ASIC/ASIP, selection of process node/number of metal layers/package etc. The business factors can even influence design parameters like power gating, multi Vt design, voltage island etc. It can also influence the design methodology like selection of IP, selection of the verification process and usage of high-level design exploration flow etc.", "With the growing market for multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) solutions, application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) gain importance as they allow for a wide tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency in such a system. Their development is aided by architecture description languages (ADLs) supporting the automatic generation of architecture-specific tool sets as well as synthesizable register transfer level (RTL) implementations from a single architecture model. However, these generated implementations have to be manually adapted to the interfaces of dedicated memories or memory controllers, slowing down the design-space exploration regarding the memory architecture. To overcome this drawback, the authors extend RTL code generation from ADL models with the automatic generation of memory interfaces. This is accomplished by introducing a new abstract and versatile description format\u00a0\u2026", "To exploit the spatial parallelism within target applications, various processor architectures are proposed. However, to estimate the scope of parallelism from high-level application remains a daunting task. A re-targetable as well as efficient High-Level Language (HLL) compiler is needed for that purpose. Building such a compiler in the early phase of processor modeling is extremely difficult. This paper proposes efficient techniques to uncover fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism opportunities in a processor without depending on advanced compiler support. The techniques are built upon an Architecture Description Language (ADL)-driven processor exploration framework, which gives feedback to the designer on various performance aspects in the design exploration phase. Experimental studies with modern embedded applications are presented to validate the importance of this work.", "In this chapter, the design space of rASIP is elaborated from an architectural perspective. For each design point, the effect of other design points are highlighted. Consequently, the design space is mapped to the modelling environment.

On the basis of the proposed rASIP description, the overall rASIP design methodology is presented.", null, "With the help of model experiments and theoretical analyses we evaluate the relationships of imbricate thrust spacing (a) with the bed thickness (H), basal friction (u), initial taper (m), and the magnitude (normalized to bed-weight per unit area) of horizontal stress (n). Imbricate thrust spacing increases linearly with bed thickness when m\u2081= 0 and initial-stage thrust imbricates are taken into account. For general cases (m# 0) the variations are nonlinear. In nonlinear variations thrust spacing steadily increases but approaches a stable value. The variations for large m, are complex, where thrust spacing increases to a maximum and then decreases down to a near-stable value. Thrust spacing shows a positive relationship with the dynamic factor, n. With increase in basal friction, thrust spacing decreases. Steepening of early frontal thrusts and formation of back-thrust also depend on the basal friction.", "Considers the relatively unexplored problem of identifying efficient structures for computing matrix determinants, and presents four alternative solutions for this problem with a comprehensive analysis of each of the proposed approaches in respect of computation time and number of processors.< >", "The gneisses of the Sarwar\u2010Junia Fault Zone (SJFZ), in the Mangalwar Gneissic Complex, a part of the Banded Gneissic Complex (BGC\u2010II) of northwest India recorded two phases of metamorphism.

We propose efficient strategies to construct chosen ciphertexts to instantiate the aforementioned oracles to perform full key recovery. We perform experimental validation of our attacks on the optimized implementation of Streamlined NTRU Prime obtained from the pqm4 public library, a testing and benchmarking framework for post quantum cryptographic schemes on the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. We positively confirm that both the PC and DF oracle-based attacks result in full key recovery in a few thousand traces with 100% success rate.
