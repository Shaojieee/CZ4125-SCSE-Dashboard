of cyber attacks in the wireless communications these days. It is thus a challenging task to determine network anomaly more accurately. In this paper, we propose an Autoencoder-based network anomaly detection method. Autoencoder is able to capture the non-linear correlations between features so as to increase the detection accuracy. We also apply the Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) here to perform the dimensionality reduction. As the Convolutional Autoencoder has a smaller number of parameters, it requires less training time compared to the conventional Autoencoder. By evaluating on NSL-KDD dataset, CAE-based network anomaly detection method outperforms other detection methods.", "This paper illustrates the advantages of using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as compared to the standard Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the purpose of removing noise embedded in a speech signal. The derivation of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) filter based on the statistical modelling of the DCT coefficients is shown. Also shown is the derivation of an over-attenuation factor based on the fact that speech energy is not always present in the noisy signal at all times or in all coefficients. This over-attenuation factor is useful in suppressing any musical residual noise which may be present. The proposed methods are evaluated against the noise reduction filter proposed by Y. Ephraim and D. Malah (1984), using both Gaussian distributed white noise as well as recorded fan noise, with favourable results.", "In the Data Grid environment, the primary goal of data replication is to shorten the data access time experienced by the job and consequently reduce the job turnaround time. After introducing a Data Grid architecture that supports efficient data access for the Grid job, the dynamic data replication algorithms are put forward. Combined with different Grid scheduling heuristics, the performances of the data replication algorithms are evaluated with various simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic replication algorithms can reduce the job turnaround time remarkably. In particular, the combination of shortest turnaround time scheduling heuristic (STT) and centralized dynamic replication with response-time oriented replica placement (CDR_RTPlace) exhibits remarkable performance in diverse system environments and job workloads.", "Application level multicasting is increasingly being used to overcome the problem of non-ubiquitous deployment of IP multicast across heterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first papers [A comparative study of application layer multicast protocols, Unpublished report; IEEE Network, January/February, 2003] to provide a comprehensive survey of most of the various milestone research work in application level multicast in terms of both breadth and depth. The paper classifies them into different broad categories based on their topology design, service model and architecture to facilitate better understanding of their contributions and discuss their merits and limitations. As these techniques vary widely in their goals, designs, performance evaluation metrics and evaluation strategies, it is impossible to quantify their relative performance. However, this paper is able to provide a\u00a0\u2026", "Data replication is a common method used to improve the performance of data access in distributed systems. In this paper, two dynamic replication algorithms, Simple Bottom-Up (SBU) and Aggregate Bottom-Up (ABU), are proposed for the multi-tier Data Grid. A multi-tier Data Grid simulator called DRepSim is developed for studying the performances of the dynamic replication algorithms. The simulation results show that both algorithms can reduce the average response time of data access greatly compared to the static replication method. ABU can achieve great performance improvements for all access patterns even if the available storage size of the replication server is very small. Comparing the two algorithms to Fast Spread dynamic replication strategy, ABU proves to be superior.

Most existing ad hoc routing protocols are susceptible to node mobility, especially for large-scale networks. Driven by this issue, we propose an efficient Position-based Opportunistic Routing (POR) protocol which takes advantage of the stateless property of geographic routing and the broadcast nature of wireless medium. When a data packet is sent out, some of the neighbor nodes that have overheard the transmission will serve as forwarding candidates, and take turn to forward the packet if it is not relayed by the specific best forwarder within a certain period of time. By utilizing such in-the-air backup, communication is maintained without being interrupted. The additional latency incurred by local route recovery is greatly reduced and the duplicate relaying caused by packet\u00a0\u2026", "Online social networks have become the hotbeds of many rumors as information can propagate much faster than ever. In order to detect the few but potentially harmful rumors to prevent the public issues they may cause, we propose an unsupervised learning model combining Recurrent Neural Networks and Autoencoders to distinguish rumors as anomalies from other credible microblogs based on users\u2019 behaviors. Some features based on comments posted by other users are newly proposed and are then analyzed over their posting time so as to exploit the crowd wisdom to improve the detection performance.

However, in recent times, online social networks (OSN) have played an increasing significant role as a platform for information sharing. News content posted on these OSN provides very useful insight about public moods. In this paper, we carefully select official accounts from China\u2019s largest online social networks \u2014\u00a0Sina Weibo and analyze the news content crawled from these accounts by extracting sentiment features and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) features. We then input these features together with technical indicators into a novel hybrid model called RNN-boost to predict the stock volatility in the Chinese stock market.

The estimators are obtained directly from the noisy speech itself. The first estimator is obtained by binary classification of the received spectral amplitude into speech present or speech absent state. The second estimator is obtained by deriving the conditional probability of speech absence given the received spectral amplitude. Each of the time-adaptive estimators produces an estimate of the probability of speech absence for each spectral frequency. The estimated probability will be higher during the speech period and lower during the silence period. The estimated probability can be fed directly to any filter which requires such\u00a0\u2026", "Traditional MANET routing protocols are quite susceptible to link failure as well as vulnerable to malicious node attack. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called Position based Opportunistic Routing (POR) which takes full advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channel and opportunistic forwarding. The data packets are transmitted as a way of multicast (which is actually implemented by MAC interception) with multiple forwarders. A forwarder list determined by previous hop according to local position information is inserted into the IP header and the candidates take turn to forward the packet based on a predefined orders. This redundancy and randomness make it quite efficient and robust. In addition, inherited from position based routing, POR's control overhead is almost negligible which justifies its good scalability. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that POR not only achieves\u00a0\u2026", "Most 3D shape completion approaches rely heavily on partial-complete shape pairs and learn in a fully supervised manner. Despite their impressive performances on in-domain data, when generalizing to partial shapes in other forms or real-world partial scans, they often obtain unsatisfactory results due to domain gaps. In contrast to previous fully supervised approaches, in this paper we present ShapeInversion, which introduces Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion to shape completion for the first time. ShapeInversion uses a GAN pre-trained on complete shapes by searching for a latent code that gives a complete shape that best reconstructs the given partial input. In this way, ShapeInversion no longer needs paired training data, and is capable of incorporating the rich prior captured in a well-trained generative model. On the ShapeNet benchmark, the proposed ShapeInversion outperforms the SOTA unsupervised method, and is comparable with supervised methods that are learned using paired data. It also demonstrates remarkable generalization ability, giving robust results for real-world scans and partial inputs of various forms and incompleteness levels. Importantly, ShapeInversion naturally enables a series of additional abilities thanks to the involvement of a pre-trained GAN, such as producing multiple valid complete shapes for an ambiguous partial input, as well as shape manipulation and interpolation.", "Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) is developed to cope with intermittent connectivity and long delay in wireless networks. Due to the limited connectivity, DTN is vulnerable to blackhole and greyhole attacks in which malicious nodes intentionally drop all or part of the received messages. Although existing proposals could accurately detect the attack launched by individuals, they fail to tackle the case that malicious nodes cooperate with each other to cheat the defense system. In this paper, we suggest a scheme called Statistical-based Detection of Blackhole and Greyhole attackers (SDBG) to address both individual and collusion attacks. Nodes are required to exchange their encounter record histories, based on which other nodes can evaluate their forwarding behaviors. To detect the individual misbehavior, we define forwarding ratio metrics that can distinguish the behavious of attackers from normal nodes.

In this paper, we introduce Cooperative Content Distribution System for Vehicles (CCDSV) which operates upon a network of infrastructure APs to collaboratively distribute contents to moving vehicles. CCDSV solves several important issues in a practical system, like the robustness to mobility prediction errors, limited resources of APs and the shared content distribution. Our system organizes the cooperative APs into a novel structure, namely, the contact map which is based on the vehicular contact patterns observed by APs. To fully utilize the wireless bandwidth provided by APs, we propose a representative-based prefetching mechanism, in which a set of representative APs are carefully selected and then\u00a0\u2026", "It is well known that speech enhancement using spectral filtering will result in residual noise. Residual noise which is musical in nature is very annoying to human listeners. Many speech enhancement approaches assume that the transform coefficients are independent of one another and can thus be attenuated separately, thereby ignoring the correlations that exist between different time frames and within each frame. This paper, proposes a single channel speech enhancement system which exploits such correlations between the different time frames to further reduce residual noise. Unlike other 2D speech enhancement techniques which apply a post-processor after some classical algorithms such as spectral subtraction, the proposed approach uses a hybrid Wiener spectrogram filter (HWSF) for effective noise reduction, followed by a multi-blade post-processor which exploits the 2D features of the spectrogram to\u00a0\u2026", "By allowing vehicles to communicate on the roads, vehicular network is becoming a potential solution to improve the traffic safety.

They are difficult to detect while severely degrading the Quality of Service (QoS) of TCP applications. By combining Power Spectrum Analysis with Information Entropy, we introduce two novel information metrics to detect the LDoS attacks: Fourier Power Spectrum Entropy (FPSE) and Wavelet Power Spectrum Entropy (WPSE). As the energy of LDoS attack signal is mostly concentrated in the low-frequency range, FPSE and WPSE of LDoS attacks both exhibit lower values compared to those of normal flows. Therefore, these two metrics can be applied here to detect LDoS attacks efficiently. By evaluating on NS-3 simulations and real network traces, the results validate the effectiveness of these two metrics to differentiate LDoS attacks from normal flows. They can detect the LDoS attacks\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents the use of the wavelet transform for noise reduction in noisy speech signals.

Apart from that, we carefully select official accounts from Chinese largest online social networks - Sina Weibo and extract the content posted by these accounts to analyze the public moods. An influence feature is derived based on the public moods to further improve the prediction model. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline method and can achieve a good prediction performance.", "Rumors spread on Online Social Networks sometimes can lead to serious social issues. To accurately identify them from normal posts is proved to be of great value. Users' behaviors are different when they post rumors and normal posts. Since rumors only account for a small percentage of all posts, they can be regarded as anomalies. Therefore, we propose an anomaly detection method based on autoencoder to perform rumor detection. In this paper we propose several self-adapting thresholds which can facilitate rumor detection. In addition, we further discuss how the different number of hidden layers of autoencoder can influence the detection performance. The experimental results show that our model achieves a good F1 and a low false positive rate.", "Cognitive radio (CR) is proposed as an efficient way to address the issue of spectrum shortage and underutilization, in which cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is used to enhance sensing performance. One of the most fundamental problems of CSS is how to appropriately assign the secondary users (SUs) to sense the primary user (PU) channels. In this paper, we study the CSS problem under a more practical scenario where we take the heterogeneous characteristics of both SUs and PU channels into consideration. With the objective to maximize the achievable throughput for SUs, we propose a cluster-based CSS to obtain a proper assignment policy, in which all the SUs in the same cluster cooperate in sensing the same set of PU channels. Moreover, the cluster-based CSS problem is formulated as a Maximum-Weight one-sided Biclique (MWB) problem.

Using simulation results for randomized beamforming as a guideline, we identify crucial design issues for algorithm design. Our results show that, while significant path length reduction is achievable, this is accompanied by the problem of asymmetric paths between nodes. Subsequently, we propose a distributed algorithm for small-world creation that achieves path length reduction while maintaining connectivity. We define a new centrality measure that estimates the structural importance of nodes based on traffic flow in the network, which is used to identify the set of nodes that beamform. We show using simulations that this leads to a significant reduction in path length while maintaining\u00a0\u2026", "Discrete cosine transform (DCT) has been proven to be a good approximation to the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) and has similar properties to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).

Therefore a DCT-based speech enhancement system with pitch synchronous analysis is proposed to overcome this problem. It reduces the drawbacks of fixed window shift and the amount of shift in the analysis window is now based on the pitch period, thus increasing the inter-frame similarities. Furthermore, a Wiener filter using the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with an adaptive parameter is also derived and implemented as an advanced noise reduction filter.

Simulation results show that the algorithm performance closely tracks the theoretical analysis and only requires a fraction of the neighbors to be involved in the discovery process.", "A self-configurable and self-improving application-level framework is proposed for the streaming of video data across heterogeneous networks. The framework comprises a dynamic tree of clients which also act as relays to distribute video downstream and monitor network conditions, a lightweight server to manage the tree and a gossip-spiral mechanism to improve the tree robustness. The framework is loosely coupled such that failure of the lightweight server will not impact the data distribution functionality of the tree. The motivation of such an application-level approach which does not require router intervention, stems from the fact that IP-multicast is not enabled prevalently in most parts of the Internet. Streaming applications thus have to depend on a network of servers, relays and static tunnels instead of the more efficient multicast for data distribution across the Internet.

However, through the investigation of various flooding techniques, we propose to capitalize this very probabilistic feature to confine and mitigate flooding attacks through a queuing mechanism based on this probabilistic feature. To demonstrate our concept, we formulated a solution for Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity (PRoPHET), which is a routing protocol in DTN.

Therefore, the proposed ADAE is able to determine the outliers efficiently. In order to reduce the many parameters in ADAE, we introduce the Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) constraint into the learning objective of ADAE.

To define low-quality content comprehensibly, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is first used to coarsely classify low-quality tweets into four categories. Based on this preliminary study, a survey is carefully designed to gather users\u2019 opinions on different categories of low-quality content. Both direct and indirect features including newly proposed features are identified to characterize all types of low-quality content.

The results of our research show that our method has a high accuracy of 0.9711 and a good F1 of 0.8379 based on a random forest classifier with real time performance in the detection of low-quality content in tweets. Our work therefore achieves a positive impact in improving user experience in browsing social media content.", "Delay-tolerant network (DTN) is developed to cope with intermittent connectivity and long delay in wireless networks.

Existing works mitigate internal flooding attacks by rate limit to constrain the number of messages that nodes can generate per time slot. However, rate limit cannot flexibly accommodate burst traffic in which nodes may have sending demands higher than the rate limit for a short period. In this paper, we propose flooding detection based on encounter records (FDER) to detect flooding attack and yet allow legitimate burst traffic simultaneously. Nodes exchange their histories of encounter records (ER), which record the sent messages during their previous encounters. The ER history is used to infer a node's new message transmission rate\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we propose a network anomaly detection system which consists of a Maximal Information Coefficient based feature selection algorithm and a feature-based MSPCA detection algorithm, which can separate the anomalous information more efficiently.

It also does not increase the size of the IP header and does not require redirection of packets. These benefits are enabled with a tradeoff, which requires modifications on MN and its correspondent node. It uses an innovative IP-to-IP address mapping method to provide IP address transparency for applications and taps on the pervasiveness of SIP as a location service.

However, such a strategy will probably fail to detect many contacts with relatively short durations, leading to system performance degradation. In this paper, we consider a specific type of DTN, i.e., the pocket switched networks (PSN), in which the nodes' mobility pattern shows a strong social property. In a PSN, although the end-to-end path may be disconnected for the majority of time, several nodes periodically gather at certain hot spots and form well-connected clusters. Based on such mobility pattern, cooperation among nodes is utilized in our contact discovery design\u00a0\u2026", "Unexpected disconnections, long transmission latencies and network heterogeneity that DTN is meant to support make the routing problem in DTN very complicated. In DTN, probabilistic based routing protocols make use of nodes' mobility history to gauge delivery likelihood of nodes. However, the delivery likelihood of the nodes is not the only factor that affects the message delivery likelihood. In this paper, a detailed analysis of routing in DTN reveals the forwarding decisions that could go wrong due to the store-and-forward nature of DTN. Based on the analysis, we propose a history of messages concept which Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity (PRoPHET) can utilize to improve the chances of message delivery. Our simulations show that using the messages' history improves the message delivery performance of PRoPHET and is comparable to MaxProp.", "Recent studies in multi-agent communicative reinforcement learning (MACRL) have demonstrated that multi-agent coordination can be greatly improved by allowing communication between agents. Meanwhile, adversarial machine learning (ML) has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attacks. Despite the increasing concern about the robustness of ML algorithms, how to achieve robust communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning has been largely neglected. In this paper, we systematically explore the problem of adversarial communication in MACRL. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we propose an effective method to perform attacks in MACRL, by learning a model to generate optimal malicious messages. Second, we develop a defence method based on message reconstruction, to maintain multi-agent coordination under message attacks. Third, we formulate the adversarial communication problem as a two-player zero-sum game and propose a game-theoretical method R-MACRL to improve the worst-case defending performance. Empirical results demonstrate that many state-of-the-art MACRL methods are vulnerable to message attacks, and our method can significantly improve their robustness.", "The limitation of existing wireless wide area networks, coupled with the delay tolerant property of many non-realtime applications (e.g. email, file download) enables drive-thru networking, which depends on roadside units (RSUs) to provide vehicular users with intermittent Internet access service.

Based on the macro-level opportunistic scheduling and node cooperation, the best wireless link(s) (with the highest data rate) between the RSU and vehicular users can always be utilized. On the other hand, the advantage of opportunistic overhearing due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium is also exploited to reduce packet retransmission times, so as to further increase the effective\u00a0\u2026", "Despite the quality improvement of the speech signal with most traditional noise reduction (TNR) algorithms, the output is always distorted to some extent due to the over-attenuation of speech components. Weak speech components are usually regarded as noise in noise reduction processing and are therefore highly suppressed. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing technique which is based on the regeneration of both the voiced and unvoiced speech in the entire frequency domain to reduce this problem. A nonlinear transform is first applied to obtain the excitation signal, and a smooth envelope is then estimated. To utilize the information of the clean speech contained in the envelope, we combine the original TNR filter output with a weighted product of the excitation signal and the estimated envelope to generate the final synthesized speech.

In this paper, we propose a trading model to investigate both the computation and communication resources allocation in MEC systems with multi-server and multi-user. We model the dynamic behavior of mobile users (MUs) using an evolutionary game, and then we build the deterministic and stochastic models to study the evolution of MUs where the evolutionary equilibrium is considered as the solution.

Data is encoded into Red-, Blue- and Green-color QR codes and are multiplexed to form multiple multi-color QR codes that will be flashed on the screen of the sender's device. The receiver, in the form of a camera of a mobile device, will record the flashing images and convert the images into RGB channels using grayscale conversion. Thus one image will be split into 3 sets of black and white QR codes. Results show that ColorQR is highly feasible and it can transmit data of varying sizes without limitation.", "MAC protocols to sense channels for data transmission have been widely investigated for the secondary users to efficiently utilize and share the spectrum licensed by the primary user. One important issue associated with MAC protocols design is how the secondary users determine when and which channel they should sense and access without causing harmful interference to the primary user. In this paper, we jointly consider the MAC-layer spectrum sensing and channel access. Normal Spectrum Sensing (NSS) is required to be carried out at the beginning of each frame to determine whether the channel is idle. On detecting the available transmission opportunity, the secondary users employ CSMA for channel contention. The novelty is that, Fast Spectrum Sensing (FSS) is inserted after channel contention to promptly detect the return of the primary users.

The main reason for the lack of bandwidth or the exponential reduction in the bandwidth is the contention for bandwidth between nodes along the path. In this paper we will demonstrate one way to overcome this problem through the use of multiple channels multiple interfaces (MCMI). We investigate different forwarding channel selection schemes for MCMI communication with Destination Sequenced Distance Vector protocol: same channel, random and round robin. Based on our analysis and simulation results we have shown that MCMI protocol significantly improves the channel capacity while maintaining low end-to-end delay. Forwarding channel selection policies play an important role in determining the performance of the MCMI.

Therefore, rumour detection, especially early rumour detection (ERD), is very challenging given the limited, incomplete and noisy information. Although there are some researches on earlier rumour detection, most of their studies require a larger dataset or a longer detection time span, i.e., the rumour detection efficiency needs to be improved. In this paper, we focus on a shorter detection time span which also means fewer online posts to achieve the task of ERD. We proposed a novel post-based augmentation representation approach to process post content of rumour events in the early stages of their dissemination, i.e., backward compression mapping mechanism (BCMM). In addition, we combine BCMM with gated recurrent unit (GRU) to represent post content, topology network of posts and metadata\u00a0\u2026", "In the information age, a secure and stable network environment is essential and hence intrusion detection is critical for any networks. In this paper, we propose a self-organizing map assisted deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (SOM-DAGMM) supplemented with well-preserved input space topology for more accurate network intrusion detection. The deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model comprises a compression network and an estimation network which is able to perform unsupervised joint training. However, the code generated by the autoencoder is inept at preserving the topology of the input space, which is rooted in the bottleneck of the adopted deep structure.

We first introduce the concepts of available, request and delivered locality in intra-video user access patterns and prove that high available locality exists in different videos by both simulation and theoretical analysis. Moreover, with a relaxed definition of data chunk holder, intra-video locality can facilitate a high likelihood of a peer seeking within a video, finding a holder of the requested data among its neighbors.

This mobility scheme supports both horizontal and vertical handover and no triangular routing is involved. Depending on the QoS requirement, each data flow can either be allocated to one of the links or distributed across multiple links.

This problem is NP-complete, and a recent result in theoretical computer science called randomized rounding algorithm with polynomial computational complexity is developed to find the \u03c1-approximation solution.

High rate stations can help relay packets from low-rate stations resulting in better throughput for the entire network. However, this also involves additional energy costs on the part of the relay which can result in reducing the network lifetime. We propose a cooperative MAC protocol NetCoop with the objective of maximizing the network lifetime and achieving high throughput. Based on this design, we also propose a flexible strategy which allows cooperation to be achieved using more than one relay. We show that this can achieve at least as good throughput as that of single relay cooperation while maintaining a high network lifetime.", "A hybrid protocol for application level multicast (HPAM) for live video streaming without native IP multicast support is proposed. HPAM exploits the simplicity and optimality of a lightweight, centralized server with the robustness and scaleability of distributed clients. HPAM self-organizes clients on the fly to form efficient source-based overlay trees while the server facilitates peer discovery and also serves as a reliable backup should the distributed algorithms fails. Tree construction, refinement and recovery from partitions are carried out independently by the clients. Simulation results show that HPAM can build and maintain reasonably latency-efficient overlay trees with a lower overhead than a fully centralized system (host based multicast) and yet more responsive to group dynamics and network environment than a fully distributed system (host multicast).", "A new metric, processing delay, has been proposed for route path selection. Processing delay, proposed by G. Bianchi, (2000) is used to calculate the performance of each node along the route. The function takes into account the number of active nodes in the vicinity of the forwarding node. Simulation experiments which have incorporated the new metric into the on-demand mobile ad hoc network protocol, dynamic source routing (DSR), have shown that the new metric has the characteristics of spreading the routes among the nodes in the network, thus minimizing congestion. The performance of the new on-demand ad hoc network, enhanced-DSR (eDSR), has shown a 20% reduction in packet delay, with marginal increase in hop counts", "This paper introduces JMS (Java-based Meeting Space), an object-oriented framework for developing synchronous collaborative applications over the Internet.

Thus the detection of rumors on OSN has become a hot research topic in recent years. While most of the previous work proposed some supervised methods like classification to deal with the rumor detection problem, we view the rumors as outliers among the recent Weibos posted by a user and propose a novel outlier detection method to detect them. An improved PCA method is proposed to deal with both the categorical and numerical features used for detection and to preserve the most significant information that we are interested in. Then a distance-based outlier detection method is applied to detect the potential rumors. Experimental results show that our method can achieve a better F1 and time performance compared to previous work.", "Cybercriminals ramp up their efforts with sophisticated techniques while defenders gradually update their typical security measures. Attackers often have a long-term interest in their targets. Due to a number of factors such as scale, architecture and nonproductive traffic however it makes difficult to detect them using typical intrusion detection techniques. Cyber early warning systems (CEWS) aim at alerting such attempts in their nascent stages using preliminary indicators. Design and implementation of such systems involves numerous research challenges such as generic set of indicators, intelligence gathering, uncertainty reasoning and information fusion. This paper discusses such challenges and presents the reader with compelling motivation. A carefully deployed empirical analysis using a real world attack scenario and a real network traffic capture is also presented.", "Among all the existing objective measures, few are able to provide a clearly specific indication of speech distortion or noise reduction, which are the two key metrics to assess the performance of speech enhancement algorithms and evaluate the noise-suppressed speech quality. In this paper, new quantitative quality assessments are proposed to separately evaluate the capabilities of single channel speech enhancement algorithms in terms of maintaining the clean speech, noise reduction and overall performance. Based on these aspects, three evaluation results can be provided for any one test speech signal by analyzing the residual signal which is the difference between the clean speech and the processed speech. Several common speech enhancement algorithms are compared by these objective measures as well as subjective listening tests.

Mobile Internet access through roadside APs has emerged as an alternative to cellular networks due to its high bandwidth and low cost. However, due to the sparse deployment of roadside APs, connectivity disruption might take place when vehicles travel between APs. In addition, the IP address will also change as the vehicle changes its attachment to the network. This creates problems to existing IP applications as they are not designed to handle connectivity disruption and change of address. Furthermore, as a vehicle travels at high speed, its contact with a roadside AP will be brief. It is necessary to effectively utilize such brief contacts.

However, existing group mobility metrics cannot assess quantitatively whether a mobility model can provide the necessary degree of group mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, Degree of Node Reachability (DNR), to measure the degree of group mobility from the perspective of network topology. Based on DNR, we propose r-test to quantitatively assess whether a given mobility model will fail to satisfy the required network condition. The proposed metric is validated using common mobility models. The simulation results show that our metric can capture the network topology changes and reflect the impact of underlying node mobility.

It is observed that as the mobility of nodes increases, the performance of existing cluster based routing protocols tends to deteriorate rapidly. Although many mobility based clustering schemes have been proposed to address this problem, majority of these proposals assume the movement of nodes follows group mobility. In this paper, we propose a new cluster based routing protocol FASTR which utilizes mobile backbone to mitigate the impact of node mobility for networks with high node mobility and low group mobility. Our scheme eliminates the delay caused by cluster head election and enables nodes to start communication immediately after joining a cluster. Through simulation and analysis, our protocol is shown to possess good scalability, incur lower control overhead and achieve higher packet delivery ratio\u00a0\u2026", "In places where mobile users can access multiple wireless networks simultaneously, a multipath scheduling algorithm can benefit the performance of wireless networks and improve the experience of mobile users. However, existing literature shows that it may not be the case, especially for TCP flows. According to early investigations, there are mainly two reasons that result in bad performance of TCP flows in wireless networks. One is the occurrence of out-of-order packets due to different delays in multiple paths. The other is the packet loss which is resulted from the limited bandwidth of wireless networks. To better exploit multipath scheduling for TCP flows, this paper presents a new scheduling algorithm named Adaptive Load Balancing Algorithm (ALBAM) to split traffic across multiple wireless links within the ISP infrastructure.

It provides fairness in terms of throughput and differentiation in average and worst-case queuing time among queues that require different rate and delay guarantees. Simulation shows that it achieves near-perfect throughput fairness that is comparable to DRR scheduler and delay differentiation that is comparable to Earliest Departure First scheduler.", "Recovering a textured 3D mesh from a monocular image is highly challenging, particularly for in-the-wild objects that lack 3D ground truths. In this work, we present MeshInversion, a novel framework to improve the reconstruction by exploiting the generative prior of a 3D GAN pre-trained for 3D textured mesh synthesis. Reconstruction is achieved by searching for a latent space in the 3D GAN that best resembles the target mesh in accordance with the single view observation. Since the pre-trained GAN encapsulates rich 3D semantics in terms of mesh geometry and texture, searching within the GAN manifold thus naturally regularizes the realness and fidelity of the reconstruction. Importantly, such regularization is directly applied in the 3D space, providing crucial guidance of mesh parts that are unobserved in the 2D space.

Vehicular users requesting for data download service with variable file sizes regularly arrive at and depart from the limited coverage range of roadside access point. If the corresponding data queue at the access point cannot be serviced in a certain time period, it has to be cleared, resulting in degraded QoS. To minimize the number of uncompleted file download jobs in the face of multiple-user contention, a Dynamic Predictive Scheduling (DPS) algorithm is proposed. Based on the prediction of the remaining bandwidth of the different users, a scheduling tree is constructed to facilitate the selection of the data queue to serve at particular time slots.

Our scheduling algorithm distributedly prioritizes the data packets and sends the most important data to the whole system first. It avoids wasting network resources while frequently switching peer connections. The algorithm serves to provide an optimal ordering solution to minimize overall latency based on overlay structure information.

Its popularity can be attested by its use in all the sectors of the industry.

One class of portable barcode scanners utilises wireless transmission technology, usually radio frequency, which faces problems of limited coverage and radio interferences. These devices often have a prohibitive price tag, as they comprise a handheld unit and a base station. Another type of portable scanners has built-in memory units to store the data collected.

In order to explore the diversity of both RNs and RSs, we propose a sequential relay-remote selection and offloading strategy by taking the local computing, relay computing and remote computing into consideration. The sequential relay-remote selection strategy specifies when to stop server discovery and carry out computation offloading. The offloading strategy tells what are the optimal portions of task executed locally, at RN and at RS. Under such framework, we seek to minimize the total energy consumption coming from server detection, data transmission and data execution.

The replication system for vehicular users is quite different from the traditional system for static Web users. The transient connection period between the vehicle and the AP makes it difficult for the vehicle to download the entire file requested and thus the content retrieval is usually across several APs. Such characteristic poses two problems: (1) replication in units of entire file may be inefficient in terms of resource utilization; (2) the actual contribution of an individual AP can be affected by the other correlated APs during the content retrieval. To deal with these challenges, we formulate the vehicular content retrieval into an offline optimization model that helps establish the performance bounds of\u00a0\u2026", "This paper describes the implementation of an inexpensive `do-it-yourself (DIY)' smart home system which allows for an unobtrusive and non-invasive monitoring system of the elderly's well-being in their own home using motion sensors.

In a PSN, although the end-to-end connection may be disconnected most of the time for a given source-destination pair, several nodes periodically gather at certain hot spots and form well connected clusters. Based on such mobility pattern, cooperation among nodes is utilized in our contact discovery design. The nodes that have already joined a cluster collaboratively wake up to discover new contacts.

Two strategies are proposed to efficiently select the representative neighbors: fixed branching and honeycomb strategies. The fixed branching strategy selects one representative neighbor in each predefined forwarding direction, while the honeycomb strategy selects representative neighbors to create a hexagonal tiling pattern.

However, unlike Wi-Fi bands, TV spectrum is subjected to high spatial and temporal variations due to the random arrivals and departures of primary users (PUs), which results in new technical challenges in TV spectrum utilization. One important issue is how to allocate TV spectrum to secondary users (SUs) by taking the spatial and temporal variations into consideration. This has been largely ignored in previous studies. In this paper, we first formulate the TV spectrum allocation problem as a 0\u20131 integer optimization problem, and then we approximate our optimal objective via Log-Sum-Exp function. Thereafter, we solve this problem by implementing a Markov chain in a distributed manner.

The integration of multiple network technologies results in different perspectives in bandwidth usage and delay requirements during handover when a multi-homed mobile host traverses the different access networks. Here, we focus on a multi-homed mobile node with seamless mobility and bandwidth aggregation over multiple links. The system lies on the network layer and supports end-to-end TCP multi-homing using SIP signaling protocol. It helps to reduce TCP handover delay and achieve aggregated bandwidth. We propose an In-Kernel Re-Order Packet scheme to reduce out-of-order packets for TCP. Experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve aggregated bandwidth, increase reliability and reduce handover delay.", "In this paper, we study the throughput and delay scaling laws over two coexisting mobile networks. The primary network consists of n randomly distributed primary nodes which can operate as if the secondary network is absent. However, the secondary network with a higher density m=n\u03b2, \u03b2>1 is required to adjust its protocol. By considering that both the primary and the secondary networks move according to random walk mobility model, we propose a multi-hop transmission scheme, and show that the secondary network can achieve the same throughput and delay tradeoff scaling law as in stand-alone network Ds(m)=\u0398(m\u03bbs(m)).

Most of them focus on how to organize the peer connections into an efficient overlay network. Due to the variation in the network, a lot of overhead is generated when the overlay structure adapts to the changes. In order to minimize the impact of network fluctuation, we proposed a scheduling algorithm which helps to distribute stream data efficiently through the fluctuating networks. It needs only partial information about overlay structure and provides the services to satisfy most number of users. The global latency experienced by peers in the system is thus minimized.

However, this typically results in a large number of unnecessary transmissions, which could be expensive for resource-constrained nodes such as those in a sensor network. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism HopAlert which optimizes route establishment and packet routing by limiting the number of nodes taking part in the route discovery process while achieving a low number of hops establishment. Using analysis and simulations, we show that this results in more routes with shorter hop counts than a reactive flooding protocol such as AODV while achieving higher savings.", "In this paper, we propose a framework to enhance user perceived quality in a multihomed terminal. Based on the observed media independent handover parameters from all the interfaces, the terminal is made aware of the performance of the different access networks and it can intelligently select the interface to send out the data packets. Several schemes, for the purpose of load balancing, are defined as policies to govern the terminal's outbound packet transmission over multiple network interfaces. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid load balancing scheme outperforms the round robin schemes in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, inter-packet delay variation and packet loss. The novel feature of this framework lies in the ability to intelligently exploit the multiple interfaces in data transmission to greatly enhance user's perceived quality from the use of media independent handover parameters.", "The IEEE 802.11e standard has introduced specifications for service differentiation among different classes of data by specifying four service classes and a new contention resolution mechanism called EDCA.

Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically, we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well, texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap.

In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically, we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well, texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap. Furthermore, we achieve efficient training without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy samples synthesized from off-the-shelf 2D toonification models.", "Until recently, state of the art (SOTA) deep learning methods for time series prediction problems, such as electricity load forecasting, have been based on recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), or combinations thereof. However, RNNs involve sequential computations that cannot be parallelized on machine learning accelerators, while CNNs require very deep networks to capture long distance relationships. This paper proposes a sparse transformer based method for time series prediction. The proposed model achieves comparable accuracy to the SOTA method, TSRNN, on the London Smart Meter dataset while achieving up to 10 times faster inference speed.", "Prior self-supervised video object segmentation models directly find pixel correspondences between pairs of frames. Instead, we propose a novel approach of employing superpixel features for learning visual correspondences between frames of a video sequence. With an attention mechanism, we train the model to reconstruct the next frame using superpixel features between adjacent frames of videos trained in a self-supervised manner. As superpixels are able to group pixels based on color and proximity, they reduce repetitive and noisy pixels that may confuse the model during tracking. In addition, the structural information provided by the superpixel features can help improve the segmentation of objects. We benchmark our method (S3CNet) against existing self-supervised pixel correspondence frameworks such as [12, 22, 24] and show that our self-supervised superpixel correspondence method performs\u00a0\u2026", "The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become one of the most important computing technologies. Disassembly shader codes, which are machine-level codes, are important for GPU designers (e.g., AMD, Intel, NVIDIA) to tune the hardware, including customization of clock speeds and voltages. Due to many use-cases of modern GPUs, engineers generally find it difficult to manually inspect a large number of shader codes emerging from these applications. To this end, we develop a framework that converts shader codes into graphs, and employs sophisticated graph mining and machine learning techniques over a number of applications to simplify shader graphs analysis in an effective and explainable manner, aiming at accelerating the whole debugging process and improving the overall hardware performance.

The current challenge is to render it efficient enough for wide deployment. In this paper, we propose a human action recognition model which does not require optical flow extraction and 3D convolution, called Context-Aware Memory Attention Network (CAMA-Net). It consists of an attention module called Context-Aware Memory Attention Module which is used to calculate the relevance score between the key and value pairs from the backbone output. The proposed method is evaluated and tested on popular public action recognition datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. The results demonstrate the strength of our proposed model as it outperforms existing baseline models.", "Recovering a textured 3D mesh from a single image is highly challenging, particularly for in-the-wild objects that lack 3D ground truths. Prior attempts resort to weak supervision based on 2D silhouette annotations of monocular images. Since the supervision lies in the 2D space while the output is in the 3D space, such in-direct supervision often over-emphasizes the observable part of the 3D textured mesh, at the expense of the overall reconstruction quality. Although previous attempts have adopted various hand-crafted heuristics to reduce this gap, this issue is far from being solved. In this work, we present an alternative framework, \\textbf{MeshInversion}, that reduces the gap by exploiting the \\textit{generative prior} of a 3D GAN pre-trained for 3D textured mesh synthesis. Reconstruction is achieved by searching for a latent space in the 3D GAN that best resembles the target mesh in accordance with the single view observation. Since the pre-trained GAN encapsulates rich 3D semantics in terms of mesh geometry and texture, searching within the GAN manifold thus naturally regularizes the realness and fidelity of the reconstruction. Importantly, such regularization is directly applied in the 3D space, providing crucial guidance of mesh parts that are unobserved in the 2D space. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our framework obtains faithful 3D reconstructions with consistent geometry and texture across both observed and unobserved parts. Moreover, it generalizes well to meshes that are less commonly seen, such as the extended articulation of deformable objects.", "Ageing causes loss of muscle strength, especially on the lower limbs, resulting in higher risk to injuries during functional activities. The path to recovery is through physiotherapy and adopt customized rehabilitation exercise to assist the patients. Hence, lowering the risk of incorrect exercise at home involves the use of biofeedback for physical rehabilitation patients and quantitative reports for clinical physiotherapy. This research topic has garnered much attention in recent years owing to the fast ageing population and the limited number of clinical experts. In this paper, the authors survey the existing works in exercise assessment and state identification. The evaluation results in the accuracy of 95.83% average classifying exercise motion state using the proposed raw signal. It confirmed that raw signals have more impact than using sensor-fused Euler and joint angles in the state identification prediction model.", "User mobility is an intrinsic trait of many MEC applications, which has posed significant challenges for realizing reliable computing. However, existing works studying this problem mainly focus on the movements of users while another high-dynamic behavior due to the randomness of computation tasks is largely ignored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we formulate the computation offloading problem in MEC system as a combinatorial optimization problem, and then we construct a Markov chain with steady-state distribution specifying to our problem in a distributed manner, such that the user mobility problem is transformed into the state transition problem. Moreover, this Markov chain is further extended to consider a dynamic scenario where the number of active users in the MEC system changes over time.

However, the computation and communication resources of edge servers are limited, so it is challenging to perform resource allocation especially when the competition among edge servers is also taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose a trading model to investigate both the computation and communication resources allocation in MEC systems with multi-server and multiuser. We model the dynamic behavior of mobile users (MUs) using an evolutionary game, and then we build the deterministic model to study the evolution of MUs where the evolutionary equilibrium is considered as the solution. We propose an evolution algorithm to obtain the evolutionary equilibrium. Furthermore, we analyze the competition among edge cloud servers (ECSs) by a noncooperative game, and propose an iteration\u00a0\u2026", "Aging causes loss of muscle strength, especially on the lower limbs, resulting in a higher risk of injuries during functional activities.

Since TV white spaces are open to all networks and all types of applications, it is likely that there will be multiple networks and application systems authorized to use the same TV channels at the same time. Currently, there is mechanism for different users to operate in the TV white spaces within one system, while TV spectrum sharing among heterogeneous networks and application systems is largely ignored. To address the problem, this paper designs a trading mechanism to study the TV spectrum market between Geolocation database and heterogeneous application systems.

This characteristic is often observed when the range of motion reaches or exceeds approximately 85 degrees. Elimination of oscillation in the filtered output signal is of significance as it means the filtered signal can be applied directly by applications such as visualization, motion tracking, clinical report, etc. This paper proposed a system model using feature selection and machine learning algorithm to automatically detect and post-filter the oscillation.

WAM is used daily and has high potential for home rehabilitation. However, it is limited by its high cost. The arrival of smartphones provides an alternative for motion tracking as they have a number of motion sensors. However, most smartphone applications only use them to detect general movement and not precise motion. A Complementary Feedback Filter (CFF) is proposed and developed to fuse readings from the smartphone's noisy motion sensors in order to get accurate orientation of body segments. The experimental results have shown that movement orientation accuracy obtained from applying CFF on smartphone sensors is comparable to XSENS Awinda, a commercial motion tracking system. The combination of the proposed CFF and the smartphone's motion sensors are then applied to RehabPartner, a\u00a0\u2026", "Anomaly detection is an important issue which has been studied in diverse application domains. In computer networks, the anomalies could indicate possible attacks to the target server. Thus, it is necessary to establish fast detection of network anomalies in the server for the purpose of intrusion detection in the server side. In addition, in the bottleneck router, it is also necessary to detect and mitigate the Low-rate Denial of Service attacks. In the field of computer vision, anomaly detection is often referred to as outlier detection, which is also very important, especially for the deep learning techniques. Nowadays, deep learning has become a mainstream approach in many research pertaining to computer vision. Deep learning technique requires large datasets. Thus, outlier detection techniques are often applied here to clean the datasets.

First, the author proposes Multi-scale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA) algorithm to detect network anomalies. By combining PCA with wavelet analysis, MSPCA algorithm is supposed to address the normal subspace contamination problem so as to increase the detection accuracy. In addition, the author introduces MMECE threshold and Bayesian-PCA to the conventional-MSPCA algorithm. Thus, this improved-MSPCA algorithm has lower time complexity and fewer parameters to set.

We propose an efficient and distributed replication algorithm explicitly taking into account the content popularity, vehicle-AP contact pattern, and content availability among correlated APs. Simulation based on real vehicular trace proves the effectiveness of the proposed replication system. The performance in terms of download rate and completion ratio has at least 15% to 20% improvement against the algorithms under comparison.", "Cybercriminals ramp up their efforts with sophisticated techniques while defenders gradually update their typical security measures.

Such flaws render the schemes impractical for use in real-life where it can be safely assumed that they will be used non-atomically. Techniques to address the flaws are also discussed and a solution based on cryptography presented.", "Existing literatures show that deploying fixed relay infrastructure with stable interconnections can help to improve network connectivity. However, fixed relay infrastructure is inflexible and could be costly to deploy over large area.

Through extensive simulation, it is observed that mobile relays help to effectively improve the network connectivity, prolong the mean contact duration and reduce the number of network partitions. The mobile relay approach is also compared with the alternative approach of increasing node density. Through the simulation results, it is observed that mobile relay approach is far more effective than the alternative approach.

In our paper, secondary users cooperatively sense the channel and send the binary results to the common receiver where energy detection with hard decision rule is employed.

In this paper, a new criterion to evaluate robustness is proposed. The criterion is derived from examining the weakest link of stream sources serving a peer. The quality of connection is defined as how complementary the connection is to the other existing connections in order to improve the completeness of the downloading stream as well as the backup copies. Peers can thus find better connection combination and experience the best stream quality and backup robustness from the existing connections. The collective maximization of robustness among peers rather than maximization of a peer's own resource alleviates the contention for resources, and helps the peers to reasonably allocate and utilize the limited network resources.

HPAM-L acts as a control experiment in the evaluation. Another novel feature introduced in HPAM-D is the detection of likely local congestion via a heuristic based on the computation of a client's relative loss rate with respect to the data received by its parent as opposed to the commonly used absolute loss rate experienced by a client.

Effective utilization of the multiple available channels helps to reduce the channel interference so that multiple simultaneous data transmissions can occur and thus increasing network capacity. Initial approach for exploiting multiple available channels is dedicating one interface for each channel. However, this approach incurs high hardware cost and is not practical. This paper presents a distributed channel assignment and routing protocol that can take advantage of multiple available channels with two interfaces by dynamically switching the channels for forwarding packets based on data traffic. Our model can work with any existing routing protocol, we extend the AODV routing protocol with suitable modification and an additional routing metric to present the proposed AODV-M algorithm.

The main reason for the lack of bandwidth is channel interference, which is caused by contention for the shared channel between wireless nodes. The natural approach to overcome this problem is exploiting the availability of multiple channels multiple interfaces (MCMI) networks. However, it is costly and may not be practical to dedicate one interface per channel for every node. Thus in this paper, we study the MCMI network, where the number of interfaces that every node has is less than the number of available channels.

To make Internet faxing successful, it is necessary to provide sufficient global coverage. However, this is difficult to achieve as magnitudes of servers and fax modem pools have to be deployed, together with technical personnel for support and maintenance. These will increase costs that will eventually have to be passed on to the user. This paper proposes a distributed fax transportation mechanism that utilizes existing Internet faxing services as secondary resources to provide coverage for fax communication. The transportation mechanism has been implemented in the FaxPortal system, which supports different modes of Internet fax services including Mail-to-Fax through an electronic mail client, Web\u00a0\u2026", "Most existing Internet faxing systems, which use Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol as the underlying transportation layer for fax delivery, are unable to support real-time fax delivery as traditional faxing. In this paper, an Internet real-time faxing system that supports real-time transmission of fax messages is described. The system is known as RTFaxing which consists of two gateways: Fax-In Gateway (FIG) and Fax-Out Gateway (FOG). FIG is responsible for the reception, processing, compression and transmission of fax-image data to FOG through the Internet. FOG then decompresses and reconstructs the fax-images for dispatching to the destination fax machines. Buffering mechanism, and adaptive control and recovery mechanism have been incorporated into the RTFaxing system to minimise the impact of delay jitters and packet loss.", "Describes the architecture for a World Wide Web-based distributed virtual reality system (DVRS) based on the high-level architecture \"RunTime Infrastructure\", which was developed for distributed interactive simulation.

The design revolves around the Verb Usage Frame (VUF) and the Noun Classification Hierarchy (NCH). VUF contains different context items which embody the different semantic usages of a verb under different contexts. The meaning of the verb is resolved through the classifications of its subject and object, achieved through the NCH. NCH returns not just the basic classification of a noun but also its super-classification. This allows thorough semantic analysis of both the verb and the noun.

The current challenge is to render it efficient enough for wide deployment. In this paper, we propose a human action recognition model which does not require optical flow extraction and 3D convolution, called Context-Aware Memory Attention Network (CAMA-Net). It consists of an attention module called Context-Aware Memory Attention Module which is used to calculate the relevance score between the key and value pairs from the backbone output. The proposed method is evaluated and tested on four popular public action recognition datasets, UCF101, HMDB51, ActivityNet and Diving48.

We follow the same architectures for the generator and the UV space discriminator as described in ConvMesh [6] for pre-training. ConvMesh baseline uses a convolutional generator G with two branches, to generate deformation map S\u2208 R32\u00d7 32 and texture map T\u2208 R512\u00d7 512 in the UV space respectively from a latent code z\u2208 R64. The UV space discriminator consists of two sub-discriminators, for discriminating the deformation map and texture map respectively. In addition, we introduce an image space discriminator to further enforce the realism of the synthesized texture and shape, following the architecture of PatchGAN [3]. We render the synthesized textured mesh to images with the DIB-R differentiable renderer [1] following the Kaolin [4] implementation. Preparation of Pseudo Ground Truths. During pre-training, discrimination in the UV space requires pseudo ground truth deformation maps and texture maps of the training images. The pseudo deformation maps are obtained by training a mesh reconstruction baseline on the training set. It outputs a 3D object as a deformation map and a texture map as well. Subsequently, the associated pseudo texture maps are obtained through a form of inverse rendering, ie, projecting the foreground pixels from the natural images onto the UV space. Since only the visible regions can be projected to the UV space, all the resulting pseudo texture maps are in fact partial. During training, the generated texture maps are masked to form partial texture maps as well prior to discrimination. More details of pseudo ground truths preparation can be found in [6]. Note that the mesh reconstruction\u00a0\u2026", "This paper details the design and development of a web-based publishing and retrieval system for traffic court cases.
