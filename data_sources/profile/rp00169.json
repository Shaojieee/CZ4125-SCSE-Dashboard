hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been limited by small samples or measurement of single brain regions. Since the neuropsychological deficits in ADHD implicate a network linking basal ganglia and frontal regions, 12 subcortical and cortical regions and their symmetries were measured to determine if these structures best distinguished ADHD.MethodAnatomic brain MRIs for 57 boys with ADHD and 55 healthy matched controls, aged 5 to 18 years, were obtained using a 1.5-T scanner with contiguous 2-mm sections.

Characterization of the normal developmental pattern of the CC is hindered by enormous variability of its size. This is especially problematic for cross-sectional studies seeking to assess possible nonlinear developmental curves.3.3.

The method improved identification of cancer tissues from benign tissues on several benchmark datasets, as it takes into account the redundancy among the genes during their selection. The method selected a less number of genes compared to MRMR or SVM-RFE on most datasets.

The medial temporal lobes have been proposed as possible locations for such a lesion. The authors tested this hypothesis in a group of children and adolescents with childhood-onset schizophrenia who had severe, chronic symptoms and who were refractory to treatment with typical neuroleptics.MethodAnatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired with a 1.5-T scanner for 21 patients (mean age= 14.6 years, SD= 2.1) who had onset of schizophrenia by age 12 (mean age at onset= 10.2, SD= 1.5) and 41 normal children. Volumes of the temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus were measured by manually outlining these structures on contiguous 2-mm thick coronal slices.ResultsPatients with childhood-onset schizophrenia had significantly smaller cerebral volumes. With no adjustment for brain volume, no diagnostic differences were observed for any temporal lobe structure. Unexpectedly, with adjustment for total cerebral volume, larger volumes of the superior temporal gyrus and its posterior segment and a trend toward larger temporal lobe volume emerged for the patients with schizophrenia. These patients lacked the normal (right-greater-than-left) hippocampal asymmetry.ConclusionsThese findings do not indicate a more severe medial temporal lobe lesion as the basis of very early onset schizophrenia.", "A technique for quantifying the midsagittal size and shape of the corpus callosum (CC) from magnetic resonance brain scans is presented.

Factors that control transition from mild forms of disease such as dengue fever (DF) to more life-threatening forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are poorly understood. Consequently, there are no reliable methods currently available for early triage of DHF patients resulting in significant over-hospitalization. Methodology/Principal Findings We have systematically examined the proteome, cytokines and inflammatory markers in sera from 62 adult dengue patients (44 DF; 18 DHF) with primary DENV infection, at three different times of infection representing the early febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages. Using fluorescent bioplex assays, we measured 27 cytokines in these serum samples. Additionally, we used multiple mass spectrometry methods for iTRAQ-based comparative analysis of serum proteome as well as measurements of protein adducts- 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine as surrogate measures of free radical activity. Using multiple methods such as OPLS, MRMR and MSVM-RFE for multivariate feature selection and classification, we report molecular markers that allow prediction of primary DHF with sensitivity and specificity of >80%.

Intuitively, color seems to play an important role in recognizing people in scenes. Recent research has evinced that color cues contribute in recognizing faces, especially when shape cues of the images are degraded. Although the input to many of the face recognition systems is color images, during preprocessing, these images are converted to gray scale images for the feature extraction. In this study, we use non negative matrix factorization (NMF) to recognize color face images. By using NMF, we encode color channels (red, green, blue), thereby, projecting these feature vectors to sparse subspaces. The implemented system is tested on a subset of color images in the AR database for robustness against facial expressions and illumination variations.

Though multi-class classification is typically solved by combining several binary classifiers, recently, several multi-class methods that consider all classes at once have been proposed. However, these methods require resolving a much larger optimization problem and are applicable to small datasets. Three methods based on binary classifications: one-against-all (OAA), one-against-one (OAO), and directed acyclic graph (DAG), and two approaches for multi-class problem by solving one single optimization problem, are implemented to predict protein secondary structure. Our experiments indicate that multi-class SVM methods are more suitable for protein secondary structure (PSS) prediction than the other methods, including binary SVMs, because their capacity to solve an optimization problem in one step. Furthermore, in this paper, we argue that it is feasible to extend the prediction accuracy by adding a second-stage multi-class SVM to capture the contextual information among secondary structural elements and thereby further improving the accuracies. We demonstrate that two-stage SVMs perform better than single-stage SVM techniques for PSS prediction using two datasets and report a maximum accuracy of 79.5%.", "We develop a standardized, fully automated, quantification system for liver fibrosis assessment using second harmonic generation microscopy and a morphology-based quantification algorithm. Liver fibrosis is associated with an abnormal increase in collagen as a result of chronic liver diseases.

The approach is exploratory in the sense that it does not require an a priori model as in the earlier approaches, such as the Structural Equation Modeling or Dynamic Causal Modeling, which can only affirm or refute the connectivity of a previously known anatomical model or a hypothesized model. The conditional probabilities that render the interactions among brain regions in Bayesian networks represent the connectivity in the complete statistical sense. The present method is applicable even when the number of regions involved in the cognitive network is large or unknown. We demonstrate the present approach by using synthetic data and fMRI data collected in silent word reading and counting Stroop tasks.", "We propose a novel method to automatically segment subcortical structures of human brain in magnetic resonance images by using fuzzy templates. A set of fuzzy templates of the structures based on features such as intensity, spatial location, and relative spatial relationship among structures are first created from a set of training images by defining the fuzzy membership functions and by fusing the information of features. Segmentation is performed by registering the fuzzy templates of the structures on the test image and then by fusing them with the tissue maps of the test image. The final decision is taken in order to optimize the certainty in the intensity, location, relative position, and tissue content of the structure.

(1998)], a Markov random field (MRF) is used to represent configurations of activated brain voxels, and likelihoods given by statistical parametric maps (SPM's) are directly used to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of segmentation. The iterative segmentation algorithm, which is based on a simulated annealing scheme, is fully data-driven and capable of analyzing experiments involving multiple-input stimuli. Simulation results and comparisons with the simple thresholding and the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) approaches are presented with synthetic images, and functional MR images acquired in memory retrieval and event-related working memory tasks.

The DNA sequence is first converted to a 59-dimensional feature vector where each element corresponds to the relative synonymous usage frequency of a codon. As the input to the classifier is independent of sequence length and variance, our approach is useful when the sequences to be classified are of different lengths, a condition that homology-based methods tend to fail. The method is demonstrated by using 1,841 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) sequences which are classified into two major classes: HLA-I and HLA-II; each major class is further subdivided into sub-groups of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules. Using codon usage frequencies, binary SVM achieved accuracy rate of 99.3% for HLA major class classification and multi-class SVM achieved\u00a0\u2026", "Homologous recombination (HR) is critical for the repair of double strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although HR is mostly error free, inherent or environmental conditions that either suppress or induce HR cause genomic instability. Despite its importance in carcinogenesis, due to limitations in our ability to detect HR in vivo, little is known about HR in mammalian tissues. Here, we describe a mouse model in which a direct repeat HR substrate is targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice, HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues, and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues, wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally, de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon, showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide, shows that the colon, liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally, histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells. Taken together, the RaDR-GFP mouse model provides\u00a0\u2026", "Liver surface is covered by a collagenous layer called the Glisson's capsule. The structure of the Glisson's capsule is barely seen in the biopsy samples for histology assessment, thus the changes of the collagen network from the Glisson's capsule during the liver disease progression are not well studied. In this report, we investigated whether non\u2010linear optical imaging of the Glisson's capsule at liver surface would yield sufficient information to allow quantitative staging of liver fibrosis. In contrast to conventional tissue sections whereby tissues are cut perpendicular to the liver surface and interior information from the liver biopsy samples were used, we have established a capsule index based on significant parameters extracted from the second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy images of capsule collagen from anterior surface of rat livers.

The method is applied to brain scans of 80 healthy children and adolescents.Materials and MethodsA probabilistic data fusion equation was used to combine simultaneously acquired T2-weighted and proton density head scans for tissue segmentation. The fusion equation optimizes the probability of a voxel being a particular tissue type, given the corresponding probabilities from both images. The algorithm accounts for the intensity inhomogeneities present in the images by fusion of local regions of the images.ResultsThe method was validated using a phantom (agarose gel with iron oxide particles) and hand-segmented images.

Such a filter based criterion is generally computed using all the training samples, all of which, however, may not be equally important for classification task. In this paper, we decompose the t-statistic into two parts, corresponding to relevant and irrelevant data points. The relevant data points are selected using support vectors and then used to compute t-statistic for feature selection. By simultaneously selecting data points and genes, significantly better classification results are achieved on synthetic as well as on several benchmark cancer datasets.", "The performance of the ab inito gene prediction approaches mostly depends on the effectiveness of detecting the splice sites. This paper addresses the problem of splice site detection using higher-order Markov models. The tenet of our approach is to brace the higher-order dependencies of a Markov model by a neural network that receives the inputs from low-order Markov chains.", "This paper presents a conditional random field (CRF) approach to fuse contextual dependencies in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the detection of brain activation. The interactions among both activation (activated/inactive) labels and observed data of brain voxels are unified in a probabilistic framework based on the CRF, where the interaction strength can be adaptively adjusted in terms of the data similarity of neighboring sites. Compared to earlier detection methods, including statistical parametric mapping and Markov random field, the proposed method avoids the suppression of high frequency information and relaxes the strong assumption of conditional independence of observed data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively integrates contextual constraints within the detection process and robustly detects brain activities from fMRI data", "The ultimate goal of cancer proteomics is to adapt proteomic technologies for routine use in clinical laboratories for the purpose of diagnostic and prognostic classification of disease states, as well as in evaluating drug toxicity and efficacy. Analysis of tumor-specific proteomic profiles may also allow better understanding of tumor development and the identification of novel targets for cancer therapy. The biological variability among patient samples as well as the huge dynamic range of biomarker concentrations are currently the main challenges facing efforts to deduce diagnostic patterns that are unique to specific disease states. While several strategies exist to address this problem, we focus here on cancer classification using mass spectrometry (MS) for proteomic profiling and biomarker identification.

The selected gene subset has better classification accuracy and better generalization capability.", "A new formulation of energy minimising splines, based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curves, is presented. The existing snake models do not facilitate the local control of their shapes without increasing the number of control points. The introduction of NURBS renders more flexibility into the snake model due to the weighting parameters that are made to adapt according to the curvature of the contour. The proposed snake model was tested on both synthetic and real images; the new model demonstrated more local flexibility than the previous models and is capable of attracting to complex boundaries of the objects with increased accuracy.", "Background Influenza virus infection causes significantly higher levels of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Studies have shown that impaired immunity in the elderly contributes to the increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection, however, how aging affects the lung tissue damage and repair has not been completely elucidated. Methods Aged (16-18 months old) and young (2-3 months old) mice were infected with influenza virus intratracheally. Body weight and mortality were monitored. Different days after infection, lung sections were stained to estimate the overall lung tissue damage and for club cells, pro-SPC+ bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar type I and II cells to quantify their frequencies using automated image analysis algorithms.

Ideally, FPGA implementations, being directly in hardware and having parallelism, will have performance advantages over software on conventional machines. But there is a great deal to be done to make the most of FPGAs and to prove their worth in implementing neural networks, especially in view of past failures in the implementation of neurocomputers. This paper looks at some of the relevant issues.", "Monitoring liver fibrosis progression by liver biopsy is important for certain treatment decisions, but repeated biopsy is invasive. We envision redefinition or elimination of liver biopsy with surface scanning of the liver with minimally invasive optical methods. This would be possible only if the information contained on or near liver surfaces accurately reflects the liver fibrosis progression in the liver interior. In our study, we acquired the second-harmonic generation and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy images of liver tissues from bile duct-ligated rat model of liver fibrosis. We extracted morphology-based features, such as total collagen, collagen in bile duct areas, bile duct proliferation, and areas occupied by remnant hepatocytes, and defined the capsule and subcapsular regions on the liver surface based on image analysis of features.

Independent component analysis (ICA), an exploratory and unsupervised technique, separates various signal sources mixed in brain imaging signals such as brain activation and noise, assuming that the sources are mutually independent in the complete statistical sense. This paper summarizes various applications of ICA in processing brain imaging signals: EEG, MEG, fMRI or PET. We highlight the current issues and limitations of applying ICA in these applications, current, and future directions of research.", "Covariance-based methods of exploration of functional connectivity of the brain from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), require a priori knowledge such as an anatomical model to infer functional connectivity. In this research, a hybrid method, combining independent component analysis (ICA) and SEM, which is capable of deriving functional connectivity in an exploratory manner without the need of a prior model is introduced. The spatial ICA (SICA) derives independent neural systems or sources involved in task-related brain activation, while an automated method based on the SEM finds the structure of the connectivity among the elements in independent neural systems.

After 5days of differentiation, about 20\u201330% of mature neutrophils could be detected. Only a fraction of neutrophils were infected by highly virulent influenza (HVI) virus, but were unable to support active viral replication compared with MDCK cells. HVI infection of neutrophils augmented early and late apoptosis as indicated by annexin V and TUNEL assays. Comparison between the global transcriptomic responses of neutrophils to HVI and low virulent influenza (LVI) revealed that the IFN regulatory factor and IFN signaling pathways were the most significantly overrepresented pathways, with activation of related genes in HVI as early as 3h. Relatively consistent results were obtained by real-time RT-PCR of selected genes associated with the type I IFN pathway.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) approach, where the second MSVM predictor is introduced at the output of the first stage MSVM to capture the contextual relationship among secondary structure elements in order to minimise the generalisation error in the prediction. By using position-specific scoring matrices generated by PSI-BLAST, the two-stage MSVM approach achieves Q3 accuracies of 78.0% and 76.3% on the RS126 dataset of 126 non-homologous globular proteins and the CB396 dataset of 396 non-homologous proteins, respectively, which are better than the scores reported on both datasets to date.

We also found that, the best peak subset selected by SVM-RFE always have in the top ranked peaks by T-statistics while it includes some peaks that are ranked low by T-statistics. However, these peaks together give much better classification performance than the same number of most top ranked peaks by T-statistics.

Such techniques usually tend to bias toward a few classes that are easily distinguishable from other classes due to imbalances of strong features and sample sizes of different classes. It could therefore lead to selection of redundant genes while missing the relevant genes, leading to poor classification of tissue samples. In this manuscript, we propose to decompose multiclass ranking statistics into class-specific statistics and then use Pareto-front analysis for selection of genes. This alleviates the bias induced by class intrinsic characteristics of dominating classes. The use of Pareto-front analysis is demonstrated on two filter criteria commonly used for gene selection: F-score and KW-score.

Measures of FS between genes are mostly derived from Information Contents (IC) of Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotating the genes. However, existing measures evaluating IC of terms based either on the representations of terms in the annotating corpus or on the knowledge embedded in the GO hierarchy do not consider the enrichment of GO terms by the querying pair of genes. The enrichment of a GO term by a pair of gene is dependent on whether the term is annotated by one gene (i.e., partial annotation) or by both genes (i.e. complete annotation) in the pair.

Filter approaches to gene selection have been popular because of their simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy. Due to small sample size, all samples are generally used to compute relevant ranking statistics and selection of samples in filter-based gene selection methods has not been addressed. In this paper, we extend previously-proposed simultaneous sample and gene selection approach. In a backward elimination method, a modified logistic regression loss function is used to select relevant samples at each iteration, and these samples are used to compute the T-score to rank genes.

There is an increased interest in building gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from temporal gene expression data because of their numerous applications in life sciences. However, because of the limited number of time points at which gene expressions can be gathered in practice, computational techniques of building GRN often lead to inaccuracies and instabilities. This paper investigates the stability of sparse auto-regressive models of building GRN from gene expression data. Criteria for evaluating the stability of estimating GRN structure are proposed. Thereby, stability of multivariate vector autoregressive (MVAR) methods - ridge, lasso, and elastic-net - of building GRN were studied by simulating temporal gene expression datasets on scale-free topologies as well as on real data gathered over Hela cell-cycle. Effects of the number of time points on the stability of constructing GRN are investigated. When the number of time points are relatively low compared to the size of network, both accuracy and stability are adversely affected. At least, the number of time points equal to the number of genes in the network are needed to achieve decent accuracy and stability of the networks. Our results on synthetic data indicate that the stability of lasso and elastic-net MVAR methods are comparable, and their accuracies are much higher than the ridge MVAR. As the size of the network grows, the number of time points required to achieve acceptable accuracy and stability are much less relative to the\u00a0\u2026", "Feature selection is a commonly addressed problem in classification.

This paper proposes a variant of SVM-RFE to do gene selection for cancer classification with expression data. Multiple support vector machine classifiers from a leave-one-out procedure are used to compute the feature ranking scores. The numerical experiments also show the good and stable performance of the proposed method.", "Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental measure for many bioinformatics applications, such as determining functional similarity between genes or proteins. Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions. We conducted two kinds of experiments to evaluate the quality of GO2Vec: (1) functional similarity between proteins on the Collaborative Evaluation of GO-based Semantic Similarity Measures (CESSM) dataset and (2) prediction of protein-protein interactions on the Yeast and Human datasets from the STRING database. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GO2Vec over the information content-based measures and the word embedding-based measures. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using graph embeddings to learn vector representations from undirected GO and GOA graphs. Our results also demonstrate that GO annotations provide useful information for computing the similarity between GO terms and between proteins.", "Objective: To study the interaction between levodopa and the feedback process on set\u2010shifting in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Even before the reincarnation of the field of artificial neural networks in mid nineteen eighties, researchers have attempted to explore the engineering of human brain function. After the reincarnation, we have seen an emergence of a large number of neural network models and their successful applications to solve real world problems. This volume presents a collection of recent research and developments in the field of neural information processing. The book is organized in three Parts, ie,(1) architectures,(2) learning algorithms, and (3) applications. Artificial neural networks consist of simple processing elements called neurons, which are connected by weights. The number of neurons and how they are connected to each other defines the architecture of a particular neural network. Part 1 of the book has nine chapters, demonstrating some of recent neural network architectures derived either to mimic aspects of human brain function or applied in some real world problems.

The experiments on synthetic datasets show that the algorithm finds weak motif instances more accurately and efficiently compared to earlier approaches. Its performances on real datasets in finding transcription factor binding sites are comparable with the existing techniques.", "The performance of automated analysis of cellular images is heavily influenced by the features that characterize cells or cell nuclei. In this paper, an exhaustive set of features including morphological, topological, and texture features are explored to determine the optimal features for classification of cells and cell nuclei.

The results of feature selection indicate that Zernike moment, Daubechies wavelets, and Gabor wavelets give the most important features for the classification of cells or cell nuclei in fluorescent microscopy images.", "Reconstructing gene regulatory network (GRN) from time-series expression data has become increasingly popular since time course data contain temporal information about gene regulation. A typical microarray gene expression data contain expressions of thousands of genes but the number of time samples is usually very small. Therefore, inferring a GRN from such a high-dimensional expression data poses a major challenge. This paper proposes a tree based ensemble of random forests in a multivariate auto-regression framework to tackle this problem. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated on synthetic time-series datasets and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yeast) microarray gene expression data with 9-genes. The performance is comparable or better than GRN generated using dynamic Bayesian networks and ordinary differential equations (ODE) model.", "Ensemble learning and feature selection are two hot topics in machine learning and bioinformatics community, which have been widely used to improve generalization performance of single learning machines. For ensemble learning, a good ensemble is one whose individuals are both accurate and make their errors on different parts of the input space [1]. The most popular methods for ensemble creation are bagging and boosting [2, 3]. The effectiveness of such methods comes primarily from the diversity caused by resampling the training set [4]. For feature selection, different methods can be categorized into the filter model, the wrapper model, and the embedded model [5\u20137], where the filter model is independent of the learning machine and both the embedded model and the wrapper model depend on the learning machine, but the embedded model has lower computational complexity than the wrapper model\u00a0\u2026", "Presents a hierarchical neural network architecture which can achieve multisensor data fusion at feature level by combining the coherent activities of higher-level neurons in the architecture.

In this paper, we investigate how epigenetic data are incorporated into reconstruction of GRN. We encode the histone modification data as prior for Bayesian network inference of GRN.

Previous algorithms that aimed to solve the problem usually require a large amount of memory or execution time. In this paper, we proposed a fast and memory efficient algorithm, RecMotif, which guarantees to discover all motifs with specific (l, d) settings (where l is the motif length and d is the maximum number of mutations between a motif instance and the true motif). Comparisons with several recently proposed algorithms have shown that RecMotif is more scalable for handling longer and weaker motifs. For instance, it can solve the open challenge cases such as (40, 14) within 5 hours while the other algorithms compared failed due to either longer execution times or shortage of memory space. For real biological sequences, such as E.coli CRP, RecMotif is able to accurately discover the motif instances with (l, d) as (18, 6) in less than 1 second, which is faster than the other algorithms compared. RecMotif is a novel algorithm that requires only a space complexity of O(m2n) (where m is the number of sequences in the data and n is the length of the sequences).", "Motivation: Motifs in DNA sequences often appear in degenerate form, so there has been an increased interest in computational algorithms for weak motif discovery. Probabilistic algorithms are unable to detect weak motifs while exact methods have been able to detect only short weak motifs. This article proposes an exact tree-based motif detection (TreeMotif) algorithm capable of discovering longer and weaker motifs than by the existing methods.  Results: TreeMotif converts the graphical representation of motifs into a tree-structured representation in which a tree that branches with nodes from every sequence represents motif instances.

Interactions among brain regions are expressed by a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) while contextual dependencies within functional images are formulated by a Markov random field. The approach simultaneously considers both the detection of brain activation and the estimation of effective connectivity and does not require a priori model of connectivity.

For instance, large cohorts of patients are often screened using different high-throughput technologies, effectively producing multiple patient-specific molecular profiles for hundreds or thousands of patients. We propose and implement a network-based method that integrates such patient omics data into Patient Similarity Networks. Topological features derived from these networks were then used to predict relevant clinical features. As part of the 2017 CAMDA challenge, we have successfully applied this strategy to a neuroblastoma dataset, consisting of genomic and transcriptomic data. In particular, we observe that models built on our network-based approach perform at least as well as state of the art models. We furthermore explore the effectiveness of various topological features and observe, for instance, that redundant centrality metrics can be combined to build more powerful models. We demonstrate that the networks inferred from omics data contain clinically relevant information and that patient clinical outcomes can be predicted using only network topological data.

Beyond the PEXEL/VTS pathway and its characterized players, increasing amount of evidence has highlighted the existence of proteins exported using alternative export\u2010signal(s)/pathway(s); hence, the exportomes currently predicted are incomplete. The nature of these exported proteins which could have a prominent role in most of the Plasmodium species remains elusive. Using P.\u2009yoelii variant proteins, we identified a signal associated to lipophilic region that mediates export of P.\u2009yoelii proteins. This non\u2010PEXEL signal termed PLASMED is defined by semi\u2010conserved residues and possibly a secondary structure. In vivo characterization of exported\u2010proteins indicated that PLASMED is a bona fide export\u2010signal that allowed us to identify an unseen P\u00a0\u2026", "Deep neural networks have been demonstrated to extract high level features from neuroimaging data when classifying brain states. Identifying salient features characterizing brain states further refines the focus of clinicians and allows design of better diagnostic systems. We demonstrate this while performing classification of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of patients suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) subjects from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We use a 5-layer feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) to derive relevance scores of input features and show that an empirically selected subset of features improves accuracy scores for patient classification. The common distinctive salient brain regions were in the uncus and medial temporal lobe which closely correspond with\u00a0\u2026", "An imaging system is provided that includes a pulsed light source providing pulsed light and is applicable to both microscopes and endoscopes. One or more optical elements with certain dispersive properties are positioned to receive the pulsed light and apply selective dispersive properties to shift the focal plane according to the user and to produce two photon (2p) wide field uniform illumination and 2p wide field structured illumination for the purpose of improving the optical axial resolution and rejection of background signal. An imaging element receives the signal arising from the 2p wide field uniform illumination and 2p wide field structured illumination and produces a respective 3D resolved image of a sample.", "Previously, only pairwise temporal correlation and Principal Component Analysis have been exploited for functional connectivity of the brain, which were based on second-order statistics. In this work, we developed a new concept of functional connectivity in the higher-order statistical sense and used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for detecting connected brain regions. The fMRI datasets from resting brain were processed with eigenimage analysis and ICA, respectively, which showed an accordance with previous observations. The patterns of functional connectivity from both techniques were also compared. The applicability of ICA was demonstrated by finding higher-order functional connectivity with more number of components and less noisy imperfection.", "The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not unitary as heterogeneity exists in the disease's clinical and anatomical characteristics. MRI studies have revealed that heterogeneous gray matter atrophy patterns are associated with specific traits of cognitive decline. Although white matter (WM) impairment also contributes to AD pathology, its heterogeneity remains unclear. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method is a suitable framework to study heterogeneity and allows to identify latent impairment factors of AD instead of simply mapping an overall disease effect. By exploring whole brain WM skeleton images by using LDA, three latent factors were revealed in AD: a temporal-frontal impairment factor (temporal and frontal lobes, especially hippocampus and para-hippocampus), a parietal factor (parietal lobe, especially precuneus), and a long fibre bundle factor (corpus callosum and superior\u00a0\u2026", "Essential events of cell development and homeostasis are revealed by the associated changes of cell morphology and therefore have been widely used as a key indicator of physiological states and molecular pathways affecting various cellular functions via cytoskeleton. Cell motility is a complex phenomenon primarily driven by the actin network, which plays an important role in shaping the morphology of the cells. Most of the morphology based features are approximated from cell periphery but its dynamics have received none to scant attention. We aim to bridge the gap between membrane dynamics and cell states from the perspective of whole cell movement by identifying cell edge patterns and its correlation with cell dynamics. We present a systematic study to extract, classify, and compare cell dynamics in terms of cell motility and edge activity. Cell motility features extracted by fitting a persistent random walk were used to identify the initial set of cell subpopulations. We propose algorithms to extract edge features along the entire cell periphery such as protrusion and retraction velocity. These constitute a unique set of multivariate time-lapse edge features that are then used to profile subclasses of cell dynamics by unsupervised clustering. By comparing membrane dynamic patterns exhibited by each subclass of cells, correlated trends of edge and cell movements were identified. Our findings are consistent with published literature and we also identified that motility patterns are influenced by edge features from initial time points compared to later sampling intervals.", "Pulse-modulated second harmonic imaging microscopes (PM-SHIMs) exhibit improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over conventional SHIMs on sensitive imaging and quantification of weak collagen signals inside tissues. We quantify the spatial distribution of sparse collagen inside a xenograft model of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor specimens treated with a new drug against receptor tyrosine kinase (ABT-869), and observe a significant increase in collagen area percentage, collagen fiber length, fiber width, and fiber number after chemotherapy. This finding reveals new insights into tumor responses to chemotherapy and suggests caution in developing new drugs and therapeutic regimens against cancers.", "Although numerous computational techniques have been applied to predict protein secondary structure (PSS), only limited studies have dealt with discovery of logic rules underlying the prediction itself. Such rules offer interesting links between the prediction model and the underlying biology. In addition, they enhance interpretability of PSS prediction by providing a degree of transparency to the predicting model usually regarded as a black box. In this paper, we explore the generation and use of C4.5 decision trees to extract relevant rules from PSS predictions modeled with two-stage support vector machines (TS-SVM). The proposed rules were derived on the RS126 data set of 126 nonhomologous globular proteins and on the PSIPRED data set of 1,923 protein sequences. Our approach has produced sets of comprehensible, and often interpretable, rules underlying the PSS predictions. Moreover, many of the\u00a0\u2026", "Extracting brain rhythms from EEG signals has many applications including Brain Computer Interfacing. Here, we demonstrate how ICA with Reference (ICA-R) is used to extract brain rhythms, using appropriate reference signals. In particular, we evaluate four criteria for generating reference signals to use with ICA-R. We demonstrate the performance of these techniques in extracting mu and beta rhythms from two real EEG datasets. The results indicate that ICA-R can be effectively used for extracting brain rhythms. The blind source separation technique decomposing autocorrelation for extracting reference signals outperformed other methods.", "The multilayer adaptive resonance architecture (MARA) is a highly stable and plastic self-organizing neural network which is capable of recognizing, reconstructing, and segmenting the traces of previously learned binary patterns. The recognition and reconstruction properties of the network are invariant with respect to distortion, noise, translation, scaling and partial rotation of the original training patterns. If multiple traces of trained patterns are simultaneously presented, the network can separate and reconstruct the traces separately. A description is given of MARA and an image segmentation scheme using MARA. MARA's ability to segment some biological structures in high-speed synchronous volume CT images of the heart is demonstrated", "We propose a method to build gene regulatory networks (GRN) capable of representing time-delayed regulations. The gene expression data is represented in two types of graphical models: a linear model using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and a skip model using a hidden Markov model. The linear model is designed to find short-delays and skip model for long-delays. The algorithm was tested on time-series data obtained on yeast cell-cycle and validated against protein\u2013protein interaction data. The proposed method better fits expression profiles compared to classical higher-order DBN and found core genes that are crucial in cell-cycle regulation.", "Functional modules in the human brain support its drive for specialization whereas brain hubs act as focal points for information integration. Brain hubs are brain regions that have a large number of both within and between module connections. We argue that weak connections in brain functional networks lead to misclassification of brain regions as hubs. In order to resolve this, we propose a new measure called ambivert degree that considers the node\u2019s degree as well as connection weights in order to identify nodes with both high degree and high connection weights as hubs. Using resting-state functional MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project, we show that ambivert degree identifies brain hubs that are not only crucial but also invariable across subjects. We hypothesize that nodal measures based on ambivert degree can be effectively used to classify patients from healthy controls for diseases that are\u00a0\u2026", "Image registration is formulated as a problem of finding optimal linear intensity and spatial transformations. A genetic algorithm is proposed to find optimal parameters of the transformations. The new approach is used to register functional MR time series images of the human brain to compensate for subject head movement.", "Specialized processing in the brain is performed by multiple groups of brain regions organized as functional modules. Although, in vivo studies of brain functional modules involve multiple functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans, the methods used to derive functional modules from functional networks of the brain ignore individual differences in the functional architecture and use incomplete functional connectivity information. To correct this, we propose an Iterative Consensus Spectral Clustering (ICSC) algorithm that detects the most representative modules from individual dense weighted connectivity matrices derived from multiple scans. The ICSC algorithm derives group-level modules from modules of multiple individuals by iteratively minimizing the consensus-cost between the two. We demonstrate that the ICSC algorithm can be used to derive biologically plausible group-level (for multiple subjects\u00a0\u2026", "Temporal autocorrelation present in functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) data poses challenges to its analysis. The existing approaches handling autocorrelation in fMRI time-series often presume a specific model of autocorrelation such as an auto-regressive model. The main limitation here is that the correlation structure of voxels is generally unknown and varies in different brain regions because of different levels of neurogenic noises and pulsatile effects. Enforcing a universal model on all brain regions leads to bias and loss of efficiency in the analysis. In this paper, we propose the mixed spectrum analysis of the voxel time-series to separate the discrete component corresponding to input stimuli and the continuous component carrying temporal autocorrelation. A mixed spectral analysis technique based on M-spectral estimator is proposed, which effectively removes autocorrelation effects from voxel time\u00a0\u2026", "Inferring a time-delayed gene regulatory network from microarray gene-expression is challenging due to the small numbers of time samples and requirements to estimate a large number of parameters. In this paper, we present a two-step approach to tackle this challenge: first, an unbiased cross-correlation is used to determine the probable list of time-delays and then, a penalized regression technique such as the LASSO is used to infer the time-delayed network. This approach is tested on several synthetic and one real dataset. The results indicate the efficacy of the approach with promising future directions.", "We introduce a probabilistic framework for building higher-order gene regulatory networks, which automatically finds the delays of regulatory interactions. A variable-order Markov chain Monte Carlo method with a new acceptance mechanism is proposed to find the optimal order and the structure of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). Experiments on cell cycle expression data indicate that the variable-order DBN (VDBN) better fits the data and gives biologically more plausible regulatory networks.", "T-score between classes and gene expressions is widely used for gene ranking in microarray gene expression data analysis. We propose to use only support vector points for computation of t-scores for gene ranking. The proposed method uses backward elimination of features, similar to Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) formulation, but achieves better results than SVM-RFE and t-score based feature selection on three benchmark cancer datasets.", "Knowledge of protein-protein interaction sites is vital to determine proteins' function and involvement in different pathways. Though a wide variety of methods has been proposed over the recent years in order to predict protein-protein interface residues, mainly based on single amino acid sequence inputs, each has its own drawbacks and limitations. We propose to use support vector machines (SVM) to predict protein-protein interface residues by using the information derived from the position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) generated from PSI-BLAST profiles and accessible surface areas. The present approach achieved overall prediction accuracy of 73.8% for 77 individulal proteins collected from the Protein Data Bank, which is better than the previously reported accuracies", "Extracting the human brain from magnetic resonance head scans is difficult because of its highly convoluted and nonuniform geometry. A technique based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surfaces and energy minimizing deformable models to extract and visualize the brain surface patterns accurately from magnetic resonance head scans is presented. The weighting parameter that comes with the NURBS definition is explored to attract the surface into regions showing high curvature. The weight at each control point is adjusted automatically according to the curvature properties of the evolving surface. This process facilitates a deformable model with increased local flexibility that adapts to complex geometrical features of the brain surface. The results show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the correct brain surface with a higher accuracy than the existing techniques.", "Time-series provided by high-resolution functional MR imaging (fMRI) bear rich information of underlying physiological processes and associated hemodynamic events of human brain activation during sensory and cognitive stimulation. A computational model to represent neuronal and hemodynamic events in fMRI time-series is presented where the transient neuronal activities are modeled with exponential functions and coupling between neuronal response and hemodynamic response is approximated by a linear convolution. The hemodynamic parameters, namely lag and dispersion, and neuronal parameters, namely rise time and fall time, quantitate some of the neuronal and hemodynamic events following a sensory, motor, or cognitive task. Methods to estimate neuronal responses with hemodynamic demodulation and parameters assuming exponential transient changes are presented. Experiments with simulated time-series demonstrate the robustness of the parameter estimation scheme and with fMRI data obtained in a memory retrieval task is used to illustrate how the model parameters can improve detection of relevant activation in fMRI. This paper highlights the potentials of fMRI to study neuronal populations and the use of the proposed model in identifying neurophysiological events of brain function.", "Weak motif discovery is a fundamental problem in computational biology. It is difficult to solve because the number of mismatches between the true motif and its mutated instances is so large that the spurious signals may disguise the true ones. While many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, they either require a large amount of memory or consume too much time. In this paper, a sample-driven algorithm, ListMotif, is proposed, which uses the substrings from the data to construct lists of motif instances. ListMotif is memory efficient and by avoiding re-calculations on the hamming distances between the substrings it also exhibits time efficiency. The experiments on real biological data have demonstrated its applicability in practice. Meanwhile, the test results on synthetic data show that ListMotif is able to discover longer and weaker motifs compared to some previously proposed algorithms.", "We present an image analysis pipeline for identifying cells in histopathology images of cancer. The analysis starts with segmentation using multi-phase level sets, which is insensitive to initialization and enables automatic detection of arbitrary objects. Morphological operations are used to remove small spots in the segmented images. The target cells are then identified based on their features. The detected cells were compared with the manual detection performed by pathologists. The quantitative evaluation shows promise and utility of our technique.", "The field of bioinformatics has two main objectives: the creation and maintenance of biological databases, and the discovery of knowledge from life sciences data in order to unravel the mysteries of biological function, leading to new drugs and therapies for human disease. Life sciences data come in the form of biological sequences, structures, pathways, or literature. One major aspect of discovering biological knowledge is to search, predict, or model specific patterns present in a given dataset and then to interpret those patterns. Computer science methods such as evolutionary computation, machine learning, and data mining all have a great deal to offer the field of bioinformatics. The goal of the Fifth European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning, and Data Mining in Bioinformatics (EvoBIO 2007) was to bring experts in computer science together with experts in bioinformatics and the biological sciences to explore new and novel methods for solving complex biological problems. The fifth EvoBIO conference was held in Valencia, Spain during April 11-13, 2007 at the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia. EvioBIO 2007 was held jointly with the Tenth European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP 2007), the Seventh European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation (EvoCOP 2007), and the Evo Workshops. Collectively, the conferences and workshops are organized under the name Evo*(www. evostar. org).

The technique is tested on available EEC data on a picture matching task performed by alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects. The accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of ICA-R are demonstrated in extracting the relevant components of single-trial ERPs.", "In order to conduct many non-intrusive clinical studies of the human brain, an accurate model that is capable of extracting the brain matter from magnetic resonance images (MRI) is required. We present a fully automated two-stage procedure to extract the brain matter accurately from a database of T1-weighted, high-quality MRI of healthy subjects. The procedure is initiated using a three dimensional (3D) segmentation process to separate the brain from other anatomical structures. The extracted brain is then subjected to an adaptive filter to remove cerebro-spinal fluid that fills sulcal cavities. The experiments clearly demonstrate the capability of the present technique in accurately peeling the brain. The accuracy of the results is tested using relative gray and white matter concentrations of both simulated and real MR images.", "With an aging population, the number of patients with dementia is increasing, and will potentially become a major social health cost issue. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for more than 40% of dementias in the elderly. The clinical manifestation of AD may be subtle, and early diagnosis is difficult but crucial, to enable early drug intervention and improved prognosis. In order to early diagnose AD, we applied MR volumetry techniques for the hippocampus and cerebrum in an attempt to detect the early changes of AD. From an eligible population of 103 AD patients, 11 with early AD were identified and had MRI performed. 12 normal age-matched controls were also recruited. All AD patients evaluation was based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. We compared cerebral and hippocampal volumes of the two groups: normal and AD patients, and found statistically significant difference of total brain volume and\u00a0\u2026", "The paper introduces a complete segmentation algorithm based on fuzzy-region-growing (FRG). It serves to examine the efficacy of the FRG algorithm without incorporation of high level knowledge. The complete fuzzy segmentation procedure makes use of the fuzzy regions grown from different seeds to complete the automated image segmentation. Experimental results on simple synthetic and real MR images are shown to demonstrate the validity of the algorithm.", "Cerebral MRI scans of 105 healthy children and adolescents, ages 4-18, were analyzed to assess the effects of age and gender on the sizes of the cerebrum, cerebellum, caudate, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and lateral ventricles in normal development.  Significant gender effects were noted for several structures.  Males had a 10% larger cerebral and 7% larger cerebellar volume, which remained statistically significant after correction for height and weight (p < 0.001).  After adjusting for total cerebral volume, putamen and globus pallidus remained larger in males, while caudate volume was larger in females.  Cerebral volume as a whole did not change significantly across this age span; however, cerebellar volume increased 18%.  In males only, caudate and putamen decreased with age (p = 0.007 and 0.004, respectively).  Lateral ventricular volume increased for both genders (p = 0.0007 for males, 0.05 for females), with males showing a significant increase in slope after age 11 (p = 0.03).  For cerebral hemispheres and lateral ventricles, there was a significantly greater left than right asymmetry (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.02, respectively).  In contrast, caudate and globus pallidus showed a greater right than left asymmetry (p < 0.001).  The volumes of all structures demonstrated a high degree of natural variability.  Females exhibited significantly larger variability than males, after correcting for age, height, and weight effects, for all structures except the globus pallidus (equal variability) and cerebellum (less variability).  These findings highlight the need for relatively large gender-matched samples in developmental brain\u00a0\u2026", "Neuroscientific knowledge points to the presence of redundancy in the correlations of the brain\u2019s functional activity. These redundancies can be removed to mitigate the problem of overfitting when deep neural network (DNN) models are used to classify neuroimaging datasets. We propose an algorithm that removes insignificant nodes of DNNs in a layerwise manner and then adds a subset of correlated features in a single shot. When performing experiments with functional MRI datasets for classifying patients from healthy controls, we were able to obtain simpler and more generalizable DNNs. The obtained DNNs maintained a similar performance as the full network with only around 2% of the initial trainable parameters. Further, we used the trained network to identify salient brain regions and connections from functional connectome for multiple brain disorders. The identified biomarkers were found to closely\u00a0\u2026", "Systematic fusion of multiple data sources for Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) inference remains a key challenge in systems biology. We incorporate information from protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) into the process of GRN inference from gene expression (GE) data. However, existing PPIN remain sparse and transitive protein interactions can help predict missing protein interactions. We therefore propose a systematic probabilistic framework on fusing GE data and transitive protein interaction data to coherently build GRN. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to soft-cluster GE data, allowing overlapping cluster memberships. Next, a heuristic method is proposed to extend sparse PPIN by incorporating transitive linkages. We then propose a novel way to score extended protein interactions by combining topological properties of PPIN and correlations of GE. Following this, GE data and extended PPIN are fused using a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) in order to identify gene regulatory pathways and refine interaction scores that are then used to constrain the GRN structure. We employ a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (BGM) model to refine the GRN derived from GE data by using the structural priors derived from GHMM. Experiments on real yeast regulatory networks demonstrate both the feasibility of the extended PPIN in predicting transitive protein interactions and its effectiveness on improving the coverage and accuracy the proposed method of fusing PPIN and GE to build GRN. The GE and PPIN fusion model outperforms both the state-of-the-art single data source models (CLR, GENIE3, TIGRESS) as well as existing\u00a0\u2026", "Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring progression of liver fibrosis associated with an abnormal increase in collagen. Descriptive scoring systems are still being widely used to grade biopsy samples. In this study, we propose a new set of features by clustering collagen fibers into three groups first based on their localization and connectivity properties, and then by extracting morphological features of collagen fibers. The new feature set is compared to the earlier features used in classification of liver fibrosis, which were based on the total amount of collagen fibers. Our results show that new features lead to more accurate grading of liver fibrosis.", "The existing independent component neural netw orks (ICNNs) in the literature need same number of output neurons as the input nodes to achieve independence among output activations. We present a tec hnique to learn the undercomplete ICNNs to produce an output with an low er dimension than the input by using joint entropy of a multidimensional Gaussian to approximate the mutual entrop y of the output. Our approach is not restricted by the squared Jacobian matrix of outputs with respect to the inputs, and gives a general rule and some criteria to extract both super-and sub-Gaussianly distributed signals and remove the Gaussian distributed noise. Simulation results with simulated signals and audio signals are provided.", "Radiation therapy is a treatment modality which seeks to deliver radiation energy to a localized site within a patient in order to destroy a malignant tumor. One of the most important aspects of radiation dose treatment planning is the accurate localization of tumor masses. An improved methodology is proposed for the delineation of tumors. Tumor localization is performed using a regularization approach which incorporates data fusion techniques. The contour information, derived from magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography, is used to enhance the delineation of tumor boundaries. Directional controlled continuity stabilizers are utilized to perform the fusion task.< >", "This work summarizes our submission for the Task 3: Disease Classification of ISIC 2018 challenge in Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. We use a novel deep neural network (DNN) ensemble architecture introduced by us that can effectively classify skin lesions by using data-augmentation and bagging to address paucity of data and prevent over-fitting. The ensemble is composed of two DNN architectures: Inception-v4 and Inception-Resnet-v2. The DNN architectures are combined in to an ensemble by using a  convolution for fusion in a meta-learning layer.", "This paper summarizes the method used in our submission to Task 1 of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration's (ISIC) Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection challenge held in 2018. We used a fully automated method to accurately segment lesion boundaries from dermoscopic images. A U-net deep learning network is trained on publicly available data from ISIC. We introduce the use of intensity, color, and texture enhancement operations as pre-processing steps and morphological operations and contour identification as post-processing steps.", "Classification of genes into biologically related groups facilitates inference of their functions. Codon usage bias has been described previously as a potential feature for gene classification. In this paper, we demonstrate that di-codon usage can further improve classification of genes. By using both codon and di-codon features, we achieve near perfect accuracies for the classification of HLA molecules into major classes and sub-classes. The method is illustrated on 1,841 HLA sequences which are classified into two major classes, HLA-I and HLA-II. Major classes are further classified into sub-groups. A binary SVM using di-codon usage patterns achieved 99.95% accuracy in the classification of HLA genes into major HLA classes; and multi-class SVM achieved accuracy rates of 99.82% and 99.03% for sub-class classification of HLA-I and HLA-II genes, respectively.

We illustrate how this approach sorts independent components (ICs) in the order of significance according to some statistic and normalizes the demixing matrix or the energies of separated ICs automatically. With some prior information, the algorithm is able to identify and extract the original sources perfectly from their mixtures. The experiments with synthetic signals and audio signals demonstrate the efficacy and usage of eliminating indeterminacy in the ICA.", "To extract consistently and transiently task-related component maps, a novel ICA paradigm, the ICA with reference (ICA-R), is proposed. ICA-R produces only component maps corresponding to the input stimuli which are used as reference signals in the learning paradigm, and all activations corresponding to a particular stimulus are located in a single component map. Computational and memory requirements of ICA-R are much less than those required by spatial ICA or temporal ICA.", "Point count stereology is a useful tool in obtaining volumetric measures of objects in three\u2010dimensional (3D) images when the segmentation of objects is not feasible. Presently, fixed\u2010grid 3D stereology is being used where a 3D parallelepiped grid is randomly placed for sampling the image space in order to generate test points. Although this is a popular technique, the use of a fixed grid introduces errors in the final estimate in practice and makes the technique inefficient. Random\u2010grid 3D stereology is introduced to improve the efficiency of the volume estimates in stereology. In this manuscript, we prove random\u2010grid stereology as a more consistent technique than fixed\u2010grid stereology and use it for volumetry of the brain and ventricles in magnetic resonance (MR) head scans.

Huge dimensionalities of neuroimaging data as well as omics data pose tremendous challenge for methods integrating multiple modalities. There are few existing solutions that can combine both multi-modal imaging and multi-omics datasets to derive neurological insights. We propose a deep neural network architecture that combines both structural and functional connectome data with multi-omics data for disease classification. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) are used to model functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data simultaneously to learn compact representations of the connectome. A separate set of GCNs are then used to model multi-omics datasets, expressed in the form of patient similarity networks, and combine them with latent representations of the connectome. An attention mechanism is used to fuse the GCN outputs, which provides insights on which omics data contributed most to the model's classification decision. We demonstrate our methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification by using datasets from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). PD has been shown to be associated with changes in the human connectome and it is also known to be influenced by genetic factors. We combine DTI and fMRI data with multi-omics data from messenger RNA Expression, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), DNA Methylation and non-coding RNA experiments. To address the paucity of multi-modal imaging data, we used CycleGAN on structural and\u00a0\u2026", "This study aims at predicting affective states during programming using keyboard and mouse data. The article proposes and evaluates a novel set of features under programming context to predict affective states. Fourteen undergraduate participants performed three programming tasks of varying difficulties. At the completion of each task, participants reported their affective states by viewing webcam videos and screen recordings. Features extracted from keyboard and mouse logs were used to train multiple classifiers. Among trained classifiers, feedforward neural network recognized positive, neutral and negative states with 52.9% accuracy. The overall Cohen's Kappa reached 0.27. Without neutral states, the classifiers were able to differentiate positive and negative states with 74.1% accuracy and 0.48 Kappa.

This method improves on existing structured light imaging modalities by reassigning fluorescence photons generated from off-focal plane excitation, improving in-focus signal strength. Utilizing a maximum likelihood approach, we identify the most likely fluorophore distribution in 3D that will produce the observed image stacks under structured and uniform illumination using an iterative maximization algorithm. Our results show the optical sectioning capability of tissue specimens while mostly preserving image stack photon count, which is usually not achievable with other existing structured light imaging methods.", "Background High content screening techniques are increasingly used to understand the regulation and progression of cell motility. The demand of new platforms, coupled with availability of terabytes of data has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual methods and resulted in development of high-dimensional analytical methods. Results In this paper, we present sub-populations analysis of cells at the tissue level by using dynamic features of the cells. We used active contour without edges for segmentation of cells, which preserves the cell morphology, and autoregressive modeling to model cell trajectories. The sub-populations were obtained by clustering static, dynamic and a combination of both features. We were able to identify three unique sub-populations in combined clustering\u00a0\u2026", "Background Time delays are often found in gene regulation though most techniques of building gene regulatory networks are not capable of capturing such phenomena. Here we look at the delays in the DNA repair system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is unusually slow in the bacteria. We propose a method based on a skip-chain model to study this phenomena in gene networks. The Viterbi paths of the underlying Markov chains find the most likely regulatory interactions among genes, taking care of very long delays. Using the derived networks, we discuss the delayed regulations and robustness of the DNA damage seen in the bacterium.

Five discriminating features are extracted from fMRI data by using a sequence of temporal-sliding-windows. Fuzzy membership maps of individual subjects obtained through clustering with spatial regularization is capable of taking into account both hemodynamic variability and contextual information of brain activation. The present method outperforms statistical parametric mapping (SPM) approach on experiments with synthetic fMRI data contaminated by both independent and correlated noise. Performance on real fMRI data are comparable to those obtained with SPM.", null, "A novel approach for gene classification is proposed, which adopts codon usage bias pattern as feature vector for the subsequent classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). A given DNA sequence is first converted to 59-dimensional feature vector, each element corresponding to the relative synonymous usage frequency of a codon. Therefore, the input to the classifier is independent of the size of the DNA sequences. Therefore, our approach is useful when the genes to be classified are of different length, where the homology-based methods are inapplicable due to the difficulty in the alignment of sequences having different lengths. The applicability and usage of the present method is demonstrated by a classification of 1841 HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) coding sequences selected from the database of IMGT/HLA. Using the codon usage frequencies, the binary SVM achieved accuracy up to 99.30\u00a0\u2026", "Low-order Markov models are insufficient to represent hidden and complex features surrounding translation initiation sites (TISs). We present a neural network approach for detecting TISs of eukaryotes that combines lower-order models carrying biological knowledge, with nonlinearity, to capture higher-order nucleotide correlations at TISs and in the surrounding coding and noncoding regions. The model consists of Markov chain models of low-order, a protein encoding model, neural networks, and a ribosome scanning model. The Markov models capture the local interaction of coding and noncoding regions while the protein encoding model utilizes evolutionary information of proteins to encode the downstream coding sequence of the TIS. With the incorporation of ribosome scanning model, the present method allows for incorporating the biological contextual information of potential TIS into the neural network\u00a0\u2026", "Fuzzy mean point clustering neural network (FMPCNN) is proposed with its learning algorithm, which utilizes fuzzy sets as pattern clusters.

This paper focuses mainly on the following aspects, such as the heuristics of updating weights using an evolutionary least square based algorithm, finding the number of hidden neurons for a two layer feed forward multilayered perceptron (MLP), the stopping criteria for the algorithm and finally comparisons of the results with other traditional methods for searching optimal or near optimal solution in the multidimensional complex search space comprising the architecture and the weight variables.

However, previous research on PPI prediction rarely considered missing and spurious interactions in PPI networks. To address these two issues, we define two corresponding tasks, namely missing PPI prediction and spurious PPI prediction, and propose a novel method that employs graph embeddings to learn vector representations from constructed Gene Ontology (GO) annotation graphs. Our method leverages the information from both term-term relations among GO terms and term-protein annotations between GO terms and proteins, and preserves properties of both local and global structural information of the GO annotation graph.

To fully leverage this in\u00a0situ approach, we need better ways to quantify rare fluorescent cells deep within tissues. Here, we present a robust, automated event quantification algorithm that uses image intensity and gradient features to detect fluorescent cells in deep tissue specimens. To analyze the performance of our algorithm, we simulate fluorescence behavior in tissue using Monte Carlo methods. Importantly, this approach reduces the potential for bias in manual counting and enables quantification of samples with highly dense HR events.

Various network models, such as power-law networks and modular networks have been explored before to study brain networks. In order to investigate the plausibility of modeling functional brain networks with network models based on distribution of node degree and connection weights, we will compute the goodness-of-fit of several network models on resting-state fMRI scans gathered in the Human Connectome Project. Our experiments suggest that the power-law networks and stochastic block models aptly fit functional connectivity of the subjects and the stochastic block models have the potential to detect functional modules of the brain.", "F-score is a widely used filter criteria for gene selection in multiclass cancer classification. This ranking criterion may become biased towards classes that have surplus of between-class sum of squares, resulting in inferior classification performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose to compute individual class wise between-class sum of squares with Pareto frontal analysis to rank genes. We tested our approach on four multiclass cancer gene expression datasets and the results show improvement in classification performance.", "Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) is important in understanding signal transduction pathways. This involves predicting the correct sequence of interactions and identifying all interacting genes. Using only gene expression data is insufficient, so additional sources of data like protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) are required. In this paper, we model time delayed interactions using a skip-chain model which finds missing edges between non-consecutive time points based on PPIN. Highest Viterbi approximation is used to select skip-edges. The k-skip validation model checks for k missing genes between a predicted interaction, giving us advantages of validation as well as expansion of GRN. The method is demonstrated on a cell-division cycle data of S.cerevisiae (yeast). Comparison of the present method, with a previous approach of modeling PPIN by using a Gibbs prior are given.", "BLASTZ is a sequence alignment tool designed mainly for aligning neutrally evolved bio-sequences and has been the choice for aligning noncoding sequences. However, its running time is impractical for high throughput alignment of long sequences, for example, for the alignment of human and mouse genomes. In order to improve the performance and efficiency for alignment at genome scale, BLASTZ was implemented using the GLOBUS toolkit on a computing grid. A dynamic load balancing technique was introduced to achieve enhanced performance on a grid which consists of sources of heterogeneous characteristics, such as resources of different computational powers. The robustness of the implementation to disturbances due to other processes on the grid is demonstrated.", "We develop a technique to validate large-scale gene regulatory networks (GRN) by comparing with corresponding protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. The GRN are obtained with Bayesian networks while PPI networks are obtained from database of known PPI interactions. We look for exact matches and then reduced networks by skipping one or more genes in GRN. We demonstrate our technique on expression profiles of differentially expressed genes in the S. cerevisiae cell cycle. We validate GRNs against a merged database of 53235 genes. The precisions of GRN obtained over all genes were from 0.82 to 0.95 in all the phases. In particular we realized that one-skip and two-skip model significantly improved accuracy of the GRN of different phases of cell cycle.", "We propose a hybrid approach to predict the secondary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Many existing techniques predict the secondary structure at each position of amino acid sequences based on a local window of residues. By combining the Bayesian method that avoids the problems of considering only a local neighborhood with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which have optimal generalization, the new preditor achieves an accuracy of 70.9% when using the sevenfold cross validation on a database of 126 nonhomologous globular proteins. We show that it is possible to obtain a higher accuracy with the combined classifier than Bayesian classifier or Support Vector Machines, alone.", "Multi-omics data are increasingly being gathered for investigations of complex diseases such as cancer. However, high dimensionality, small sample size, and heterogeneity of different omics types pose huge challenges to integrated analysis. In this paper, we evaluate two network-based approaches for integration of multi-omics data in an application of clinical outcome prediction of neuroblastoma. We derive Patient Similarity Networks (PSN) as the first step for individual omics data by computing distances among patients from omics features. The fusion of different omics can be investigated in two ways: the network-level fusion is achieved using Similarity Network Fusion algorithm for fusing the PSNs derived for individual omics types; and the feature-level fusion is achieved by fusing the network features obtained from individual PSNs. We demonstrate our methods on two high-risk neuroblastoma datasets from\u00a0\u2026", "Time delays are important factors that are often neglected in gene regulatory network (GRN) inference models. Validating time delays from knowledge bases is a challenge since the vast majority of biological databases do not record temporal information of gene regulations. Biological knowledge and facts on gene regulations are typically extracted from bio-literature with specialized methods that depend on the regulation task. In this paper, we mine evidences for time delays related to the transcriptional regulation of yeast from the PubMed abstracts. Since the vast majority of abstracts lack quantitative time information, we can only collect qualitative evidences of time delays. Specifically, the speed-up or delay in transcriptional regulation rate can provide evidences for time delays (shorter or longer) in GRN. Thus, we focus on deriving events related to rate changes in transcriptional regulation. A corpus of yeast regulation related abstracts was manually labeled with such events. In order to capture these events automatically, we create an ontology of sub-processes that are likely to result in transcription rate changes by combining textual patterns and biological knowledge. We also propose effective feature extraction methods based on the created ontology to identify the direct evidences with specific details of these events. Our ontologies outperform existing state-of-the-art gene regulation ontologies in the automatic rule learning method applied to our corpus. The proposed deterministic ontology rule-based method can achieve comparable performance to the automatic rule learning method based on decision trees. This demonstrates the\u00a0\u2026", "Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring progression of liver fibrosis which is associated with an abnormal increase in collagen, and descriptive scoring systems are still being used to grade biopsy samples. Several studies have built classification systems to automatically score liver fibrosis. However, all these systems have been established for stained samples or to measure only the collagen percentage. In this paper, an automated scoring system for liver fibrosis is designed for second harmonic generation images, which measures not only the collagen percentage but also quantifies morphological features of collagen fibers as well. The applicability of different collagen segmentation algorithms for liver fibrosis scoring is investigated. By proposing a Gaussian-mixture-model based method to quantify collagen percentage and using other morphological features of collagen fibers, high specificity and sensitivity of scoring, of early and late stage fibrosis are achieved with a neural network classifier.", "Genes are often classified into biologically related groups so that inferences on their functions can be made. This paper demonstrates that the di-codon usage is a useful feature for gene classification and gives better classification accuracy than the codon usage. Our experiments with different classifiers show that support vector machines performs better than other classifiers in classifying genes by using di-codon usage as features. The method is illustrated on 1841 HLA sequences which are classified into two major classes, HLA-I and HLA-II, and further classified into the subclasses of major classes. By using both codon and di-codon features, we show near perfect accuracies in the classification of HLA molecules into major classes and their sub-classes.", "Bioinformatics techniques to relative solvent accessibility (RSA) prediction are mostly single-stage approaches; they predict solvent accessibility of proteins by taking into account only the information available in amino acid sequences. We propose to use support vector machines (SVMs) as a second stage following the existing single-stage approaches for RSA prediction problem to improve the accuracy. The purpose of the second stage is to capture the contextual relationship of solvent accessibility elements in a neighborhood in determining the solvent accessibility at a particular site. We demonstrate our approach by introducing SVMs to the output of single-stage SVM classifier. Two-stage SVM approach achieves accuracies up to 90.4% and 90.2% on the Manesh dataset of 215 protein structures and the RS126 dataset of 126 nonhomologous globular proteins, respectively, which are better than the highest\u00a0\u2026", "This paper proposes a novel approach for elimination of various artifacts and noise from fMRI signals by using independent component analysis (ICA).

The effect of the denoising scheme was explored both on a fMRI dataset collected from a visual task experiment and a synthetic one, where we applied the fast ICA algorithm for noise removal. The noisy dataset and the demised one were both processed by a correlation technique to compare their capabilities of activation detection. From this study it can be concluded that ICA technique is possible for restoration of fMR images thus improving the efficacy of detection techniques of activation.", "During task performance, brain states change dynamically and can appear recurrently. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been used for identifying functional signatures underlying such brain states from task functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. While RNNs only model temporal dependence between time points, brain task decoding needs to model temporal dependencies of the underlying brain states. Furthermore, as only a subset of brain regions are involved in task performance, it is important to consider subsets of brain regions for brain decoding. To address these issues, we present a customised neural network architecture, Salient Patterns Over Time and Space (SPOTS), which not only captures dependencies of brain states at different time points but also pays attention to key brain regions associated with the task.

Given a set of genes, a Gene Ontology Network (GON) can be constructed from the corresponding GO annotations and semantic relations among GO terms. Transitive rules can be applied to GO semantic relations to infer transitive regulations among genes. Using information content as a measure of functional specificity, a shortest regulatory path detection algorithm is developed to identify transitive regulations in GON. Since direct regulations may be overlooked during the detection of gene regulations, gene functional similarities deduced from GO terms are used to detect direct gene regulations. Both direct and transitive GO regulations are then used to construct a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN).

However, it uses all the training samples in ranking, which may not be equally important for the classification.

To remove such bias, we use only the support vectors for computation of correlation coefficient and propose a backward elimination based SVcc-RFE algorithm. The proposed method is tested on several benchmark cancer gene expression datasets and the results show improvement in classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.", null, "The information stored in DNA, a chain of four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C), is first converted to mRNA through the process of transcription and then converted to the functional form of life, proteins, through the process of translation.

In this paper, we consider the visual reconstruction problem with multi-sensor data and propose a computational method for fusion of sensor information. Correlation among different sensor information appears in some hidden representation of data. In our representation of visual data, the fusion of information occurs at the places where visual discontinuities appear. The appearance of discontinuities in one set of data is constrained by the discontinuity contours in other sets of data. This is achieved by introducing energies of external discontinuity cliques of multiple sensor data to the minimizing energy functional.

Since the neurons at higher levels are insensitive to distortion, noise, scaling, and displacement of the activities at lower levels, the activities of higher-level neurons in these networks processing different sensor information can be combined. The proposed architecture consists of a fusion path to carry the combined information to indicate the final decision. The fusion architecture is used to recognize the traces of trained patterns in low-quality images from different sensors.< >", "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to capture complex and dynamic interactions between brain regions while performing tasks.

Here, we describe a computational method to identify protein\u2013protein interactions based on in silico protein design.", "Neutrophils derived from induced-differentiated mouse promyleocyte (MPRO) cell lines provide an alternative source of mouse neutrophils for in vitro experiments, substituting for primary mouse neutrophils that are normally obtained by sacrificing mice. One issue with using induced-differentiated MPRO cells (or NEUTs) is that they are usually composed of not only mature neutrophils, but also neutrophil precursors. Here, we report on an assessment of an automated image analysis system to estimate mature neutrophil proportion in giemsa-stained NEUTs, and compare the accuracy with manual cell counting and flow cytometry results.", "We present a framework for identifying disease states by classifying cells in the pathological regions of tissues into different categories. We use conditional random fields (CRF) to incorporate characteristics of cells and their spatial distributions. The efficacy of CRF to model cell-cell feature interactions is demonstrated by using a lung tissue dataset and a synthesized cancer tissue dataset. Comparisons with an independent cell model and a contextual model based on a Markov random field indicate that CRF effectively incorporates features of both cells and their spatial distributions for identification of pathological cells.", "Independent component analysis with reference (ICA-R), is a technique to incorporate prior information about the desired sources as reference signals into the contrast function of ICA so as to form an augmented Lagrangian function under the framework of constrained ICA (cICA). The ICA-R algorithm is constructed by solving the optimization problem via Newton-like learning style. Unfortunately, this algorithm does not find a global optimum once it reaches a local optimum resulting in misconvergence that hinders the capability of ICA-R. To overcome the optimization problems with the previous methods, this paper uses an evolutionary approach to ICA-R that brings the search out of local minima and finds a global optimal solution. Experiments with synthetic signals demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.", "Cytoskeletal proteins function as dynamic and complex components in many aspects of cell physiology and the maintenance of cell structure. However, very little is known about the coordinated system of these proteins. The knowledge of subcellular localization of proteins is crucial for understanding how proteins function within a cell. We present a framework for quantification of cytoskeletal protein localization from high-content microscopic images. Analyses of high content images of cells transfected by cytoskeleton genes involve individual cell segmentation, intensity transformation of subcellular compartments, protein segmentation based on correlation coefficients, and colocalization quantification of proteins in subcellular components. By quantifying the abundance of proteins in different compartments, we generate colocalization profiles that give insights into the functions of different cytoskeletal proteins.", "There has been an increasing interest recently in identifying subcellular proteins from cellular images in order to understachind subcellular activities of cells. However, accuracies of the prediction tend to decrease with the number of protein subcellular localization classes. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a multiple-cell model with a higher-order Markov random fields (MRF) to combine predictions on multiple cells to make inferences on protein localizations of individual cells. The proposed method showed a significant improvement in discrimination of protein subcellular localization patterns over the predictions by single cells. We also introduce structure learning of MRF, which indeed enhanced the predictions especially when the number of cells in the model becomes large.", "Genomic bioinformatics represents a natural convergence of life sciences, computer sciences, and device technologies. The genome is not just a collection of genes working in isolation, rather it encompasses the global and highly coordinated control of information to carry out a range of cellular functions. The genome-wide study is vital for identification of correlated genes and understanding the mechanisms underlying gene transcription and regulation. One of the key challenges lies in the revelation of rich genomic information for the purpose of classification/prediction of cancers and tracking responses to drug therapies.Genomic sequencing and gene expression technologies represent two vital fronts to drug design and disease classification. Even though recent progress has shown that, profile-based methods (ie profile-to-profile comparisons) can yield more sensitive and accurate comparisons of distantly related\u00a0\u2026", "An efficient method for detecting activation on single and multiple epoch functional MRI (fMRI) data based on power spectral density of time-series and hidden Markov model is presented. Conventional methods of analysis of fMRI data are generally based on time-domain correlation analysis concentrating mainly on the multiple epoch data and generally do not provide good results for single epoch data. The main focus of this study is the analysis of single epoch data, constrained by certain experiments such as pain response, sleep, administration of pharmacological agents, which can only have a single or very few stimulus cycles. Further, our method obviates the need to exclusively model the hemodynamic response function and correctly identifies the voxels with delayed activation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting brain activation by using both synthetic and real fMRI data.", "IN recent years, the application of neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary algorithms to problems in the biosciences has increased. These methods, collectively considered \u201ccomputational intelligence\u201d paradigms, offer the advantage of being able to handle nonlinearity in data, large search spaces, and conditions where data classification is continuous rather than discrete. Such complex mappings and imprecise information are common in biological data sets and, thus, computational intelligence methods can assist in producing novel solutions to difficult problems without expert assistance. This special section highlights not only the application of these algorithms to biological problems, but also their possible combinations, such as optimization of neural networks with evolutionary computation. The papers included in this special section provide a broad perspective on possible applications and it is hoped that these papers will serve as the basis for future application and testing of these approaches.Fifty-one papers were submitted to the special section. The guest editors would like to thank all of the authors and reviewers for their great effort in this regard. After an extensive review and revision process, 10 papers were selected for inclusion in this special section due to space limitations. Below, we provide a summary of the papers contained in the special section. The paper \u201cPoisson-Based Self-Organizing Feature Maps and Hierarchical Clustering for Serial Analysis of Gene Expression Data\u201d by Haiying Wang, Huiru Zheng, and Francisco Azuaje provides the results of two new clustering approaches for serial analysis of gene expression\u00a0\u2026", "A time-frequency method based on Cohen\u2019s class of distribution is proposed for analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and to detect activation in the brain regions. The Rihaczek-Margenau distribution among the various distributions of Cohen\u2019s class produces the least amount of cross products and is used here for calculating the spectrum of fMRI time-series. This method also does not suffer from the time and frequency resolution trade-off which is inherent in short-term Fourier transform (STFT). Other than detecting activation, the time-frequency analysis is also capable of providing us with more details about the non-stationarity in fMRI data, which can be used for clustering the data into various brain states. The results of brain activation detection with this techniques are presented here and are compared with other prevalent techniques.", "Diffusion Tensor MR Imaging (DTI) provides non-invasive approach to track white matter (WM) trajectories within human brain in vivo, and thereby facilitates studies of anatomical connectivity between sub-cortical and cortical regions. This paper presents a probabilistic fiber tracking framework, which aims to address the two problems in earlier approaches: first, it does not adopt fractional anisotropy (FA) as the stopping criteria so that the exploration of cortico-cortical connectivity is feasible; secondly, fiber tracking process is regularized so that trajectory with low curvature means high belief of connection between two voxels.", "Knowledge of protein-protein interaction sites is vital to determine proteins\u2019 function and involvement in different pathways. Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been proposed over the recent years to predict protein-protein interface residues, primarily based on single amino acid sequence inputs. We investigate the features of amino acids that can be best used with SVM for predicting residues at protein-protein interfaces. The optimal feature set was derived from investigation into features such as amino acid composition, hydrophobic characters of amino acids, secondary structure propensity of amino acids, accessible surface areas, and evolutionary information generated by PSI-BLAST profiles. Using a backward elimination procedure, amino acid composition, accessible surface areas, and evolutionary information generated by PSI-BLAST profiles gave the best performance. The present approach\u00a0\u2026", "The codon usage patterns of 2,552 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) sequences from 33 primate species, and the consequent subsets of sequences obtained by removing species with most abundant sequences was observed. The correlation between function and species with regards to MHC codon usage patterns was analyzed using cluster analysis and support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that gene function is the major factor, while species is the minor factor correlated to codon usage bias, but their interactions complicate the codon usage pattern. When the weight of the factor of species increases, the accuracy rate of classification dropped accordingly. The factors of gene function and species can be adopted as feature vectors in the field of gene classification and phylogenetic studies respectively. As the input of codon usage to the classifier is independent of sequence length and variance\u00a0\u2026", "We propose methods to extract fuzzy features from fMR time-series in order to detect brain activation. Five discriminating features are automatically extracted from fMRI using a sequence of temporal-sliding-windows. A fuzzy model based on these features is first developed by gradient method training on a set of initial training data and then incrementally updated. The resulting fuzzy activation maps are then combined to provide a measure of strength of activation for each voxel in human brain; a two-way thresholding scheme is introduced to determine actual activated voxels. The method is tested on both synthetic and real fMRI datasets for functional activation detection, illustrating that it is less vulnerable to correlated noise and is able to adapt to different hemodynamic response functions across subjects through incremental learning.", "Prediction of protein subcellular localization from amino acid sequence is an important step towards elucidating the function of a protein. Here, we present an approach for predicting protein subcellular localizations from eukaryotic sequences using Support Vector Machines. Apart from using amino acid compositions, our prediction approach also considers biochemical characteristics of amino acids and their distribution patterns along the primary sequence of the query proteins. Consequently, improved predictive accuracy has been achieved on the Reinhardt and Hubbard\u2019s dataset. For the four subcellular localizations of eukaryotic proteins, the total prediction accuracy obtained using the \u201c leave-one-out\u201d cross-validation test is 88.88%. To the best of our knowledge, our approach obtained by far the best prediction accuracy for mitochondrial proteins, which are notoriously difficult to predict among eukaryotic\u00a0\u2026", "In the spectral analysis of mass spectrometry data, we face the problem of transforming very long time domain FTMS (Fourier transform mass spectrometer) data into the frequency domain of mass spectrum data. It possesses a problem of determining various fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms to be incorporated into the mass spectrometry analysis. In this research, various sequential FFT algorithms were investigated and it was concluded that a composite prime radix FFT was most suitable for the FTMS data analysis.", "We summarize some of the key research areas in brain sciences and neural networks that have recently been or are being worked on by researchers in Singapore. Researchers in Singapore are developing theory of neural networks, notably improved radial basis function networks, fuzzy neural networks, and fast learning neural networks. Applications of neural networks include bioinformatics, multimedia, data mining, and communications. Researchers are also working with neurophysiologists on functional brain imaging and brain disease analysis.", "This paper proposes a novel approach for analysis of brain connectivity shown in functional MRI (fMRI), using graphical models. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is currently used to model neural systems by using partial covariance values, which is only able to affirm or refute functional connectivity of a previously known anatomical model or select the best fit model from a set of a priori models. Our approach is exploratory in the sense that it does not require a priori model such as an anatomical model. The SEM uses covariances which describe only second order behavior of a network while conditional probabilities used in graphical models, in theory, describe the complete behavior of a network. It renders the interactions among brain regions with conditional densities and allows simulation of disconnectivity of neural systems.", "A probabilistic approach combining a hidden Markov model and neural networks is implemented to identify different functional entities in nucleotide sequences. This approach augments the Hidden Markov model probability parameters by using the outputs of neural networks. It is designed to capture the compositional properties of complex genes and thereby achieves low error rates and high correlation coefficient measures. Initial experiments demonstrate that the predictive efficiency of the model is considerably higher than the existing models of gene finding.", "Conference proceedings front matter may contain various advertisements, welcome messages, committee or program information, and other miscellaneous conference information.

The spatial and temporal domain correlations are incorporated using appropriate prior models and the possibility of using the Markov property to incorporate the spatial domain correlations are investigated.", "Present 3-D stereology techniques use fixed grid sampling where the sampling grid of test points is randomly placed in 3-D. In order to increase randomness of sampling, in this paper we propose random grid sampling scheme where grid sections are placed randomly over 2-D cross-sections. A random grid sampler has superior efficiency and accuracy compared with fixed grid sampling. Using MR head scans we demonstrate the use of random grid sampling in volumetry of structures in 3-D biomedical images.", "The emerging scheme (J.C. Rajapakse and F. Kruggel) is used to segment neuroanatomical structures in magnetic resonance (MR) head scans. Emerging is a region growing technique which is guided by the edgeness profile of the image. It is similar to the watershed algorithm (L. Vincent and P. Soille, 1991), but allows splitting of regions in catchment basins and merging at watershed boundaries. Region boundaries in MR head scans are fuzzy and compositions of tissues of some structures render varying intensity patterns. These characteristics and scanner limitations pose difficulties to unsupervised segmentation of MR head scans. We present emerging as a segmentation technique that overcomes these difficulties to produce reasonable segmentations of neuroanatomical structures.", null, "Computational models often overfit on neuroimaging datasets (which are high-dimensional and consist of small sample sizes), resulting in poor inferences such as ungeneralisable biomarkers. One solution is to pool datasets (of similar disorders) from other sites to augment the small dataset, but such efforts have to handle variations introduced by site effects and inconsistent labelling. To overcome these issues, we propose an encoder-decoder-classifier architecture that combines semi-supervised learning with harmonisation of data across sites. The architecture is trained end-to-end via a novel multi-objective loss function. Using the architecture on multi-site fMRI datasets such as ADHD-200 and ABIDE, we obtained significant improvement on classification performance and showed how site-invariant biomarkers were disambiguated from site-specific ones. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting\u00a0\u2026", "Most previous research treats named entity extraction and classification as an end-to-end task. We argue that the two sub-tasks should be addressed separately. Entity extraction lies at the level of syntactic analysis while entity classification lies at the level of semantic analysis. According to Noam Chomsky's \"Syntactic Structures,\" pp. 93-94 (Chomsky 1957), syntax is not appealed to semantics and semantics does not affect syntax. We analyze two benchmark datasets for the characteristics of named entities, finding that uncommon words can distinguish named entities from common text; where uncommon words are the words that hardly appear in common text and they are mainly the proper nouns. Experiments validate that lexical and syntactic features achieve state-of-the-art performance on entity extraction and that semantic features do not further improve the extraction performance, in both of our model and the state-of-the-art baselines. With Chomsky's view, we also explain the failure of joint syntactic and semantic parsings in other works.", "Parcellating the brain into functional homogeneous regions could be achieved by performing clustering on fMRI data. Mathematically, parcellation is about how to construct the affinity matrix between voxels and identify subspaces within. Most previous methods derive the affinity matrix by using Pearson correlation, which is sensitive to noises inherent in fMRI. One recent work uses Sparse Representation to reconstruct the signals of each voxel by a sparse linear combination of other voxels, and the reconstruction coefficients are used as the affinity matrix for parcellation. We extend a popular Sparse Representation method \u2014 Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by incorporating a locality regularization that encourages a voxel to be more represented by nearby voxels, and establish the Local-SSC method. Local-SSC performs comparably to SSC on simulated rs-fMRI data, and outperforms SSC on real fMRI data\u00a0\u2026", "Cellular and tissue engineering is a developing research eld that aims to regenerate tissues and restore  organ functions, which focus on the precise controls of structure and function at cellular resolution via  the extracellular microenvironments (Langer and Vacanti, 1993). Both the top-down and bottom-up  approaches (Ananthanarayanan et\u00a0 al., 2011) that are widely adopted in the eld to construct tissues  require the understanding of cell and tissue responses to biomaterials or tissue-engineered constructs  at dierent levels. Imaging techniques play an important role to serve this purpose by medical imaging modalities at the tissue and organ level in vivo and by microscopic imaging modalities at the cell  level in\u00a0vitro. While the details of these imaging modalities are elaborated in this book, image analysis  methods to interpret the images from these imaging modalities are equally important. e common  approach of\u00a0\u2026", "Scale-space analysis is able to detect activation at various scales from a functional MR brain slice. Though scale space analysis has been used in functional MRI, its use has been limited to periodic block-based experiments. This paper extends scale space analysis to event-related experiments. Furthermore, the method uses higher harmonics of stimulus frequency, which contain considerable energy especially in periodic event-related data. The use of these harmonics results in a chi-square random field of higher degree and improves accuracy in activation detection.", "This paper presents an intensity normalization method for analysis of liver tissue images, acquired using the two-photon microscopy system at different stages of fibrosis. Image informatics methods require precise intensity segmentation for analysis of collagen, vessel and cellular structures. Intensities of the images recorded at different time intervals corresponding to the progression of fibrosis could vary spatially and temporally depending on the experimental conditions. These variations significantly affect the image segmentation process and thus the final image analysis, especially when automatic computer-based methods are used for diagnostic parameters quantification. We propose an adaptive intensity normalization method that facilitates spatial and temporal intensity variations of the images before the segmentation process. The images are first portioned into a tessellation of regions with relatively uniform\u00a0\u2026", "This article describes a workflow for identifying conserved patterns in noncoding regions of vertebrate genomes, with an intention of investigating possible functions of the conserved regions. The annotations of genomes are collected from the Ensembl database. The sequences are then arranged to use for sequence alignment with basic local alignment search tool Z (BLASTZ) [10], which finds gap- free alignments of at least q% identity and I b/s in length. All the conserved noncoding regions identified are stored in a relational database. An user-friendly Web interface provides easy access to conserved regions and related information and visualization capabilities.", "This chapter deals with discovering promoter regions from eukaryotic DNA sequences. The present approach encodes the inputs to the neural networks for the recognition of promoters, using Markov models. The Markov models represent the biological knowledge of the motifs, namely, TATA box and and Inr regions, of the promoter regions. These inputs are then processed by neural networks to extract more complex and distant interactions of bases. The predictions made by neural networks are later combined to vote for the promoter region. The present approach showed promising results in detecting promoter regions and may be extended to extract other signals or motifs from biological sequences.", "We investigate optimal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisition parameters including the number of diffusion encoding directions (K), the number of excitations at each direction (N  e ) and diffusion weighting (b-value). A time efficiency measure is proposed for parameter optimization to achieve the best compromise between the accuracy of estimated fiber tracts and scan time in spin echo single shot echo-planar imaging (EPI). By simulation with four synthetic datasets, we conclude that six encoding directions and one excitation give the highest time efficiency when single image SNR0 measured at b-value=\u2009191.14 mm\u2009\u2212\u20092 s is larger than 32. The optimal number of excitations increases to two when SNR0 is smaller than 32. Further increase of K and N  e  would decrease time efficiency. And the optimal b-value decreases as SNR0\u00a0\u2026", "We present a novel approach to encode inputs to neural networks for the recognition of transcription start sites in RNA polymerase II promoter regions. The approach is based on Markov models that represent TATA-box and Inr transcription binding sites, characterizing a promoter. The Markovian parameters are used as inputs to three neural networks which learn potential distant relationships between the nucleotides at promoter regions. Such an approach allows for incorporating the biological contextual information of the promoter sites into neural network systems and implementing higher-order Markov models of the promoters. Our experiments on a human promoter data set, available at [19], showed an increased correlation coefficient rate of 0.69 on average, which is better than the earlier reported best rate of 0.65 by NNPP 2.1 method.", "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) requires ultra-fast imaging in order to capture the on-going spatio-temporal dynamics of the cognitive task. We make use of correlations in both k-space and time, and thereby reconstruct the time series by acquiring only a fraction of the data, using an improved form of the well-known dynamic imaging technique k-t BLAST (Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique). k-t BLAST (k-tB) works by unwrapping the aliased Fourier conjugate space of k-t ( y-f space). The unwrapping process makes use of an estimate of the true y-f space, obtained by acquiring a blurred unaliased version. In this paper, we propose two changes to the existing algorithm. Firstly, we improve the map estimate using generalized series reconstruction. The second change is to incorporate phase constraints from the training map. The proposed technique is compared with existing k-tB\u00a0\u2026", "Diffusion Tensor (DT) fiber tracking techniques offer significant potential for studying anatomical connectivity of human brain in vivo. And the reliability and accuracy of fiber tracking results depend on the quality of estimated DT which is determined by parameters of image acquisition protocol. The aim of this paper is to investigate what echo-planar image (EPI) acquisition parameters: the number of sensitizing directions K and diffusion weighting b-value gives the best estimation of DT and shorter scan time. We carried out tracking on synthetic dataset that was artificially corrupted by various levels of Gaussian noise to study the effects of K and b-value on fiber tracking results, and to evaluate the quality of estimated DT.

The variability in these surface patterns between individuals is caused by local differences in the rate of angular deformations of cerebral tissues during brain development. It has been reported that age effects of the human brain result in significant changes in the cortical volume (Courchesne et al., 2000). Moreover, the locations of individual convolutions on the brain surface depend on local changes in cortical structure, with sulci occurring in relation to boundaries between cortical architectonic fields. Additionally, the importance of visualizing medical images, especially in 3D, for clinical applications involving the brain, is immense (Linney and Alusi, 1998). Therefore, a method to analyze and visualize age-related variability of surface patterns is useful in neuro-imaging studies to detect various functional disorders and behavioral changes between children and adults (Kolb, 1993). The investigation in this paper presents a new approach based on statistical analysis of curvature changes in deformation vectors of a NURBS surface to compute and visualize the variability associated with surface patterns of the human brain.", "Knowledge of subcellular localisation of proteins is important in determining their function and involvement in different pathways. A wide variety of methods has been proposed over the recent years in order to predict the subcellular localisation of proteins, mainly based on amino acid composition or single sequence inputs. We propose a Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) method for protein subcellular localisation prediction based on N-terminal sorting signals by using the information derived from Amino Acid (AA) index database. The LVQ approach achieved overall prediction accuracies of 84.7% for 2427 eukaryotic protein sequences on Reinhardt and Hubbard dataset and upto 86.8% on the non-plant (eukaryotes) dataset of 2738 sequences from the TargetP website, which are comparable or better than the results of existing prediction methods.", "The Challenge Problem posed by Pevzner et al. showed that special algorithms are needed to detect weak motifs in bio-sequences, where the classical approaches, such as MEME and Gibbs Sampler, fail. Though several algorithms have since been developed to solve the weak motif recognition problem, their focus has been on exact datasets and their performances show poor tolerance to the noisy datasets, i.e., for datasets bearing sequences without any motif instances. We propose a novel approach to find weak motifs that is robust to noise in the datasets. The experiments with synthetic datasets show that our algorithm has less running time and higher accuracy in detecting weak motifs over the existing approaches and is more robust to the presense of noise. The application of the algorithm on some promoter datasets from yeast genomes found previously-proven binding sites.", null, "Previously, sequential equation modelling (SEM) was applied to compute interactions of neural system derived from fMRI, which was understood as confirmatory modelling. In this paper, a data-driven approach with SEM is proposed to explore effective connectivity among brain units. Spatial ICA (independent component analysis) technique is used as an exploratory detection method for activation regions, and is combined with an automated best model search to build a best-fitted path model. This work was demonstrated with the visual-task fMRI data. We conclude by suggesting that this exploratory method will give a more dynamic model for determining the interactions among functional brain network, especially in the event of brain abnormalities.", "A novel technique based on curvature changes in non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) deformations to detect profound variations in age and gender-related surface patterns of the human brain is presented. Initially, a deformable NURBS surface is used to segment the brains from normalized magnetic resonance (MR) images. The NURBS surface of a template brain is then deformed until it conforms to a representative brain. Significant variations in surface segments during deformations among different groups are captured by statistical analysis of curvature changes at deformed points. The results indicate a decrease in surface variability during brain development (from 4-18 years) in normal males and also significant variability in surface patterns on the frontal lobe between male and female adults.", "A fuzzy neural approach is presented to segment subcortical structures, such as amygdala, caudate, putamen, hippocampus and thalamus, automatically, from MR head scans. Both the position and intensity features of these structures are used by fuzzy neural network and clustering techniques, incorporating a priori knowledge from neuroanatomy. Information of tissue classes and the positions of voxels are fused together to make decisions on them belonging to specific anatomical structures of the brain. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and use of the technique.", "We propose a novel approach to predict protein secondary structure by combining different types of GOR (Garnier, Osguthorpe, and Robson) classifiers with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The new prediction scheme achieves an accuracy of 69.3% when using the sevenfold cross validation on a database of 126 nonhomologous globular proteins. Applying the method to multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins significantly increases the prediction accuracy to 72.1%. We show that it is possible to obtain a higher accuracy with combined classifiers than GOR classifiers or Support Vector Machines alone, in protein secondary structure prediction.", "Frequency domain analysis of event-related and block-design functional MR imaging (fMRI) time-series is presented, assuming a linear model of fMR response.

The usefulness and limitations of the frequency domain analysis of fMRI time-series are highlighted.", "Extracting the human brain from magnetic resonance head scans is difficult because of its highly convoluted and nonuniform geometry. A technique based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) and energy minimising deformable models to extract the brain surface accurately from MR head scans is presented. The weighting parameter that comes with the NURBS definition is explored to attract the surface into the regions showing high curvature. The weight at each control point is adjusted automatically according to the curvature properties of the evolving surface. This process facilitates a deformable surface with increased local flexibility that adapts to complex geometrical features of the brain. The results show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the correct brain surface with a higher accuracy than the existing techniques.", "Many magnetic resonance (MR) brain image segmentation techniques assume that the image is formed by classes of biological tissue having constant intensities. However, the presence of inhomogeneities have proven that they tend not to be so. Earlier techniques that tried to cater to inhomogeneities, specifically the bias field, have shown to require pre-setting of parameters or use prohibitive amount of computational resources. In the present approach, a two-dimensional statistical clustering technique based on Bayesian theory is used to model class intensities. To cater for inhomogeneities, class intensities are modeled as polynomials rather than just constant values.

By converting a given biomolecular sequence into an optimal or near optimal search problem in the solution space, the genetic algorithm efficiently and robustly finds the solution for the multiple sequence alignment. Our approach is different from previous similar approaches in the sense that it allows pairwise alignment in each generation and does not utilize dynamic programming at any stage.

Experiments on an ensemble of MR head scans show promise of the current approach.", "A technique based on statistical and curvature analyse of non-uniform rational b-splines (NURBS) deformations to detect and visualize the profound variations in surface patterns during the evolution of the human brain from childhood to adolescent is presented. Initially, a deformable NURBS surface is used to segment the brains from normalized magnetic resonance (MR) images. The NURBS surface of a template brain is then deformed until it conforms to a representative subject image. Variability in significant deformations between the subjects is captured by regression analysis of the deformed vectors while the curvature Laplacian is computed to detect the variations in sulci and gyri patterns. We also examine the variability between different age ranges by separating the subjects into 4 groups based on their ages.

Results from synthetic and real fMR images obtained in memory tasks are shown and elaborated.", "This paper explores spatial decomposition of functional MR images by several extended blind source separation (BSS) techniques in order to detect the brain activation. The four techniques are based on different criteria and assumptions like mutual statistical independence or non-Gaussianity of sub-band sources, spatial linear predictability, spatial-temporal decorrelation and non-stationarity of the colored sources. We conclude that the detection of activation in fMRI experiments is possible in many cases by exploiting these characteristics of the sources extracted from raw data.", "Hemodynamic parameter maps (HPMs) depict values of parameters of hemodynamic response, namely, gain, lag, and dispersion, in response to neuronal activation. Large intensity values of any of the HPMs indicate greater likelihoods of brain activation. We apply the probabilistic data fusion equation to combine three HPMs. The statistical map of the fused probability map derived from HPMs is compared with statistical parameter mapping (SPM) in a visual experiment. The statistical hemodynamic parameter map (SHPM) gives better contrast to distinguish activated voxels from nonactivated voxels.", "One of the reasons for the power in human vision system is its ability to combine information from different visual processes. Fusion of visual information of multiple visual sensors can resolve some of the unsolved complex computer vision problems. The thesis investigates the problem of information fusion in visual reconstruction, and visual recognition.

A two-stage support vector regression (SVR) approach is proposed to predict real values of ASA from the position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) generated from PSI-BLAST profiles. By adding SVR as the second stage to capture the influences on the ASA value of a residue by those of its neighbors, the two-stage SVR approach achieves improvements of mean absolute errors up to 3.3%, and correlation coefficients of 0.66, 0.68, and 0.67 on the Manesh dataset of 215 proteins, the Barton dataset of 502 nonhomologous proteins, and the Carugo dataset of 338 proteins, respectively, which are better than the scores published earlier on these datasets. A web server for protein ASA prediction by using a two-stage SVR method has been developed and is available (http://birc. ntu. edu. sg/~ pas0186457/asa. html).Contact: asjagath@ ntu. edu. sg", "Hotspot detection using thermal imaging has recently become essential in several industrial applications, such as security applications that require identification of suspicious activities or intruders by detecting hotspots generated by human body heat, health applications such as screening of individuals in quarantine environments for onset of fever, and equipment monitoring applications where ensuring smooth operation and preventing potential malfunction by assessing temperature distribution in equipment is important. Hotspot detection is of utmost importance in industrial safety where equipment can develop anomalies. Hotspots are early indicators of such anomalies. We address the problem of hotspot detection in thermal images by proposing a self-supervised learning approach.

Entities have different forms in different linguistic tasks and researchers treat those different forms as different concepts. In this paper, we are curious to know whether there are some common characteristics that connect those different forms of entities. Specifically, we investigate the underlying distributions of entities from different types and different languages, trying to figure out some common characteristics behind those diverse entities. After analyzing twelve datasets about different types of entities and eighteen datasets about entities in different languages, we find that while these entities are dramatically diverse from each other in many aspects, their length-frequencies can be well characterized by a family of Marshall\u2013Olkin power-law (MOPL) distributions.

We propose a novel domain adaptation technique that embodies a multitask framework with SER as the primary task, and contrastive learning and information maximisation loss as auxiliary tasks, underpinned by fine-tuning of transformers pre-trained on large language models. Empirical results obtained through experiments on well-established datasets like IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV, illustrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in SER within cross-corpus scenarios.", "In recent years, deep learning models have been applied to neuroimaging data for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images provide structural and functional information about the brain, respectively. Combining these features leads to improved performance than using a single modality alone in building predictive models for AD diagnosis. However, current multi-modal approaches in deep learning, based on sMRI and PET, are mostly limited to convolutional neural networks, which do not facilitate integration of both image and phenotypic information of subjects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNN) that are designed to deal with problems in non-Euclidean domains. In this study, we demonstrate how brain networks are created from sMRI or PET images and can be used in a population graph framework\u00a0\u2026", "With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of multi-omics data have been collected for precision medicine. There exists multiple graph-based prior biological knowledge about omics data, such as gene-gene interaction networks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in introducing graph neural networks (GNNs) into multi-omics learning. However, existing methods have not fully exploited these graphical priors since none have been able to integrate knowledge from multiple sources simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-omics data analysis framework by incorporating multiple prior knowledge into graph neural network (MPK-GNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce multiple prior graphs into multi-omics data analysis. Specifically, the proposed method contains four parts: (1) a feature-level learning module to aggregate information from prior\u00a0\u2026", "Motivation While it has been well established that drugs affect and help patients differently, personalized drug response predictions remain challenging. Solutions based on single omics measurements have been proposed, and networks provide means to incorporate molecular interactions into reasoning. However, how to integrate the wealth of information contained in multiple omics layers still poses a complex problem. Results We present DrDimont, Drug response prediction from Differential analysis of multi-omics networks. It allows for comparative conclusions between two conditions and translates them into differential drug response predictions. DrDimont focuses on molecular interactions.

CAL is a dual cascaded network architecture where the output of the transformation network is fed as input to the classification network. Transformation network transforms original speech emotion to speaker-invariant emotion data by implementing an AL strategy with an encoder-decoder architecture. The classification network predicts the emotion from the speaker-invariant emotion data (output of the transformation network). We argue that the speaker-invariant emotion data realized by transformation network has less variation than the original speech emotion data and therefore are conducive for SIER as it improve generalization capability.

To this end, DAL jointly minimize triplet and cross-entropy losses with gradient reversal strategy for speaker independent emotion recognition (SIER).

Over the last decade, the research community has gathered abundant and diverse measurements of multiple layers of molecular data in thousands of tumors.", "Biological entities such as genes, promoters, mRNA, Background: metabolites or proteins do not act alone, but in concert in their network context. Modules, ie, groups of nodes with similar topological properties in these networks characterize important biological functions of the underlying biomolecular system. Edges in such molecular networks represent regulatory and physical interactions, and comparing them between conditions provides valuable information on differential molecular mechanisms. However, biological data is inherently noisy and network reduction techniques can propagate errors particularly to the level of edges. We aim to improve the analysis of networks of biological molecules by deriving modules together with edge relevance estimations that are based on global network characteristics.", "This paper presents a discovery that the length of the entities in various datasets follows a family of scale-free power law distributions. The concept of entity here broadly includes the named entity, entity mention, time expression, aspect term, and domain-specific entity that are well investigated in natural language processing and related areas. The entity length denotes the number of words in an entity. The power law distributions in entity length possess the scale-free property and have well-defined means and finite variances. We explain the phenomenon of power laws in entity length by the principle of least effort in communication and the preferential mechanism.", "Background One of the main current challenges in computational biology is to make sense of the huge amounts of multidimensional experimental data that are being produced. For instance, large cohorts of patients are often screened using different high-throughput technologies, effectively producing multiple patient-specific molecular profiles for hundreds or thousands of patients. Results We propose and implement a network-based method that integrates such patient omics data into Patient Similarity Networks. Topological features derived from these networks were then used to predict relevant clinical features. As part of the 2017 CAMDA challenge, we have successfully applied this strategy to a neuroblastoma dataset, consisting of genomic and transcriptomic data. In particular, we observe that models built on our network-based approach perform at least as well as state of the art models. We furthermore explore the effectiveness of various topological features and observe, for instance, that redundant centrality metrics can be combined to build more powerful models. Conclusion We demonstrate that the networks inferred from omics data contain clinically relevant information and that patient clinical outcomes can be predicted using only network topological data.", "Functional similarity between genes is widely used in many bioinformatics applications including detecting molecular pathways, finding co-expressed genes, predicting protein-protein interactions, and prioritization of candidate genes. Methods evaluating functional similarity of genes are mostly based on semantic similarity of gene ontology (GO) terms. Though there are hundreds of functional similarity measures available in the literature, none of them considers the enrichment of the GO terms by the querying gene pair. We propose a novel method to incorporate GO enrichment into the existing functional similarity measures. Our experiments show that the inclusion of gene enrichment significantly improves the performance of 44 widely used functional similarity measures, especially in the prediction of sequence homologies, gene expression correlations, and protein-protein interactions.Software availabilityThe software (python code) and all the benchmark datasets evaluation (R script) are available at https://gitlab.com/liuwt/EnrichFunSim.", "The human brain is organized into functionally specialized subnetworks, referred to as modules. Many methods have been employed to detect modules in the brain network, e.g. Newman's modularity and the Louvain method for community detection. However, these methods suffer from a resolution limit, and the detected number of modules is often inaccurate. In this work, we adopt Eigen Value Decomposition (EVD) on the signless Laplacian of the functional connectivity matrix to detect modules. This method is unaffected by the resolution-limit, and could identify the number of clusters more accurately. We tested the EVD method on two datasets. On a cat's cortex connectome, 5 modules were identified, agreeing with anatomical knowledge while Newman's and Louvain methods performed unstably. On the 872 fMRI scans in the Human Connectome Project, 9 modules were identified in the functional brain network\u00a0\u2026", "In functional MRI (fMRI), the noise is often considered to have a fixed model of temporal autocorrelation. However, the correlation structure of brain voxels is generally unknown and varies due to the regional effects of neurogenic noises and pulsatile effects. In this paper, we apply mixed spectrum analysis to separate the discrete (task-related) spectrum and continuous (noise-related) spectrum of fMRI signals in task-related experiments, without assuming a fixed model for temporal autocorrelation. The purpose is to improve the detection of activation in periodic task-related fMRI data. We have also modified the M spectral estimator (MSPEC) method, generally applied on individual time-series, in order to incorporate contextual information in fRMI data.

As a result, bioinformatics involving its two main disciplines, namely, the life sciences and the computational sciences, is fast becoming a very promising multidisciplinary field of research. With the ever-increasing application of large-scale high-throughput technologies, such as gene or protein microarrays and mass spectrometry, and massive parallel sequencing the enormous body of information is growing rapidly. Bioinformaticians are posed with a large number of difficult problems to solve, arising not only due to the complexities in acquiring the molecular information but also due to the size and nature of the generated data sets and/or the limitations of the algorithms required for analyzing these data. The recent advancements in computational and informationtheoretic techniques are enabling us to conduct various in silico testing and screening of many lab-based experiments before these are actually performed in vitro or in vivo. These in silico investigations are providing new insights for interpreting and establishing new directions for a deeper understanding. Among the various advanced computational methods currently being applied to such studies, the pattern recognition techniques are mostly found to be at the core of the whole discovery process for apprehending the underlying biological knowledge.

However, classical T-score uses all the training samples but for both biological and computational reasons, selection of relevant samples for training is an important step in classification. Using a modified logistic regression approach, we propose a sample selection criterion based on T-score and develop a backward elimination approach for gene selection. The method is more stable and computationally less costly compared to support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) methods.", "Background Infections caused by dengue virus are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Factors that control transition from mild forms of disease such as dengue fever (DF) to more life-threatening forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are poorly understood. Consequently, there are no reliable methods currently available for early triage of DHF patients resulting in significant over-hospitalization. Methodology/Principal FindingsWe have systematically examined the proteome, cytokines and inflammatory markers in sera from 62 adult dengue patients (44 DF; 18 DHF) with primary DENV infection, at three different times of infection representing the early febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages. Using fluorescent bioplex assays, we measured 27 cytokines in these serum samples. Additionally, we used multiple mass spectrometry methods for iTRAQ-based comparative analysis of serum proteome as well as measurements of protein adducts- 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine as surrogate measures of free radical activity. Using multiple methods such as OPLS, MRMR and MSVM-RFE for multivariate feature selection and classification, we report molecular markers that allow prediction of primary DHF with sensitivity and specificity of >80%. Conclusions/Significance  This report constitutes a comprehensive analysis of molecular signatures of dengue disease progression and will help unravel mechanisms of dengue disease progression. Our analysis resulted in the identification of markers that may be useful for early prediction of DHF during the febrile phase.

Particularly, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is probably the most important technique that noninvasively studies brain functions under numerous cognitive and behavioral tasks. Functional brain studies acquire a time series of brain scans while the subject is alternatively performing an experimental task and a baseline task (so that the input stimulus to the brain takes the form of an on-off box-car pattern). Brain regions of interest are then detected through measuring the oxygenation level variations in blood vessels near the neurons activated by the input stimulus, ie, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The detection of brain activation provides functional maps exhibiting which brain regions correspond to specific sensory or cognitive tasks. In fMRI experiments, the BOLD signal (or the hemodynamic response) changes resulted from neural activities follow the pattern of input stimulus, but are usually contaminated by high-level noises (Bandettini et al., 1993). Hence, it is important to develop analysis methods that can robustly detect activated brain regions from the noisy fMRI time series.", "Though a plethora of techniques have been used to build gene regulatory networks (GRN) from time-series gene expression data, stabilities of such techniques have not been studied. This paper investigates the stability of GRN built using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) by synthetically generating gene expression time-series. Assuming scale-free topologies, sample datasets are drawn from DBN to evaluate the stability of estimating the structure of GRN. Our experiments indicate although high accuracy can be achieved with equal number of time points to the number of genes in the network, the presence of large numbers of false positives and false negatives deteriorate the stability of building GRN. The stability could be improved by gathering gene expression at more time points. Interestingly, large networks required less number of time points (normalized to the size of the network) than small networks\u00a0\u2026", null, "A new method is proposed for joint tracking of cell morphology and motion from 3D temporal cellular images.

Although numerous computational techniques have been applied to predict protein secondary structure (PSS), only limited studies have dealt with discovery of logic rules underlying the prediction itself. Such rules offer interesting links between the prediction model and the underlying biology. In addition, they enhance interpretability of PSS prediction by providing a degree of transparency to the predicting model usually regarded as a black-box. In this paper, we explore the generation and use of C 4.5 decision trees to extract relevant rules from PSS predictions modeled with two-stage support vector machines (TS-SVM). Our approach has produced sizable sets of comprehensible, and often interpretable, rules underlying the PSS predictions.

Five discriminating features are automatically extracted from fMRI data by a sequence of temporal-sliding-windows. A fuzzy model based on these features is first derived by a gradient method on a set of initial training data and then incrementally enhanced. The resulting fuzzy activation maps of all subjects are then combined to provide a measure of strength of activation of each voxel, based on the group of subjects. A two-way thresholding scheme is introduced to determine true activated voxels. The method is tested on both synthetic and real fMRI datasets. The method is less vulnerable to correlated noise and able to capture the key activation from a group of subjects by adapting to hemodynamic variability across subjects.", "Pseudogenes are formed by either gene duplication or retro transposition and yet unknown to express any RNA or produce any protein, which may be due to some defects in their structure. Because of the non-functional nature, pseudogenes are considered important resources in the study of evolutionary history and phylogenetic comparison of genomes. Psuedogenes whose structure is similar to the normal genes, pose problems in gene annotation and interfere with PCR or hybridization experiments. In this paper, we compare structural and functional properties of pseudogenes of human and mouse. It was found that 3,277 pseudogenes of humans which had conserved regions in pseudogenes of mouse shared the same number of chromosomes. Human and mouse pseudogenes are very similar to each other based on the effective codon usage and fraction of codons having guanine or cytosine at the third\u00a0\u2026", null, "Recent years have witnessed the phenomenal growth of bioinformatics and medical informatics... exciting fields devoted to the interpretation and analysis of biological and medical data using computational techniques.

The variability in these surface patterns between individuals is caused by local differences in the rate of angular deformations of cerebral tissues during brain development. It has been reported that age effects of the human brain result in significant changes in the cortical volume (Courchesne et al., 2000). Moreover, the locations of individual convolutions on the brain surface depend on local changes in cortical structure, with sulci occurring in relation to boundaries between cortical architectonic fields. Additionally, the importance of visualizing medical images, especially in 3D, for clinical applications involving the brain, is immense (Linney and Alusi, 1998).

For the prior model, a multi-level logistic model (MLL) is employed. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is taken by optimizing the probability of a voxel being a particular tissue type given the corresponding probabilities from both images and the image prior probability.

It is important to align the fMR images in the time-series before time-dependent analyses. This registration method aligns the boundaries of brains extracted from the functional images. It uses a genetic algorithm to minimize the distance function obtained from the chamfer distance transform. The global search nature of genetic algorithm makes this method robust to the presence of local minima.", null, null, "Fixed-grid 3D stereology uses a randomly placed 3D parallelepiped grid for sampling image space to generate test points. Though this is an efficient technique, the use of the fixed-grid introduces errors in the final estimate. Random-grid 3D stereology was introduced to improve the accuracy while maintaining a high efficiency (J.C. Rajapakse and K.K. Lee, 1998). The authors apply random-grid 3D stereology for volumetry of human brain and ventricles in MR head scans. They demonstrate superior efficiency and accuracy of random-grid stereology compared to fixed-grid stereology when applied to MR head scans. Also, the effects of grid sizes and the optimal directions of sectioning on volume estimates of the brain and ventricles are investigated.", "Sensory or cognitive stimuli in functional MRI (fMRI) experiments activate neuronal populations in specific areas of the brain. Neuronal events in activated brain regions cause changes of blood flow and blood oxygenation level. FMRI signals are sensitive to hemodynamic events ensuing neuronal activation in the brain. The authors use a neural network to model neuronal-vascular coupling of human brain with images obtained in fMRI experiments. The nonlinear mappings modeled by training a network were used to approximate time series acquired in language comprehension and visual experiments. The models of neuronal-vascular coupling realized using the neural network were better than those rendered by a linear system model.", "Performance Comparison of ICA Neural Networks Separating Audio Signals - Kent Academic \nRepository Skip to main content Login Admin Dashboards Help Simple search | Advanced \nsearch Home Browse Latest additions Policies Accessibility Statement Performance Comparison \nof ICA Neural Networks Separating Audio Signals Rajapakse, J., Loh, V., McLoughlin, Ian \nVince (1999) Performance Comparison of ICA Neural Networks Separating Audio Signals. \nIn: , International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing. . p. 4. \nIeee (The full text of this publication is not currently available from this repository.

The transient and habituated neuronal activities are modeled with expo-nential functions and vascular coupling with Gaussian func-tion. An algorithm to estimate model parameters from fMRI time-series is proposed and its accuracy is demonstrated with simulated time-series. This paper highlights the potential ap-plication of fMRI for in vivo study of neuronal populations in human brain activations at a macroscopic level.An application of the hemodynamic model to slow fMRI data has been presented and validated elsewhere (Rajapakse et al., 1997) for an ensemble of visual, motor and word-recognition experiments on healthy adults between ages 20-30.

MRI and CT are somewhat dissimilar but complementary imaging technologies. While CT provides excellent information regarding internal bony structures, MRI has proven to be superior in the production of high contrast images of soft tissue. The integration of these two modalities will ameliorate solutions to problems which require highly accurate mappings of anatomical features. PET imagery presents an accurate view of physiological function but little anatomical information. The ability to integrate quantitative information from these complementary modalities will result in improved medical analysis and subsequent improvements in patient care. We consider the problem of multimodality data fusion as an extension of regularization theory. Directionally controlled continuity stabilizers are utilized in the reconstruction process.

Many positive results have indicated that machine learning methods are useful for solving complex biomedical problems too difficult to solve by experts. Traditionally, researchers do biomedical research by using their knowledge and intelligence, performing experiments by hands and eyes, and processing data by basic statistical and mathematical tools. Due to huge amounts of biological data and a very large number of possible combinations and permutations of various biological sequences, the conventional human intelligence-based methods cannot work effectively and efficiently. So artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning can play a critical role in complex biomedical applications. Experts from different domains have contributed chapters to this book, which feature novel machine learning methods\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents photon reassignment method for 3D visualization of biological tissues utilizing structured light wide-field microscopic imaging system. The method provides the capability to image deeper into biological tissue by reassigning fluorescence photons generated from off-focal plane excitation improving in-focus signal strength. Existing structured light illumination based methods allowing wide-field visualization of the focal plane while rejecting out-of-focus background \u201chaze\u201d. While these methods are able to improve image contrast, the loss of out-of-focal plane photons limits the final image signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). Additionally, if the contrast of the projected grid is low this reduces the modulation and provides the weaker sectioning capability and as a result reduces the photons of the reconstructed optically sectioned image. The proposed method seeks to better utilize the lost photons by using the \u2018prior knowledge\u2019about the optical transfer function of the structured light illumination. By utilizing a maximum likelihood approach, the most likely fluorophores distribution in 3D can be identified that will produce the observed image stacks under structured and uniform illumination using an iterative maximization algorithm. The proposed approach is first validated with the simulation data and then it further applied for experimentally recorded data of tissue sample.", "This paper focuses on distributed fault recovery in agent-based systems by providing help for faulty members. In the'present\u00e9d method, if one faulty agent requests forhelp or agents are informed of fault in one of their teammates, they \ufb01rst decide if they are able to help or not. In the case that they are able to help and several help requests exist, helper agents specify a sequence of help actions through another distributed decision-making phase. The introduced fault clearing method is totally distributed in the sense that each helper agent makes its decisions by itself and no central or special agent exists in the system. In fact, the decision'making process and the required information are designed such that the agents cooperate implicitly to prevent the system performance loss.

Host response at early stage after influenza virus infection is indicative of the pathological outcome. The suppression of proinflammatory and immune-related gene expressions for specific period of time early after infection could be an essential mechanism to prevent aberrant immune response. 2. Molecular events, which occur when alveolitis and bronchitis are still minimal, can be used to propose gene expression signatures of low and high virulent influenza infection.", "CONCLUSIONS1. Influenza virus is able to infect NEUT; however, the infection is abortive: some viral proteins are synthesized but new progeny are not formed. 2. IF staining suggested that M2 protein of influenza virus might not be synthesized and this may contribute to the failure of virus replication.", "In general, small-sized networks, even though they show good generalization performance, tend to fail to learn the training data within a given error bound, whereas largesized networks learn easily the training data but yield poor generalization. In this paper, a pruning algorithm of neural networks using impact factor regularization is described to train network without overfitting and to achieve a smallsized network. In order to achieve this goal, an automatic determination method of the regularization parameter and an extended Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm are developed as learning algorithms of neural networks. We tested the proposed method on four regression problems and the simulation results showed our algorithm is effective in regression.", "In the post-genomic era, a holistic understanding of biological systems and processes, in all their complexity, is critical in comprehending nature\u2019s choreography of life.

We studied the perceptional evaluation of this universal display and addressed specially its role in mediating particular emotions. This was done by investigating how human subjects (n= 210; age: 22-30 years) judged different sets of auditory stimuli; ie different sentences presented in whispered or normally spoken language (control). In addition, we varied the quality of emotions encoded in the stimuli and tested also effects of signal transmission via telephone. Judgements were extracted from audiovisual recordings and from selfreport data collected after each trial. Data analyses revealed that the decoding of emotions was almost equally good for whispered and spoken stimuli, and also not markedly impaired when filtered by a phone. Often, however, judgements were affected by social prejudice which could result in bimodal distributions of ratings\u00a0\u2026", "EXAMPLE: Application of biologically and linguistically inspired computational paradigms such as neural networks, evolutionary computation, and fuzzy systems and their hybridizations to problems in computational biology and bioinformatics have increased in recent years.

Most techniques perform the detection of activation in spatial and tempor al domains separately. Simultaneous analysis is ideal for analyzing the fMRI images as they account for the information distributed between both domains. Such simultaneous analysis of fMRI is referred to as spatiotemporal analysis. Benali et. al.[1] have introduced a spatiotemporal technique using the fixed effect model as an extension to principal component analysis (PCA). Distinguishing feature in this technique is the ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal domain prior knowledge into the modeling approach by incorporating into the covariance structure. However, this technique is only applicable to input stimulus having equal durations of ON and OFF states (symmetric experiments).
