of base stations remains a major threat to the network lifetime. The main reason is that the sensor nodes located near a base station have to relay data for a large part of the network and thus deplete their batteries very quickly. The solution we propose in this paper suggests that the base station be mobile; in this way, the nodes located close to it change over time. Data collection protocols can then be optimized by taking both base station mobility and multi-hop routing into account. We first study the former, and conclude that the best mobility strategy consists in following the periphery of the network (we assume that the sensors are deployed within a circle). We then consider jointly mobility and routing algorithms in this case, and show that a better\u00a0\u2026", "Road safety, traffic management, and driver convenience continue to improve, in large part thanks to appropriate usage of information technology. But this evolution has deep implications for security and privacy, which the research community has overlooked so far.", "As a component of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) and one of the concrete applications of mobile ad hoc networks, inter-vehicle communication (IVC) has attracted research attention from both academia and industry of, notably, US, EU, and Japan. The most important feature of IVC is its ability to extend the horizon of drivers and on-board devices (e.g., radar or sensors) and, thus, to improve road traffic safety and efficiency. This chapter surveys IVC with respect to key enabling technologies ranging from physical radio frequency to group communication primitives and security issues. The mobility models used to evaluate the feasibility of these technologies are also briefly described. We focus on the discussion of various MAC protocols that seem to be indispensable components in the network protocol stack of IVC.

However, little work is done to apply CS to multihop networking scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the application of CS to data collection in wireless sensor networks, and we aim at minimizing the network energy consumption through joint routing and compressed aggregation. We first characterize the optimal solution to this optimization problem, then we prove its NP-completeness. We further propose a mixed-integer programming formulation along with a greedy heuristic, from which both the optimal (for small scale problems) and the near-optimal (for large scale problems) aggregation trees are obtained. Our results validate the efficacy of the greedy heuristics, as well as the great improvement in energy efficiency through our joint routing and aggregation scheme.", "Improving network lifetime is a fundamental challenge of wireless sensor networks. One possible solution consists in making use of mobile sinks. Whereas theoretical analysis shows that this approach does indeed benefit network lifetime, practical routing protocols that support sink mobility are still missing. In this paper, in line with our previous efforts, we investigate the approach that makes use of a mobile sink for balancing the traffic load and in turn improving network lifetime. We engineer a routing protocol, MobiRoute, that effectively supports sink mobility. Through intensive simulations in TOSSIM with a mobile sink and an implementation of MobiRoute, we prove the feasibility of the mobile sink approach by demonstrating the improved network lifetime in several deployment scenarios.", "Traditionally, reliable multicast protocols are deterministic in nature. It is precisely this determinism that tends to become their limiting factor when aiming at reliability and scalability, particularly in highly dynamic networks, e.g., ad hoc networks. As probabilistic protocols, gossip-based multicast protocols, recently (re-)discovered in wired networks, appear to be a viable means to \"fight fire with fire\" by exploiting the nondeterministic nature of ad hoc networks. We present a protocol that is designed to meet a more practical specification of probabilistic reliability; this gossip-based multicast protocol, called route driven gossip (RDG), can be deployed on any basic on-demand routing protocol. RDG is custom-tailored to ad hoc networks, achieving a high level of reliability without relying on any inherent multicast primitive. We illustrate our RDG protocol by layering it on top of the \"bare\" DSR protocol. We prove the reliability\u00a0\u2026", "The longevity of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a major issue that impacts the application of such networks. While communication protocols are striving to save energy by acting on sensor nodes, recent results show that network lifetime can be prolonged by further involving sink mobility. As most proposals give their evidence of lifetime improvement through either (small-scale) field tests or numerical simulations on rather arbitrary cases, a theoretical understanding of the reason for this improvement and the tractability of the joint optimization problem is still missing. In this paper, we build a framework for investigating the joint sink mobility and routing problem by constraining the sink to a finite number of locations. We formally prove the NP-hardness of the problem. We also investigate the induced subproblems. In particular, we develop an efficient primal-dual algorithm to solve the subproblem involving a single\u00a0\u2026", "Although compressed sensing (CS) has been envisioned as a useful technique to improve the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is still not very clear how exactly it will be applied and how big the improvements will be. In this paper, we propose two different ways (plain-CS and hybrid-CS) of applying CS to WSNs at the networking layer, in the form of a particular data aggregation mechanism. We formulate three flow-based optimization problems to compute the throughput of the non-CS, plain-CS, and hybrid-CS schemes. We provide the exact solution to the first problem corresponding to the non-CS case and lower bounds for the cases with CS. Our preliminary numerical results are only for a low-power regime. They illustrate two crucial insights: first, applying CS naively may not bring any improvement, and secondly, our hybrid-CS can achieve significant improvement in throughput.", "Although duty-cycling has long been a critical mechanism for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks, it is only recently that research efforts have been put to design data communication protocols that perform efficiently in duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (DC-WSNs). In this article, we survey these research problems, aiming at revealing insights into the following three key questions: what are the meaningful (algorithm design) problems for DC-WSNs, which problems have been studied and which have not, and what are the essential techniques behind the existing solutions? All these insights may serve as motivations and inspirations for further developments in this field.", "We focus on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that perform data collection with the objective of obtaining the whole dataset at the sink (as opposed to a function of the dataset). In this case, energy-efficient data collection requires the use of data aggregation. Whereas many data aggregation schemes have been investigated, they either compromise the fidelity of the recovered data or require complicated in-network compressions. In this paper, we propose a novel data aggregation scheme that exploits compressed sensing (CS) to achieve both recovery fidelity and energy efficiency in WSNs with arbitrary topology. We make use of diffusion wavelets to find a sparse basis that characterizes the spatial (and temporal) correlations well on arbitrary WSNs, which enables straightforward CS-based data aggregation as well as high-fidelity data recovery at the sink.

For this, we first develop efficient and exact computational tools using column generation with greedy pricing that allow us to compute exact solutions for networks significantly larger than what has been possible so far. We also develop very fast approximations that compute nearly optimal solutions for even larger cases. Finally, we adapt our tools to the case of proportional fairness and show that the engineering insights are very similar.", "Reliable storage of data with concurrent read/write accesses (or query/update) is an ever recurring issue in distributed settings. In mobile ad hoc networks, the problem becomes even more challenging due to highly dynamic and unpredictable topology changes. It is precisely this unpredictability that makes probabilistic protocols very appealing for such environments. Inspired by the principles of probabilistic quorum systems, we present a Probabilistic quorum system for ad hoc networks Pan), a collection of protocols for the reliable storage of data in mobile ad hoc networks. Our system behaves in a predictable way due to the gossip-based diffusion mechanism applied for quorum accesses, and the protocol overhead is reduced by adopting an asymmetric quorum construction.

The mobile users will participate in a crowdsensing platform if they can receive a satisfactory reward. In this paper, to effectively and efficiently recruit a sufficient number of mobile users, i.e., participants, we investigate an optimal incentive mechanism of a crowdsensing service provider. We apply a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze the participation level of the mobile users and the optimal incentive mechanism of the crowdsensing service provider using backward induction. In order to motivate the participants, the incentive mechanism is designed by taking into account the social network effects from the underlying mobile social domain.

In this paper, we first report our field studies with GMI, as well as experiment results aiming to explain our unsatisfactory GMI experience. Then motivated by the obtained insights, we propose GROPING as a self-contained indoor navigation system independent of any infrastructural support. GROPING relies on geomagnetic fingerprints that are far more stable than WiFi fingerprints, and it exploits crowdsensing to construct floor maps rather than expecting individual venues to supply digitized maps. Based on our experiments with 20 participants in various floors of a big shopping mall, GROPING is able to deliver a sufficient accuracy for localization and thus provides\u00a0\u2026", "Internet media content delivery started to emerge roughly a decade ago, and it has subsequently had a major impact on network traffic and usage. Although traditional client-server systems were used initially for delivering media content, researchers and practitioners soon realized that peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, due to their self-scaling properties, had the potential to improve scalability compared with traditional client-server architectures. Consequently, various P2P media streaming systems have been deployed successfully, and corresponding theoretical investigations have been performed on such systems. The rapid developments in this field raise the need for up-to-date literature surveys to summarize them. In recent years, numerous technological discoveries have been achieved. The focus of this report is to survey and discuss these new findings, which include new technological developments, as well as\u00a0\u2026", "We present MaWi - a smart phone based scalable indoor localization system. Central to MaWi is a novel framework combining two self-contained but complementary localization techniques: Wi-Fi and Ambient Magnetic Field. Combining the two techniques, MaWi not only achieves a high localization accuracy, but also effectively reduces human labor in building fingerprint databases: to avoid war-driving, MaWi is designed to work with low quality fingerprint databases that can be efficiently built by only one person. Our experiments demonstrate that MaWi, with a fingerprint database as scarce as one data sample at each spot, outperforms the state-of-the-art proposals working on a richer fingerprint database.", "Securing ad hoc networks is notoriously challenging, notably due to the lack of an online infrastructure. In particular, key management is a problem that has been addressed by many researchers but with limited results. In this paper, we consider the case where an ad hoc network is under the responsibility of a mother certification authority (mCA). Since the nodes can frequently be collectively isolated from the mCA (e.g., for a remote mission) but still need the access to a certification authority, the mCA preassigns a special role to several nodes (called servers) that constitute a distributed certification authority (dCA) during the isolated period. We propose a solution, called DICTATE (DIstributed CerTification Authority with probabilisTic frEshness), to manage the dCA. This solution ensures that the dCA always processes a certificate update (or query) request in a finite amount of time and that an adversary cannot forge a\u00a0\u2026", "Although Visible Light Communication (VLC) is gaining increasing attention in research, developing a practical VLC system to harness its immediate benefits using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices is still an open issue.

CeilingTalk innovates in both encoding and decoding to achieve an adequate throughput for realistic applications. On one hand, it employs Raptor coding to allow multiple LED luminaries to transmit collaboratively so as to benefit both throughput and reliability. On the other hand, it involves a lightweight decoding scheme to handle the asynchrony (both spatial and temporal) in transmissions.

Unfortunately, the practicality of mobile crowdsensing can be crippled due to the lack of incentive mechanisms that stimulate human participation. In this paper, we study incentive mechanisms for a novel Mobile Crowdsensing Scheduling (MCS) problem, where a mobile crowdsensing application owner announces a set of sensing tasks, then human users (carrying mobile devices) compete for the tasks based on their respective sensing costs and available time periods, and finally the owner schedules as well as pays the users to maximize its own sensing revenue under a certain budget.

The traditional wisdom calls for the collection of all the data across the world to a central datacenter location, to be processed using data-parallel applications. This is neither efficient nor practical as the volume of data grows exponentially. Rather than transferring data, we believe that computation tasks should be scheduled where the data is, while data should be processed with a minimum amount of transfers across datacenters. In this paper, we design and implement Flutter, a new task scheduling algorithm that improves the completion times of big data processing jobs across geographically distributed datacenters.

However, device-free (or contactless) sensing is often more sensitive to environment changes than device-based (or wearable) sensing. Also, RF datasets strictly require on-line labeling during collection, starkly different from image and text data collections where human interpretations can be leveraged to perform off-line labeling. Therefore, existing solutions to RF-HAR entail a laborious data collection process for adapting to new environments. To this end, we propose RF-Net as a meta-learning based approach to one-shot RF-HAR; it reduces the labeling efforts for environment adaptation to the minimum level. In particular, we first examine three representative RF sensing techniques and two major meta-learning approaches.

Although many crowdsensing platforms have been built for various applications, the general issue of how to manage such systems intelligently remains largely open. While recent investigations mostly focus on incentivizing crowdsensing, the robustness of crowdsensing toward uncontrollable sensing quality, another important issue, has been widely neglected. Due to the non-professional personnel and devices, the quality of crowdsensing data cannot be fully guaranteed, hence the revenue gained from mobile crowdsensing is generally uncertain. Moreover, the need for compensating the sensing costs under a limited budget has exacerbated the situation: one does not enjoy an infinite horizon to learn the sensing ability of the crowd and hence to make decisions based on sufficient statistics.

The need for location estimation, fueled mainly by inaccuracies of GPS indoors, has been addressed by specifically designed systems achieving a high localization accuracy but with a high deployment cost. Lately, dedicated systems are being replaced by smartphones through intelligent use of the built-in sensors. For instance, an accelerometer that can detect user activity can be combined with a wireless radio that captures wireless signal strength information to locate a user. With the advent of such technology, a myriad of systems have been proposed in the literature presenting an indefinite picture to a reader as to which systems actually work and which do not given practical considerations.

Building upon existing LED lighting systems, CeilingSee converts part of the ceiling-mounted LED luminaires to act as sensors, sensing the variances in diffuse reflection caused by occupants. In realizing CeilingSee, we first re-design the LED driver to leverage LED's photoelectric effect so as to transform a light emitter to a light sensor.

This complicates the Minimum-Energy Multicasting (MEM) problem, which was primarily studied in always-active wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we study the duty-cycle-aware MEM problem in wireless sensor networks both for one-to-many multicasting and for all-to-all multicasting. In the case of one-to-many multicasting, we present a formalization of the Minimum-Energy Multicast Tree Construction and Scheduling (MEMTCS) problem. We prove that the MEMTCS problem is NP-hard, and it is unlikely to have an approximation algorithm with a performance ratio of (1 - 0(1)) ln \u0394, where \u0394 is the maximum node degree in a network.

In contrast to the existing \u201cone-shot\u201d algorithms, our method is superior in that it can improve the co-segmentation results automatically. The experimental results on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark demonstrate that our approach is able to co-segment 3D shapes with significant variability and achieves comparable performance to the existing supervised algorithms and better performance than the unsupervised ones.", "Whereas a lot of efforts have been put on energy conservation in wireless sensor networks, the limited lifetime of these systems still hampers their practical deployments. This situation is further exacerbated indoors, as conventional energy harvesting (e.g., solar) ceases to work. To enable long-lived indoor sensing, we report in this paper a self-sustaining sensing system that draws energy from indoor environments, adapts its duty-cycle to the harvested energy, and pays back the environment by enhancing the awareness of the indoor microclimate through an \"energy-free\" sensing. First of all, given the pervasive operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems indoors, our system harvests energy from airflow introduced by the HVAC systems to power each sensor node. Secondly, as the harvested power is tiny (only of hundreds of \u03bcW), an extremely low but synchronous duty-cycle has to be\u00a0\u2026", "Given the significant amount of time people spend in vehicles, health issues under driving condition have become a major concern. Such issues may vary from fatigue, asthma, stroke, to even heart attack, yet they can be adequately indicated by vital signs and abnormal activities. Therefore, in-vehicle vital sign monitoring can help us predict and hence prevent these issues. Whereas existing sensor-based (including camera) methods could be used to detect these indicators, privacy concern and system complexity both call for a convenient yet effective and robust alternative. This paper aims to develop V2iFi, an intelligent system performing monitoring tasks using a COTS impulse radio mounted on the windshield. V2iFi is capable of reliably detecting driver's vital signs under driving condition and with the presence of passengers, thus allowing for potentially inferring corresponding health issues.

This paper studies a holistic scheduling problem for handling real-time applications in time-triggered in-vehicle networks where practical aspects in system design and integration are captured. The contributions of this paper are multifold. First, it designs a novel scheduling algorithm, referred to as  Unfixed Start Time  (UST) algorithm, which schedules tasks and messages in a flexible way to enhance schedulability. In addition, to tolerate assignment conflicts and further improve schedulability, it proposes two rescheduling and backtracking methods, namely,  Rescheduling with\u00a0\u2026", "Vital signs are crucial indicators for human health, and researchers are studying contact-free alternatives to existing wearable vital signs sensors. Unfortunately, most of these designs demand a subject human body to be relatively static, rendering them very inconvenient to adopt in practice where body movements occur frequently. In particular, radio-frequency (RF) based contact-free sensing can be severely affected by body movements that overwhelm vital signs. To this end, we introduce MoVi-Fi as a motion-robust vital signs monitoring system, capable of recovering fine-grained vital signs waveform in a contact-free manner. Being a pure software system, MoVi-Fi can be built on top of virtually any commercial-grade radars. What inspires our design is that RF reflections caused by vital signs, albeit weak, do not totally disappear but are composited with other motion-incurred reflections in a nonlinear manner.

To deal with this dynamic nature, this paper proposes a set of novel algorithms to solve the joint problem of resource provisioning and caching (i.e., replica placement) for cloud-based CDNs with an emphasis on handling the dynamic demand patterns. Firstly, we propose a provisioning and caching algorithm framework called Differential Provisioning and Caching (DPC) algorithm, which aims to rent cloud resources to build CDNs and whereby to cache contents so that the total rental cost can be minimized while all demands are served\u00a0\u2026", "Location-awareness is crucial to many applications of sensor networks.

The key contribution of NEOS is twofold:(i) it employs a mobile beacon to introduce mobilitydifferentiated time-of-arrival (MDToA) observations, a special form of time difference of arrival (TDoA), at the node side and (ii) it involves simple computations and entails no node-to-node communication. MDToA enables us to devise flexible and robust positioning algorithms; the resulting computational load fully obeys the processing constraints of sensor nodes. Furthermore, the non-interactive feature of NEOS allows of a substantial reduction on the nodes\u2019 energy consumption. We have implemented a preliminary prototype of NEOS using CricketMotes.

The traditional wisdom calls for the collection of all the data across the world to a central data center location, to be processed using data-parallel applications. This is neither efficient nor practical as the volume of data grows exponentially. Rather than transferring data, we believe that computation tasks should be scheduled near the data, while data should be processed with a minimum amount of transfers across data centers. In this paper, we design and implement Flutter, a new task scheduling algorithm that reduces both the completion times and the network costs of big data processing jobs across geographically distributed data centers.

Moreover, only a handful of centralized algorithms have been proposed to elevate 2-D area coverage to 3-D surface coverage. In this paper, we present a practical algorithm, i.e., the Autonomous dePlOyment for Load baLancing k-surface cOverage (APOLLO), to move sensor nodes toward k-surface coverage, aiming at minimizing the maximum sensing range required by the nodes. APOLLO enables purely autonomous node deployment as it only entails localized computations. We prove the termination of the algorithm and the (local) optimality of the output. We also show that our optimization objective is closely related to other frequently\u00a0\u2026", "Finding available parking spaces in dense urban areas is a globally recognized issue in urban mobility. Whereas prior studies have focused on outdoor/street parking due to a common belief that parking garages are capable of delivering real-time occupancy information, we specifically target at (indoor) parking garages as this belief is far from true. This problem is very challenging as all the infrastructure supports (e.g., GPS and Wi-Fi) assumed by existing proposals are not available to parking garages, so counting how many vehicles are using a parking garage by crowd sensing can be extremely difficult. To this end, we present Park Gauge, a method to gauge the occupancy of parking garages, along with a reference system prototype for performance evaluation, it infers parking occupancy from crowd sensed parking characteristics instead of counting the parked vehicles. Park Gauge adopts low-power sensors (e\u00a0\u2026", "We propose a robust normal estimation method for both point clouds and meshes using a low rank matrix approximation algorithm. First, we compute a local isotropic structure for each point and find its similar, non-local structures that we organize into a matrix. We then show that a low rank matrix approximation algorithm can robustly estimate normals for both point clouds and meshes. Furthermore, we provide a new filtering method for point cloud data to smooth the position data to fit the estimated normals. We show the applications of our method to point cloud filtering, point set upsampling, surface reconstruction, mesh denoising, and geometric texture removal. Our experiments show that our method generally achieves better results than existing methods.", "Given the ever-expanding scale of WiFi deployments in metropolitan areas, we have reached the point where accurate GPS-free outdoor localization becomes possible by relying solely on the WiFi infrastructure. Nevertheless, the existing industrial practices do not seem to have the right implementation to achieve an adequate accuracy, while the academic researches that are mostly attracted by indoor localization have largely neglected this outdoor aspect. In this paper, we propose WOLoc (WiFi-only Outdoor Localization) as a solution that offers meter-level accuracy, by holistically treating the large number of WiFi hotspot labels gather by crowdsensing. On one hand, we do not take these labels as fingerprints as it is almost impossible to extend indoor localization mechanisms by fingerprinting metropolitan areas.

Although a few recent proposals have demonstrated the feasibility of this hybrid design, it still remains an open problem how to route DCN traffics with guaranteed performance under a hybrid DCN environment. In this paper, we make the first attempt to tackle this challenge, and propose the RUSH framework to minimize the network congestion in hybrid DCNs, by jointly routing flows and scheduling wireless (directional) antennas. Though the problem is shown to be NP-hard, the RUSH algorithms offer guaranteed performance bounds.

Consequently, each sensor only obtains the information about the direct path; this necessitates a networked sensing system (hence higher system complexity and deployment cost) with at least three sensors to actually locate a source. In this paper, we deem multipath a \"bless\" and thus innovatively exploit the power of it. Essentially, with minor knowledge of the geometry of an indoor space, each signal path may potentially contribute a new piece of information to the location of its source. As a result, it is possible to locate the source with only one hand-held device. At the same time, the extra information provided by multipath can help to at least partially reconstruct the geometry of the indoor space, which enables a floor plan generation process\u00a0\u2026", "The outputs of network monitoring such as traffic matrix and elephant flow identification are essential inputs to many network operations and system designs in DCNs, but most solutions for network monitoring adopt direct measurements or inference alone, which may suffer from either high network overhead or low precision. Different from those approaches, we combine the direct measurements offered by software defined network (SDN) and inference techniques based on network tomography to derive a hybrid network monitoring scheme in this paper; it can strike a balance between measurement overhead and accuracy. Essentially, we use SDN to make the severely low determined network tomography (TM estimation) problem in DCNs to be a more determined one. Thus many classic network tomography algorithms in ISP networks become feasible for DCNs.

Specifically, ZigBee networks share the 2.4GHz ISM band with WiFi but have much lower transmission power. Thus, the ZigBee networks inevitably suffer the interference from WiFi Networks. This paper focuses on the locality of WiFi interference and proposes an interference avoiding approach based on multi-channel for ZigBee networks called MuZi. MuZi has three basic mechanisms: interference assessment, channel switch and connectivity maintenance. The proposed interference assessing approach jointly considers the degree of intensity and density and achieves a much actual relationship between WiFi interference and link quality. Based on this finding, the better working channel for each node is determined.

It exploits acoustic transceivers such as microphones and speakers beyond their primary functions, namely recording and playing, to enable novel applications and new user experiences. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey on recent advances in ubiquitous acoustic sensing using commodity IoT hardware with a frequency range below 24 kHz. We propose a general framework that categorizes main building blocks of acoustic sensing systems. This framework encompasses three layers, i.e.,  device ,  core technique , and  application . The device layer includes basic hardware components, acoustic platforms, as well as the air-borne and structure-borne channel characteristics.

While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In order to further improve the performance, we revisit the reflected light approach and we innovate in converting the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to \"decode\" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds\u00a0\u2026", "Crucial for healthcare and biomedical applications, respiration monitoring often employs wearable sensors in practice, causing inconvenience due to their direct contact with human bodies. Therefore, researchers have been constantly searching for contact-free alternatives. Nonetheless, existing contact-free designs mostly require human subjects to remain static, largely confining their adoptions in everyday environments where body movements are inevitable. Fortunately, radio-frequency (RF) enabled contact-free sensing, though suffering motion interference inseparable by conventional filtering, may offer a potential to distill respiratory waveform with the help of deep learning. To realize this potential, we introduce MoRe-Fi to conduct fine-grained respiration monitoring under body movements. MoRe-Fi leverages an IR-UWB radar to achieve contact-free sensing, and it fully exploits the complex radar signal for\u00a0\u2026", "This paper presents an efficient data-driven approach to track fingertip and detect finger tapping for virtual piano using an RGB-D camera. We collect 7200 depth images covering the most common finger articulation for playing piano, and train a random regression forest using depth context features of randomly sampled pixels in training images. In the online tracking stage, we firstly segment the hand from the plane in contact by fusing the information from both color and depth images. Then we use the trained random forest to estimate the 3D position of fingertips and wrist in each frame, and predict finger tapping based on the estimated fingertip motion. Finally, we build a kinematic chain and recover the articulation parameters for each finger. In contrast to the existing hand tracking algorithms that often require hands are in the air and cannot interact with physical objects, our method is designed for hand interaction\u00a0\u2026", "Traditional crowdsensing platforms rely on sensory information collected from a group of independent users or sensors. Recently, socially aware crowdsensing services have been introduced as the integration of social networks and crowdsensing platforms. For example, in health-related crowdsensing applications, a user benefits from information regarding food, exercise, medicine, and medical treatment collected and shared by his/her socially connected friends and family members. In this article, we first introduce basic concepts of socially aware crowdsensing services and highlight the importance of \"social network effects\" in the services. Typically adopted in social networks, network effects are used to quantify the influence of an action or preference of one user on other users with social ties. With this focus, we then discuss important aspects of socially aware crowdsensing services with network effects and some\u00a0\u2026", "High throughput and lifetime are both crucial design objectives for a number of multihop wireless network applications. As these two objectives are often in conflict with each other, it naturally becomes important to identify the trade-offs between them. Several works in the literature have focused on improving one or the other, but investigating the trade-off between throughput and lifetime has received relatively less attention. We study this trade-off between the network throughput and lifetime for the case of fixed wireless networks, where link transmissions are coordinated to be conflict-free. We employ a realistic interference model based on the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR), which is usually considered statistically sufficient to infer success or failure of wireless transmissions. Our analytical and numerical results provide several insights into the interplay between throughput, lifetime, and transmit power\u00a0\u2026", "Mobile crowdsensing has been intensively explored recently due to its flexible and pervasive sensing ability. Although many crowdsensing platforms have been built for various applications, the general issue of how to manage such systems intelligently remains largely open. While recent investigations mostly focus on incentivizing crowdsensing, the robustness of crowdsensing toward uncontrollable sensing quality, another important issue, has been widely neglected. Due to the nonprofessional personnel and devices, the quality of crowdsensing data cannot be fully guaranteed, hence the revenue gained from mobile crowdsensing is generally uncertain. Moreover, the need for compensating the sensing costs under a limited budget has exacerbated the situation: one does not enjoy an infinite horizon to learn the sensing ability of the crowd and hence to make decisions based on sufficient statistics. In this paper\u00a0\u2026", "The mobile crowdsensing paradigm facilitates a broad range of emerging sensing applications by leveraging ubiquitous mobile users to cooperatively perform certain sensing tasks with their smart devices. As this paradigm involves data collection from users, the issue of designing rewards to incentivize users is fundamentally important to ensure participation in crowdsensing. In this paper, we revisit this issue in the context of socially-aware crowdsensing which integrates crowdsensing into social networks. For example, in healthcare-based crowdsensing services, the fun of tracking daily nutrition information for a certain user can be promoted by comparing her nutritional information with that contributed and shared by her socially-connected friends. To be more general and practical, we study the incentive mechanisms in presence of multiple crowdsensing service providers and multiple users.

Cloud service vendors can offer consumers three purchasing plans, i.e., on-demand, spot, and reserved instances for resource provisioning. Since price of resources in reservation plan is generally cheaper than that in on-demand plan, in this study we attempt to make use of the cheap reserved instances to reduce monetary costs. We consider processing a large divisible load onto on-demand and reserved instances in clouds. Divisible loads, also called embarrassingly parallel workloads, can be partitioned into an arbitrarily large number of independent load fractions and be distributed across multiple processing nodes. We investigate the time-cost optimization problems for provisioning resources and scheduling divisible loads with reserved instances in clouds.

Conventional methods to measure acoustic signals employ microphones as sensors. As signals from multiple acoustic sources are blended during propagation to a sensor, such methods impose a dual challenge of separating the signal for an acoustic event from background noise and from other acoustic events of interest. Recent research has proposed using radio-frequency (RF) signals, e.g., Wi-Fi and millimeter-wave (mmWave), to sense sound directly from source vibrations. Whereas these works allow separating an acoustic event from background noise, they cannot monitor multiple sound sources simultaneously.

The reason for this incompleteness is twofold: i) insufficient network coverage and ii) data aggregation for energy saving. Whereas the existing recovery schemes only tackle the second aspect, we develop Dual-lEvel Compressed Aggregation (DECA) as a novel framework to address both aspects. Specifically, DECA allows a high fidelity recovery of a widespread event, under the situations that the WSN only sparsely covers the event area and that an in-network data aggregation is applied for traffic reduction. Exploiting both the low-rank nature of real-world events and the redundancy in sensory data, DECA combines matrix completion with a fine-tuned compressed sensing technique to conduct a dual-level\u00a0\u2026", "Human activity recognition (HAR) plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications, and it is traditionally achieved via wearable sensing. Recently, to avoid the burden and discomfort caused by wearable devices, device-free approaches exploiting radio-frequency (RF) signals arise as a promising alternative for HAR. Most of the latest device-free approaches require training a large deep neural network model in either time or frequency domain, entailing extensive storage to contain the model and intensive computations to infer human activities. Consequently, even with some major advances on device-free HAR, current device-free approaches are still far from practical in real-world scenarios where the computation and storage resources possessed by, for example, edge devices, are limited. To overcome these weaknesses, we introduce HAR-SAnet which is a novel RF-based HAR framework.

We model the rewarding and participating as a two-stage game, and analyze the MUs' participation level and the CSP's optimal reward mechanism using backward induction. At the same time, the reward is designed taking the underlying social network effects amid the mobile social network into account, for motivating the participants. Namely, one MU will obtain additional benefits from information contributed or shared by local neighbours in social networks.

A novel scheduling problem is formulated to capture a unique feature commonly existing in the safety-critical time-triggered systems, i.e., in task graphs running in such systems, some nodes (i.e., tasks and messages) are strictly periodic while others are not. To address the problem, a novel scheduling algorithm called synchronized highest level first (SHLF) algorithm is presented.

Such an approach seems to make the reasoning about reliability guarantees (traditionally, binary, \u201call-or-nothing\u201d-like) in the face of packet losses and/or node crashes. It is however precisely this determinism that tends to become a limiting factor when aiming at both reliability and scalability, particularly in highly dynamic networks, e.g., ad hoc networks. Gossip-based multicast protocols appear to be a viable path towards providing multicast reliability guarantees. Such protocols embrace the non-deterministic nature of ad hoc networks, providing analytically predictable probabilistic reliability guarantees at a reasonable overhead.

It is only recently that short-lived flows (or mice) have received attention. Whereas stability has been established for the existing primal-dual based control mechanisms, the performance issue has been largely overlooked. We study utility maximization problems for networks with dynamic flows. In particular, we consider the case where sessions of each class results in flows that arrive according to a Poisson process and have a length given by a general distribution. The goal is to maximize the long-term expected system utility that is a function of the number of flows and the rate (identical within a given class) allocated to each flow. Our results show that, as long as the average amount of work brought by the flows is strictly within the network stability region, the rate\u00a0\u2026", "Because data dissemination is crucial to wireless sensor networks (WSNs), its energy efficiency and reliability are of paramount importance. While achieving these two goals together is highly nontrivial, the situation is exacerbated if WSN nodes are duty-cycled (DC) and their transmission power is adjustable. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the expected total transmission power for reliable data dissemination (multicast/broadcast) in DC-WSNs. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we design efficient approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds for it. To facilitate our algorithm design, we propose the novel concept of Time-Reliability-Power (TRP) space as a general data structure for designing data dissemination algorithms in WSNs, and the performance ratios of our algorithms based on the TRP space are proven to be    for both multicast and broadcast, where    is the\u00a0\u2026", "Indoor localization is crucial to enable context-aware applications, but existing solutions mostly require a user to carry a device, so as to actively sense location-discriminating signals. However, many applications do not prefer user involvement due to, e.g., the cumbersome of carrying a device. Therefore, solutions that track user locations passively can be desirable, yet lack of active user involvement has made passive indoor localization very challenging even for a single person. To this end, we propose Passive Acoustic loCalization of multiple walking pErsons (PACE) as a solution for small-scale indoor scenarios: it passively locates users by pinpointing the positions of their footsteps. In particular, PACE leverages both structure-borne and air-borne footstep impact sounds (FIS); it uses structure-borne FIS for range estimations exploiting their acoustic dispersion nature, and it employs air-borne FIS for Angle-of\u00a0\u2026", "Though measuring ambient temperature is often deemed as an easy job, collecting large-scale temperature readings in real-time is still a formidable task. The recent boom of network-ready (mobile) devices and the subsequent mobile crowdsourcing applications do offer an opportunity to accomplish this task, yet equipping commodity devices with ambient temperature sensing capability is highly non-trivial and hence has never been achieved. In this paper, we propose Acoustic Thermometer (AcuTe) as the first ambient temperature sensor empowered by a single commodity smartphone. AcuTe utilizes on-board dual microphones to estimate air-borne sound propagation speed, thereby deriving ambient temperature. To accurately estimate sound propagation speed, we leverage the phase of chirp signals to circumvent the low sample rate on commodity hardware.

Researchers often assume the availability of traffic tracing tools (e.g., OpenFlow) when their proposals require traffic information as input, but these tools may have high monitoring overhead and consume significant switch resources even if they are available in a DCN. Although estimating the traffic matrix (TM) between origin-destination pairs using only basic switch SNMP counters is a mature practice in IP networks, traffic flows in DCNs show totally different characteristics, while the large number of redundant routes in a DCN further complicates the situation.

This situation is further exacerbated indoors, as conventional energy harvesting (e.g., solar) may not always work.

First of all, given the pervasive operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems indoors, our system harvests energy from airflow introduced by the HVAC systems to power each sensor node.

These quorum systems are \u201cgeometric\u201d because curves (rather than discrete node sets) are used to form quorums. We then propose GeoQuorum as a new quorum system, for which the quorum forming curves are parameterized.

However, realizing the promises of RF sensing is highly nontrivial, given typical challenges such as multipath and interference. One potential solution leverages deep learning to build direct mappings from the RF domain to target domains, hence avoiding complex RF physical modeling. While earlier solutions exploit only simple feature extraction and classification modules, an emerging trend adds functional layers on top of elementary modules for more powerful generalizability and flexible applicability. To better understand this potential, this article takes a layered approach to summarize RF sensing enabled by deep learning.

In such applications, on-line boundary detection is a crucial function, as it allows us to track the event variation in a timely fashion. However, the problem becomes very challenging as it demands a highly efficient algorithm to cope with the dynamics introduced by the evolving event. Moreover, as many physical events occupy volumes rather than surfaces (e.g., oil spill again), the algorithm has to work for 3D cases. To this end, we propose UNiform Fast On-Line boundary Detection (UNFOLD) to tackle the challenge. The essence of UNFOLD is to inverse node coordinates such that a \"notched\" surface is \"unfolded\" into a convex one, which in turn reduces boundary detection to simple convexity test.

In recent years, pervasive RF signals are further exploited for sensing; RF sensing has since attracted attentions from both academia and industry. Existing developments mainly employ commodity Wi-Fi hardware or rely on sophisticated SDR platforms. While promising in many aspects, there still remains a gap between lab prototypes and real-life deployments. On one hand, due to its narrow bandwidth and communication-oriented design, Wi-Fi sensing offers a coarse sensing granularity and its performance is very unstable in harsh real-world environments. On the other hand, SDR-based designs may hardly be adopted in practice due to its large size and high cost.

In this paper, we investigate various opportunities of using a high-order modulation to boost the throughput of LED-Camera VLC systems, and we decide that Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) is the most suitable scheme given the limited operating frequency of such systems.

Consequently, we lay our focus on this new type of multi-hop flow problems concerning not data but power. We formulate and analyze a set of such power flow problems (some are joint with data flow), and we devise algorithms to solve them. The intriguing insights obtained from solving these optimization problems offer instructive guidance for future studies on real PWN constructions.", "We address the problem of estimating the real-time traffic flows in data center networks (DCNs), using the light-weight SNMP data.

We introduce two factors to represent the heterogeneity of individual behaviors and the benefit-to-cost enhancement of population, respectively. Based on HPGG CSN model, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between cooperation rate and individuals' heterogeneous behaviors from an evolutionary game perspective.

In this article, we propose a novel data-driven approach to perform multistep ahead forecast accurately for battery TR state at cell-level. We formulate this forecasting task as an imbalance data classification task and propose meta thermal runaway forecasting neural network (Meta-TRFNN) to solve it. Essentially, we exploit high-dimensional thermal images along with low-dimensional temperature and voltage data to capture a more representative thermal profile. Moreover, we adapt a meta-learning framework to handle the data deficiency problem. We evaluate Meta-TRFNN on simulated samples and also explore its applicability in the real world with real samples. Although this classification task is highly imbalanced, Meta-TRFNN is still proven effective with limited historical information\u00a0\u2026", "Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices enabled visible light communication (VLC) for Internet of things (IoT) applications has attracted extensive attentions from both academic and industrial communities, thanks to the pervasive deployments of light emitting diode (LED) lighting infrastructure. However, due to the limitation of frequency response and non-linearity of the commercial illuminating LED light consisting of multiple LED chips, the achievable data rate is far less than that provided by the experimental VLC system with a single LED with specialized devices, e.g., lens. To this end, we propose a power-of-2 arrangement scheme for LED chips to generate spatial summing modulation with low control complexity, and demonstrate its availability in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) VLC system purely built upon COTS devices. It significantly differs from a conventional OFDM VLC system\u00a0\u2026", "Viral marketing through online social networks (OSNs) has aroused great interests in the literature. However, the fundamental problem of how to optimize the \"pure gravy\" of a marketing strategy through influence propagation in OSNs still remains largely open. In this paper, we consider a practical setting where the \"seed nodes\" in an OSN can only be probabilistically activated by the product discounts allocated to them, and make the first attempt to seek a discount allocation strategy to maximize the expected difference of profit and cost (i.e., revenue) of the strategy. We show that our problem is much harder than the conventional influence maximization issues investigated by previous work, as it can be formulated as a non-monotone and non-submodular optimization problem.

Our Feature Pyramid Decoder (FPD) framework applies to all block-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It implants denoising and image restoration modules into a targeted CNN, and it also constraints the Lipschitz constant of the classification layer. Moreover, we propose a two-phase strategy to train the FPD-enhanced CNN, utilizing e-neighbourhood noisy images with multi-task and self-supervised learning. Evaluated against a variety of white-box and black-box attacks, we demonstrate that FPD-enhanced CNNs gain sufficient robustness against general adversarial samples on MNIST, SVHN and CALTECH. In addition, if we further conduct adversarial training, the FPD-enhanced CNNs perform better than their non-enhanced versions.", null, "LED-Camera Visible Light Communication (VLC) is gaining increasing attention, thanks to its readiness to be implemented with Commercial Off-The-Shelf devices and its potential to deliver pervasive data services indoors. Nevertheless, existing LEDCamera VLC systems employ mainly low-order modulations such as On-Off Keying (OOK) given the simplicity of their implementation, yet such rudimentary modulations cannot yield a high throughput. In this paper, we investigate various opportunities of using a high-order modulation to boost the throughput of LED-Camera VLC systems, and we decide that Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) is the most suitable scheme given the limited operating frequency of such systems. However, directly driving an LED to emit different levels of luminance may suffer heavy distortions caused by the nonlinear behavior of LED. As a result, we innovatively propose to generate ASK using\u00a0\u2026", "Due to their limited capabilities, wireless sensor nodes are subject to physical attacks that are hard to defend against. In this paper, we first identify a typical attacker, called parasitic adversary, who seeks to exploit sensor networks by obtaining measurements in an unauthorized way. As a countermeasure, we first employ a randomized key refreshing: with low communication cost, it aims at confining (but not eliminating) the effects of the adversary. Moreover, our low-complexity solution, GossiCrypt, leverages on the large scale of sensor networks to protect data confidentiality, efficiently and effectively. GossiCrypt applies symmetric key encryption to data at their source nodes; and it applies re-encryption at a randomly chosen subset of nodes en route to the sink. The combination of randomized key refreshing and GossiCrypt protects data confidentiality with a probability of almost 1; we show this analytically and with\u00a0\u2026", "Contact-free vital-signs monitoring enabled by radio frequency (RF) sensing is gaining increasing attention, thanks to its non-intrusiveness, noise-resistance, and low cost. Whereas most of these systems only perform respiration monitoring or retrieve heart rate, few can recover fine-grained heartbeat waveform. The major reason is that, though both respiration and heartbeat cause detectable micro-motions on human bodies, the former is so strong that it overwhelms the latter. In this paper, we aim to answer the question in the paper title, by demystifying how heartbeat waveform can be extracted from RF-sensing signal. Applying several mainstream methods to recover heartbeat waveform from raw RF signal, our results reveal that these methods may not achieve what they have claimed, mainly because they assume linear signal mixing whereas the composition between respiration and heartbeat can be highly\u00a0\u2026", "Temperature is an important data source for weather forecasting, agriculture irrigation, anomaly detection, etc. While temperature measurement can be achieved via low-cost yet standalone hardware with reasonable accuracy, integrating thermal sensing into ubiquitous computing devices is highly non-trivial due to the design requirement for specific heat isolation and proper device layout. In this paper, we present the first integrated thermometer using commercial-off-the-shelf acoustic-enabled devices. Our software sonic thermometer (SST) utilizes on-board dual microphones on commodity mobile devices to estimate sound speed, which has a known relation with temperature. To precisely measure temperature via sound speed, we propose a chirp mixing approach to circumvent low sampling rates on commodity hardware and design a pipeline of signal processing blocks to handle channel distortions.

Nevertheless, robustly and accurately learning 3D articulated skeletons from point set sequences captured by a single consumer-grade depth camera still remains challenging, since such data are often corrupted with substantial noise and outliers. Relatively few approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised framework to address this issue. Specifically, we first build one-to-one point correspondences among the point cloud frames in a sequence with our non-rigid point cloud registration algorithm. We then generate a skeleton involving a reasonable number of joints and bones with our skeletal structure extraction algorithm.

One of the key problems in MC is designing the proper mechanisms to incentivize user participation, as users are typically self-interested and must consume a substantial amount of MC resources/costs. Although considerable research has been devoted to this problem, the majority of studies have neglected the privacy issue in mechanism design. In this study, we consider the scenario where a mobile crowdsourcing platform aims to maximize the crowdsourcing revenue under a budget constraint, and users are interested in maximizing their utility while keeping their cost private. We design differentially-private mechanisms for such a scenario under an offline setting where users bid their costs simultaneously and under an online setting where user bids are revealed one by one.

In such applications, fast boundary detection is a crucial function, as it allows us to track the event variation in a timely fashion. However, the problem becomes very challenging as it demands a highly efficient algorithm to cope with the dynamics introduced by the evolving event. Moreover, as many physical events occupy volumes rather than surfaces (e.g., pollution again), the algorithm has to work for 3-D cases. Finally, as boundaries of a 3-D network can be complicated 2-manifolds, many network functionalities (e.g., routing) may fail in the face of such boundaries. To this end, we propose Localized Boundary Detection and Parametrization (LBDP) to tackle these challenges. The first component of LBDP is UNiform Fast On-Line boundary Detection (UNFOLD).

Unfortunately, the preferred inaudible transmission has to strike a balance between the transmission rate and communication range, when the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) is under a certain threshold. Additionally, the performance of previous proposals can be deteriorated by dynamic channel conditions including near-far problem, device heterogeneity, and multipath fading. To this end, we propose a High-speed, long-range, and Robust Chirp Spread Spectrum (HRCSS) scheme for inaudible aerial acoustic communication under dynamic channels. HRCSS innovates in the definition of a loose orthogonality condition, and it leverages this orthogonality to overlap multiple chirp carriers in a single time duration to form a data symbol representing multiple bits, thereby substantially promoting the data rate.

Current GPS-free indoor localization efforts often rely on infrastructure supports such as Wi-Fi or BLE beacons, whereas the smartphone-only proposals mostly require significant data collection and training efforts per garage. In this context, we propose ParkLoc, a novel lightweight smartphone-only solution for vehicular localization in GPS/Wi-Fi-deprived environments such as indoor parking garages. ParkLoc exploits the inherent planar graph structure of the navigable paths in parking facilities, in order to match a vehicle trajectory onto a sub-section of the map, by modeling these as sparse directed graphs. Exploiting an approximate graph matching method, ParkLoc is able to track a vehicle in real-time with a median error of 4.8m and localize a parked vehicle\u00a0\u2026", "Specifically, ZigBee networks share the 2.4 GHz ISM band with WiFi but have much lower transmission power. Therefore, the ZigBee networks inevitably suffer the interference from WiFi networks. In this paper, we focus on utilising the temporal and spatial feature of WiFi interference to adjust Zigbee channel over the whole networks. We experimentally examine the spatiotemporal variation of interference and then present a novel interference assessing method which jointly considers the intensity and density of WiFi interference in order to better characterise the relation between interference and link quality. Further considering the interference locality, we propose MuZi (Multi-channel ZigBee) as an interference avoiding approach for ZigBee networks.

In order to gain proper engineering insights, we look into the problem of improving network throughput by making use of POCs in this paper. Our perspectives are novel in that we 1) adopt a more realistic model to capture the additive nature of interference, 2) apply efficient solution techniques to obtain the optimal solutions of the hard optimization problems, and 3) focus on a typical mesh networking scenario. The outcome of our investigations, though revealing interesting aspects of using multiple channels, contradicts the previous statements by exhibiting that only a marginal gain can be obtained if POCs are used.", "Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems relying on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices have gathered momentum recently, due to the pervasive adoption of LED lighting and mobile devices. However, the achievable throughput by such practical systems is still several orders below those claimed by controlled experiments with specialized devices. In this paper, we engineer SynLight aiming to significantly improve the data rate of a practical VLC system. SynLight adopts COTS LEDs as its transmitter, but it innovates in its simple yet delicate driver circuit wiring an array of LED chips in a combinatorial manner. Consequently, modulated signals can directly drive the on-off procedures of individual chip groups, so that the spatially synthesized light emissions exhibit a varying luminance following exactly the modulation symbols.

While achieving these two goals together is highly non-trivial, the situation is exacerbated if WSN nodes are duty-cycled (DC) and their transmission power is adjustable. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the expected total transmission power for reliable data dissemination (multicast/broadcast) in DC-WSNs. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we design efficient approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds for it.", "This paper proposes novel mechanisms to access sensory data in a distributed fashion in 3D wireless sensor networks. As these networks have their nodes deployed in 3D volumes, we first propose a volume parametrization algorithm to transform irregular volumes into a regular one; it also allows us to extend network protocols from 2D to 3D (which would otherwise be highly non-trivial). Based on this transformation, we propose a new quorum system, 3DQS, to handle distributed data access. The tunability of 3DQS enables it to adapt to different application requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of 3DQS through both analysis and simulations.", "Though the existence of a minimum delay peer-to-peer media streaming scheme has been shown (under the name of snowball streaming), no actual algorithm has ever been designed so far, due to the lack of a systematic way to construct the chunk scheduling that achieves the minimum delay bound. Inspired by the growth of interest in building hybrid streaming systems that consist of backbone trees supplemented by other overlay structures, we revisit the minimum delay streaming problem and design practical min-delay algorithms to support the streaming in the backbone trees. What mainly distinguishes our multi-tree push from the conventional ones is an unbalanced tree design guided by the snow-ball streaming, which has a provable minimum delay.

However, existing sensing devices do not seem to offer a full capability in mapping the in-wall structure while identifying their status (e.g., seepage and corrosion). In this paper, we design and implement SiWa as a low-cost and portable system for wall inspections. Built upon a customized IR-UWB radar, SiWa scans a wall as a user swipes its probe along the wall surface; it then analyzes the reflected signals to synthesize an image and also to identify the material status. Although conventional schemes exist to handle these problems individually, they require troublesome calibrations that largely prevent them from practical adoptions. To this end, we equip SiWa with a deep learning pipeline to parse the rich sensory data.

Unfortunately, the alternative in-network data management schemes may fail to operate in the face of communication voids (or holes) in WSNs (especially 3D WSNs). In response to this challenge, we propose harmonic quorum systems (HQSs) as a lightweight data management system for 2D/3D WSNs. HQSs innovate in exploiting a few scalar fields (constructed using pure localized algorithms) to guide data accesses. This liberates HQSs from depending on any routing mechanisms or location services, hence making HQSs efficient and robust against anomalies in WSN topologies. We implement HQSs in TinyOS, and we perform intensive simulations using TOSSIM to validate the performance of HQSs.", "As mobile shopping has gradually become the mainstream shopping mode, recommendation systems are gaining an increasingly wide adoption.

Numerical results confirm the efficiency of our technique for large scale problems. We also extend the technique to the case where the objective function is nonlinear showing that our technique blends smoothly with a sequential linear programming approach. Numerical results for a cross-layer design with a nonlinear fairness utility show that it is possible to compute optimal solutions for large wireless networks in reasonable CPU time.", "Wireless mesh networks are considered as a potentially attractive alternative to provide broadband access to users.

However, existing solutions can only locate a few sound sources simultaneously due to the limitation imposed by the number of microphones in an array. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multiple blind sound source localization algorithms using Source seParation and BeamForming (SPBF). Our algorithm overcomes the limitations of existing solutions and can locate more blind sources than the number of microphones in an array. Specifically, we propose a novel microphone layout, enabling salient multiple source separation while still preserving their arrival time information. After then, we perform source localization via beamforming using each demixed source. Such a design allows minimizing mutual interference from different sound sources, thereby enabling finer AoA estimation. To further enhance localization performance, we design a new spectral weighting function that can enhance the signal-to-noise-ratio, allowing a relatively narrow beam and thus finer angle of arrival estimation.

On the other hand, the patterns inherent to indoor spaces can significantly degrade the decoding performance of reflected OCC. To this end, we propose CORE-Lens as a pipeline to make the mutual interference transparent to existing OR and OCC algorithms. Essentially, CORE-Lens treats the two challenges as two sides of a signal mixture issue: the signals transmitted by OCC get mixed with background images so well that their features become entangled. Consequently, CORE-Lens exploits the idea of\u00a0\u2026", "Continuous respiration monitoring is significant for real-life healthcare applications, but realizing it is extremely hard as wearable sensors are cumbersome and contact-free sensors largely fail to tolerate user movements. Meanwhile, tracking users indoors mostly demands user-held devices, while device-free localization can barely tell what and who it tracks. Fortunately, as both contact-free respiration monitoring and device-free localization may rely on Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing, fusing them together creates a novel system capable of continuously tracking users while recovering their fine-grained respiratory waveforms. To this end, we propose BreathCatcher as a continuous human respiration tracking system for indoor applications. To build this system, we employ commercial-grade compact radar pairs to capture RF reflections containing respiratory signals. We then propose a hybrid human respiration and\u00a0\u2026", "Acoustic sensing has attracted significant attention recently, thanks to the pervasive availability of device support. However, adopting consumer-grade devices (e.g., smartphones) to deploy acoustic sensing applications faces the challenge of device/OS heterogeneity. Researchers have to pay tremendous efforts in tackling platform-dependent details even in simply accessing raw audio samples, thus losing focus on innovating sensing algorithms. To this end, this paper presents the first Acoustic Software Defined Platform (ASDP): a versatile sensing and general benchmarking platform. ASDP encompasses several customized acoustic modules running on a ubiquitous computing board, backed by a dedicated software framework. It is superior to commodity devices in controlling and reconfiguring physical layer settings, thus offering much better usability.

In this paper, we study the budget-constrained influential social event organization problem, where the goal is to select a group of influential users with required features to organize a social event under a budget B. We show that our problem is NP-hard and can be formulated as a submodular maximization problem with mixed packing and covering constraints. We then propose several polynomial time algorithms for our problem with provable approximation ratios, which adopt a novel \u201csurrogate optimization\u201d approach and the method of reverse-reachable set sampling. Moreover, we also consider the case where the influence spread function is unknown and can be arbitrarily selected from a set of candidate submodular functions, and extend our\u00a0\u2026", "The scheduling of real-time tasks on clusters is a critical issue for offering quality-of-service (QoS) assurance. A significant challenge in real-time task scheduling is to support various types of applications. In this paper we focus on the scheduling of bag-of-tasks (BoT) applications consisting of many independent tasks. BoT applications are a typically \u201cembarrassingly parallel\u201d type of applications which widely exist in various fields in science and engineering. We propose a dynamic (online) real-time scheduling algorithm referred to as scheduling algorithm with migration (SAM) for handling real-time BoT applications on cluster systems. SAM schedules tasks to the minimum number of processors so that computation power can be saved for unscheduled large tasks. SAM also utilizes task migration to optimize load balancing without undermining the schedulability of the tasks.

A recent boom of applying mobile devices to                improve the lifetime of wireless sensor networks has lead to a great deal                of meaningful contributions, both in theory and practice. In this paper,                we survey the efforts relevant to this topic. In addition, we also identify                the lack of theoretical understanding of one of the approaches, namely                mobile sink. We hence briefly describe a theoretical framework that we                have obtained recently; it aims at bringing deeper insight on the optimal                way of using mobile sinks for lifetime improvement.", "Many envisioned applications of ad hoc networks involve only small-scale networks that we term as vicinity ad-hoc groups (VAGs). Distributed coordination services, instead of pairwise communications, are the primary requirements of VAGs. Existing designs for distributed services apply either a layered structure or a vertical integration. While the former contributes to design simplicity, the latter improves runtime efficiency. In this paper, we argue that, since distributed services require group-oriented communications, our NASCENT approach can achieve both design simplicity and runtime efficiency in VAGs, NASCENT is a network layer service dedicated for VAGs. It provides a light-weight membership service along with a routing structure for message passing, and it supports the concurrent execution of various distributed algorithms. NASCENT is also tailored to cope with the transiency of VAGs.

Meanwhile, the popularity of wearables in turn creates a unique opportunity for capturing novel biometrics leveraging various embedded sensing modalities. In this paper, we study a new intracorporal biometrics combining the uniqueness of i) heart motion, ii) bone conduction, and iii) body asymmetry. Specifically, we design HeartPrint as a passive yet secure user authentication system: it exploits the bone-conducted heart sounds captured by (widely available) dual in-ear microphones (IEMs) to authenticate users, while neatly leveraging IEMs renders itself transparent to users without impairing the normal functions of earphones. To suppress the interference from other body sounds and audio produced by the earphones, we develop a novel interference elimination method using modified nonnegative matrix factorization to separate clean heart sounds from background interference. We further explore the uniqueness of IEM-recorded heart sounds in three aspects to extract a novel biometric representation, based on which HeartPrint leverages a convolutional neural model equipped with a continual learning method to achieve accurate authentication under drifting body conditions. Extensive experiments with 18 pairs of commercial earphones on 45 participants confirm that HeartPrint can achieve 1.6% FAR and 1.8% FRR, while effectively coping with major attacks, complicated interference, and hardware diversity.", "Deemed as a practical approach to realize Visible Light Communication on commercial-off-the-shelf devices, the Optical Camera Communication (OCC) is attracting increasing attention, thanks to its readiness to be built purely upon ubiquitous LED illuminating infrastructure and handy smartphones. However, limited by the low sampling ability of the built-in camera on a smartphone, the performance of existing OCC systems is still far away from the requirements of practical applications. To this end, we further investigate the reception ability of the smartphone\u2019s camera and propose an accumulative sampling scheme to improve the performance of the OCC system. Essentially, the proposed scheme can use all the grayscale information of the pixels projected by the LED transmitter, whereas the conventional ones normally use single row (or column) pixels for demodulating.

While both distributed and centralized solutions for proximity detection have been proposed, the cost metrics for evaluating these proposals are always based on counting the number of message (e.g., query or update) exchanges. However, as mobile users often rely on wireless networks to maintain their connectivity, the cost incurred by any message passing is strongly affected by the distance between the sender and receiver. In this paper, we propose TRack Others if You can (TROY) as a novel distributed solution for proximity detection. Extending the principle of spatial tessellations, TROY incurs only localized message exchanges and is thus superior to existing proposals in terms of more realistic cost metrics that take into account the actual\u00a0\u2026", "Having been studied for more than a decade, Wi-Fi human sensing still faces a major challenge in the presence of multiple persons, simply because the limited bandwidth of Wi-Fi fails to provide a suficient range resolution to physically separate multiple subjects. Existing solutions mostly avoid this challenge by switching to radars with GHz bandwidth, at the cost of cumbersome deployments. Therefore, could Wi-Fi human sensing handle multiple subjects remains an open question. This paper presents MUSE-Fi, the first Wi-Fi multi-person sensing system with physical separability. The principle behind MUSE-Fi is that, given a Wi-Fi device (e.g., smartphone) very close to a subject, the near-field channel variation caused by the subject significantly overwhelms variations caused by other distant subjects. Consequently, focusing on the channel state information (CSI) carried by the trafic in and out of this device\u00a0\u2026", "The contact-free sensing nature of Wi-Fi has been leveraged to achieve privacy breaches, yet existing attacks relying on Wi-Fi CSI (channel state information) demand hacking Wi-Fi hardware to obtain desired CSIs. Since such hacking has proven prohibitively hard due to compact hardware, its feasibility in keeping up with fast-developing Wi-Fi technology becomes very questionable. To this end, we propose WiKI-Eve to eavesdrop keystrokes on smartphones without the need for hacking. WiKI-Eve exploits a new feature, BFI (beamforming feedback information), offered by latest Wi-Fi hardware: since BFI is transmitted from a smartphone to an AP in clear-text, it can be overheard (hence eavesdropped) by any other Wi-Fi devices switching to monitor mode. As existing keystroke inference methods offer very limited generalizability, WiKI-Eve further innovates in an adversarial learning scheme to enable its inference generalizable towards unseen scenarios. We implement WiKI-Eve and conduct extensive evaluation on it; the results demonstrate that WiKI-Eve achieves 88.9% inference accuracy for individual keystrokes and up to 65.8% top-10 accuracy for stealing passwords of mobile applications (eg, WeChat).", "In this article, we study the problem of passive human localization using an infrared (IR) thermal imaging camera which detects IR radiation emitted by human without carry-on devices and thereby generates a heat map of human body. Rather than directly using the heat map, we propose to exploit temperature of human body and design a lightweight approach for human localization using machine learning techniques. We observe that person-to-camera distance is closely related with the position and the size of a person\u2019s head in the heat map, and several other features, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis of temperatures in the head region are also good indicators of person-to-camera distance estimation. Accordingly, we propose a set of features and construct a model for inferring person-to-camera distance using machine learning techniques. With the estimated distance, we further compute human\u00a0\u2026", "We study the problem of cross-modality person reidentification (ReID) and tracking with dual visible-infrared (VI) cameras, while most existing efforts on tracking-by-detection have been paid on single-modality visible ReID which is inapplicable for poor-light environments. The major difficulties for cross-modality (e.g., VI) ReID stem from the large modality gap between three-channel visible images and one-channel infrared images and such unknown environmental factors as background clutter, occlusions, etc. To tackle these issues, we propose to enrich the diversities of visible and infrared images for intra- and cross-modality matching by using both the channel-aware data augmentation (DA) techniques (e.g., channel exchanged augmentation and random occlusions) and standard DA techniques. On top of these DA techniques, we incorporate ResNet50 and vision transformer (ViT) into the feature extraction\u00a0\u2026", "Whereas the increasing popularity of both commercial light-emitting diode (LED) lighting and mobile devices certainly creates opportunity for real-life deployment of visible light communication (VLC) systems, reaching the high throughput promised by lab experiments still faces major obstacles. In particular, lacking the sophisticated hardware and software support under experimental conditions, real-life systems are challenged in many aspects, especially low signal-to-noise ratio, low operation frequency, uncontrollable LED nonlinearity, and illumination requirements. Nonetheless, deployments tapping commercial infrastructure are critical to gain market penetration for VLC-enabled wireless applications, so boosting the performance of these real-life systems becomes imperative.

In this paper, we aim at overcoming the impossibility through a distributed parametrization that equips a WSN with virtual coordinates favoring greedy routing. We propose a fundamentally new parametrization to embed the network domain, the resulting embedding domain allows greedy routing to have guaranteed delivery. We also present localized algorithms to realize this map in WSNs. To combat the load concentration caused by greedy routing that applies the distance greedy principle, we further propose tunable greedy routing, which relies on tuning a parameter in the greedy objective to naturally balance routing load. These two proposals form our Greedy Routing through dIstributed Parametrization (GRIP).

This high battery drainage could be reduced by lowering the sampling rate of GPS. However, to fill the reception gaps introduced by low sampling rate, other methods need to be explored. The sensors available in the smartphones allow incremental positioning based on dead reckoning. Even though dead reckoning is a widely researched topic in navigation and walking based localization, it still lacks research on smartphone low-quality sensor based localization for vehicular motion. Therefore this paper describes a dead reckoning system design and implementation for vehicular motion on Android smartphones. It adapts and presents currently used methods for each system step (i.e. filtering, gravity removal, heading estimation and velocity/displacement integration). It also presents new research finding on accelerometer\u00a0\u2026", "Object detection with on-board sensors (e.g., lidar, radar, and camera) play a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD), and these sensors complement each other in modalities. While crowdsensing may potentially exploit these sensors (of huge quantity) to derive more comprehensive knowledge, \\textit{federated learning} (FL) appears to be the necessary tool to reach this potential: it enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to train machine learning models without explicitly sharing raw sensory data. However, the multimodal sensors introduce various data heterogeneity across distributed AVs (e.g., label quantity skews and varied modalities), posing critical challenges to effective FL. To this end, we present AutoFed as a heterogeneity-aware FL framework to fully exploit multimodal sensory data on AVs and thus enable robust AD. Specifically, we first propose a novel model leveraging pseudo-labeling to avoid mistakenly treating unlabeled objects as the background. We also propose an autoencoder-based data imputation method to fill missing data modality (of certain AVs) with the available ones. To further reconcile the heterogeneity, we finally present a client selection mechanism exploiting the similarities among client models to improve both training stability and convergence rate. Our experiments on benchmark dataset confirm that AutoFed substantially improves over status quo approaches in both precision and recall, while demonstrating strong robustness to adverse weather conditions.", "Wi-Fi signals may help realize low-cost and non-invasive human sensing, yet it can also be exploited by eavesdroppers to capture private information. Very few studies rise to handle this privacy concern so far; they either jam all sensing attempts or rely on sophisticated technologies to support only a single sensing user, rendering them impractical for multi-user scenarios. Moreover, these proposals all fail to exploit Wi-Fi's multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO) capability. To this end, we propose MIMOCrypt, a privacy-preserving Wi-Fi sensing framework to support realistic multi-user scenarios. To thwart unauthorized eavesdropping while retaining the sensing and communication capabilities for legitimate users, MIMOCrypt innovates in exploiting MIMO to physically encrypt Wi-Fi channels, treating the sensed human activities as physical plaintexts. The encryption scheme is further enhanced via an optimization framework, aiming to strike a balance among i) risk of eavesdropping, ii) sensing accuracy, and iii) communication quality, upon securely conveying decryption keys to legitimate users. We implement a prototype of MIMOCrypt on an SDR platform and perform extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness in common application scenarios, especially privacy-sensitive human gesture recognition.", "Recently,  passive behavioral biometrics  (e.g., gesture or footstep) acquired from wireless networks or mobile services have become promising complements to conventional user identification methods (e.g., face or fingerprint) under special situations, yet existing sensing technologies require lengthy measurement traces and cannot identify multiple users at the same time. To this end, we propose PURE as a passive multi-person identification system leveraging deep learning enabled footstep separation and recognition. PURE passively identifies a user by identifying the unique \u201cfootprints\u201d in its footstep. Different from existing gait-enabled recognition systems incurring a long sensing delay to acquire many footsteps, PURE can recognize a person by as few as only one step, substantially cutting the identification latency.

However, for inner doors in environments like factories, existing locking mechanisms can be poor in user-friendliness and high in cost. For instance, mechanical locks require carrying keys that inevitably compromise user experiences, while smart locks always require non-trivial sensors. Therefore, inner doors urgently require a lightweight unlocking scheme that can properly balance user-friendliness, cost, and security. To this end, we propose HandKey as a keyless unlocking scheme to supplement existing lock systems. HandKey relies on two principles: the simplicity of hand knocking doors and the uniqueness of vibration triggered by the knocking force. In other words, a door and a hand knocking it jointly form a unique physical system that generates hand-dependent and user-specific vibration signatures uniquely\u00a0\u2026", "The intention of leveraging Radio-Frequency (RF) resources for diverse sensing purposes has grown increasingly keen, thanks to the ever-expanding deployment of IoT devices using RF communications to maintain connectivity. To this end, we propose ISACoT as the framework for enabling Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) over IoT devices. ISACoT extends over existing devices via four aspects, namely time, frequency, space, and protocol. We argue that, as the multistatic communication infrastructure of IoT is adverse to device-free sensing (e.g., lack of precise time synchronization), the keystone of ISACoT should be to operate sensing in a monostatic mode (like radar). We tackle the fundamental time aspect based on Wi-Fi first, then explore the other three aspects with both preliminary proposals made and potential challenges raised for future extensions.", "Bump hunting is an important approach to the extraction of insights from Euclidean datasets. Recently, it has been explored for graph datasets for the first time, and a single bump is hunted in an unweighted graph in this exploration. Here, we extend this exploration by hunting multiple bumps in a weighted graph. Given a weighted graph and a set of query nodes exhibiting a property of interest, our objective is to find k non-overlapping and connected subgraphs, i.e., bumps, in which the discrepancy between the numbers of query and non-query nodes is maximized and the sum of edge costs is minimized simultaneously. We prove that our extended bump hunting problem can be transformed to a recently formulated Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest Problem (PCSFP). We further prove that PCSFP is NP-hard even in trees. Then, we propose a fast approximation algorithm for solving PCSFP in trees. Based on this\u00a0\u2026", "In recent years, particular attention has been devoted to earable acoustic sensing due to its numerous applications.

Meanwhile, the growing popularity of active noise cancellation (ANC) has endowed common earphones with high standard acoustic capability yet to be explored by sensing. To this end, we propose EarACE to be the first acoustic sensing platform exploiting the native acoustics of commercial ANC earphones, significantly improving upon self-crafted earphone sensing devices. EarACE takes a compact design to handle hardware heterogeneity and to deliver flexible control on audio facilities. Leveraging a systematic study on in-ear acoustic signals, EarACE gains abilities to combat performance\u00a0\u2026", "Vibration sensing is crucial to human life and work, as vibrations indicate the status of their respective sources (eg, heartbeat to human health condition). Given the inconvenience of contact sensing, both academia and industry have been intensively exploring contact-free vibration sensing, with several major developments leveraging radio-frequency (RF) technologies made very recently. However, a measurement study systematically comparing these options is still missing. In this paper, we choose to evaluate five representative commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RF technologies with different carrier frequencies, bandwidths, and waveform designs. We first unify the sensing data format and processing pipeline, and also propose a novel metric v-SNR to quantify sensing quality. Then our extensive evaluations start from controlled experiments for benchmarking, followed by investigations on two real-world applications: machinery vibration measurement and vital sign monitoring. Our comprehensive study reveals that Wi-Fi performs the worst among all five technologies, while a lesser-known UWB-based technology achieves the best overall performance, and others have respective pros and cons in different scenarios.", "Metamaterial-based reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) have been proposed as novel cost-efficient antenna arrays, which are promising for improving the positioning and communication performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. However, due to the high frequency selectivity of the metamaterial elements, RHSs face challenges in supporting ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB), which significantly limits the positioning precision. In this paper, to avoid the physical limitations of UWB RHS while enhancing the performance of RHS-based ISAC systems, we propose a multi-band (MB) based ISAC system. We analyze its positioning precision and propose an efficient algorithm to optimize the large number of variables in analog and digital beamforming. Through comparison with benchmark results, simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed system and algorithm, and show that the system achieves  less positioning error, which reduces  communication capacity loss.", "User authentication is a critical module to achieve security and privacy protections, especially for pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. However, existing methods on IoT devices are significantly short of  implementability  thanks to the lack of device uniformity and protocol openness. For instance, password becomes useless for devices void of text entry interfaces. Biometrics may not scale well as they require both non-trivial sensors and cumbersome user involvement. Proximity-based methods exploiting shared ambient contexts are vulnerable to co-located malicious attacks. Therefore, a low-cost authentication scheme widely implementable on heterogeneous IoT devices is urgently demanded.

However, existing techniques entailing periodic offline inspections fail to continuously monitor transformer winding states while causing extra costs due to the outage during inspections. This has driven researchers to consider effective continuous online monitoring methods from several technical perspectives, including typically port voltage current analysis, online frequency response analysis, and vibration analysis. Since these methods are conventionally evaluated with qualitative comparisons focusing only on feasibility, quantitative assessments indispensable for the targeted improvement of the methods and the most suitable method decision in specific scenarios are still missing.

Recently, proposals on indoor\u2013outdoor detection have made the first step towards such an integration, yet complicated urban environments render such a binary classification incompetent. Fortunately, the latest developments in Android have granted us access to raw GNSS measurements, which contain far more information than commonly derived GPS location indicators. In this paper, we explore these newly available measurements in order to better characterize diversified urban environments. Essentially, we tackle the challenges introduced by the complex GNSS data and apply a deep learning model to identify representations for respective location contexts. We further develop two preliminary applications of our deep profiling: one, we offer a more fine-grained semantic classification than binary indoor\u2013outdoor detection; and two, we derive a GPS error indicator that is more meaningful than that provided by Google Maps. These results are all corroborated by our extensive data collection and trace-driven evaluations.", "Whereas adversarial training can be useful against specific adversarial perturbations, they have also proven ineffective in generalizing towards attacks deviating from those used for training. However, we observe that this ineffectiveness is intrinsically connected to domain adaptability, another crucial issue in deep learning for which adversarial domain adaptation appears to be a promising solution. Consequently, we proposed Adv-4-Adv as a novel adversarial training method that aims to retain robustness against unseen adversarial perturbations. Essentially, Adv-4-Adv treats attacks incurring different perturbations as distinct domains, and by leveraging the power of adversarial domain adaptation, it aims to remove the domain/attack-specific features. This forces a trained model to learn a robust domain-invariant representation, which in turn enhances its generalization ability. Extensive evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that a model trained by Adv-4-Adv based on samples crafted by simple attacks (e.g., FGSM) can be generalized to more advanced attacks (e.g., PGD), and the performance exceeds state-of-the-art proposals on these datasets.", "In many practical scenarios of signal extraction from a nonlinear mixture, only one (signal) source is intended to be extracted. However, modern methods involving Blind Source Separation are inefficient for this task since they are designed to recover all sources in the mixture. In this paper, we propose supervised Variational Component Decoder (sVCD) as a method dedicated to extracting a single source from nonlinear mixture. sVCD leverages the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) translation ability of a specially designed neural network to approximate a nonlinear inverse of the mixture process, assisted by priors of the interested source. In order to maintain the robustness in the face of real-life samples, sVCD combines Seq2Seq with variational inference to form a deep generative model, and it is trained by optimizing a variant of variational bound on the data likelihood concerning only the interested source. We demonstrate that sVCD has superior performance on nonlinear source extraction over a state-of-the-art method on diverse datasets, including artificially generated sequences, radio frequency (RF) sensing data, and electroencephalogram (EEG) results.", "The extremely high frequency of Millimeter-Wave technology warrants Gbps throughput for the next-generation wireless communication systems, but mmWave signals also suffer from severe path loss due to high attenuation. To compensate for this loss, mmWave radios establish communication links via directional beams so as to increase channel gains and communication range. Until recently, the measurement studies on mmWave technology were mainly based on prototypes built from band-limited Software Defined Radio, which could not characterize performance in realistic settings.

To achieve this task, conventional approaches [including dedicated application specific integrated circuit-based designs] often demand  analog  readout chains and compulsory add-ons [e.g., additional analogy-to-digital converter (ADC) for peak sampling], rendering them neither compact nor flexible. In this article, we propose a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-only solution to fulfill this task without any external components. Specifically, we achieve peak detection with only a low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) comparator and two general-purpose input/outputs (GPIOs). Therefore, one can flexibly make a practical deployment by a simple routing process, a nontrivial task even for inexperienced engineers. Meanwhile, to further compact the design for peak sampling, we leverage an FPGA-based slope ADC within which, we propose a new resource\u00a0\u2026", "Hand pose estimation (HPE), which aims to identify and recover the keypoints of a hand, is essential to many potential applications. Conventional computer vision (CV) methods extract visible features from images or videos captured by cameras.

Fortunately, CV leveraging widely available radio frequency (RF) signals (also known as RF vision) can fully address the problem with much lower computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Ske-Fi as an avatar of HPE enabled by RF vision, which uses the emerging Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) available on smart devices (e.g., Apple air tag) to sense the reflected RF signals of a hand to extract the hand skeleton features for pose estimation.

However, these methods suffer from inconvenience and additional equipment requirements, preventing people from monitoring their hearts in any place at any time. Inspired by our observation of the correlation between pupil size and heart rate varaiability (HRV), we consider using the pupillary response when a user unlocks his/her phone using facial recognition to infer the user\u2019s HRV during this time, thus enabling heart monitoring.

In this paper, we propose to exploit Radio-Frequency-Vision (RF-vision) capable of bypassing obstacles for achieving occluded HPE, and we introduce OCHID-Fi as the first RF-HPE method with 3D pose estimation capability. OCHID-Fi employs wideband RF sensors widely available on smart devices (eg, iPhones) to probe 3D human hand pose and extract their skeletons behind obstacles. To overcome the challenge in labeling RF imaging given its human incomprehensible nature, OCHID-Fi employs a cross-modality and cross-domain training process. It uses a pre-trained CM-HPE network and a synchronized CM/RF dataset, to guide the training of its complex-valued RF-HPE network under LoS conditions. It further transfers knowledge learned from labeled LoS domain to unlabeled occluded domain via adversarial learning, enabling OCHID-Fi to generalize to unseen occluded scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of OCHID-Fi: it achieves comparable accuracy to CM-HPE under normal conditions while maintaining such accuracy even in occluded scenarios, with empirical evidence for its generalizability to new domains.", "Described herein is a framework for outdoor localization.
