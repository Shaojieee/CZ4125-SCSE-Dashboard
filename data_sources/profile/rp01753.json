However, the accuracy of reputation systems has always been a concern for the users due to the existence of unfair ratings. Though many approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of unfair ratings, most of them use the credibility of the rating provider alone to decide whether the rating is unfair without considering other aspects of the rating itself. Models that do consider multiple aspects often combine them through arbitrarily set weights. Therefore, they cannot work well when the credibility is not evaluated accurately or when the weights are not set properly. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a reputation model which considers and combines the temporal, similarity and quantity aspects of the user ratings based on fuzzy logic to improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation. Experimental results based on a set of real user data from a cyber competition show that the proposed model is more robust against unfair ratings than the existing approaches, especially under Sybil attack conditions.", "The problem of unfair testimonies has to be addressed effectively to improve the robustness of reputation systems. We propose an integrated CLUstering-Based approach called iCLUB to filter unfair testimonies for reputation systems using multi-nominal testimonies, in multiagent-based electronic commerce. It adopts clustering and considers buying agents\u2019 local and global knowledge about selling agents. Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results of our approach in filtering various types of unfair testimonies.", "Cooperative spectrum sensing by secondary user (SU) nodes in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is a promising approach to increase the spectrum access efficiency and overall network performance. However, unreliable sensing results or malicious behaviors from cooperator SU nodes can be very disruptive and reduce the network performance. Trust and reputation modeling has been identified as one of the potential solutions to address this problem, but the current centralized trust evaluation approach in CRN lacks scalability. Although some decentralized trust models have been proposed in CRN, without proper protection mechanisms, they are vulnerable to collusive behaviors by the witness SU nodes when they share testimonies about the trustworthiness of neighboring SU nodes. In this paper, we propose a clustering based witness selection method to address this problem. By dividing the witness SU nodes\u00a0\u2026", "The need for protecting rights over relational data is of ever increasing concern. There have recently been some pioneering works in this area. In this paper, we propose an effective fingerprinting scheme based on the idea of block method in the area of multimedia fingerprinting. The scheme ensures that certain bit positions of the data contain specific values. The bit positions are determined by the keys known only to the owner of the data and different buyers of the database have different bit positions and different specific values for those bit positions. The detection of the fingerprint can be completed even with a small subset of a marked relation in case that the sample contains the fingerprint. Our extensive analysis shows that the proposed scheme is robust against various forms of attacks, including adding, deleting, shuffling or modifying tuples or attributes and colluding with other recipients of a relation\u00a0\u2026", "Reputation systems have contributed much to the success of electronic marketplaces. However, the problem of unfair testimonies has to be addressed effectively to improve the robustness of reputation systems. Until now, most of the existing approaches focus only on reputation systems using binary testimonies, and thus have limited applicability and effectiveness.

Such a technique is often inconvenient, infrequent, and subjective, which leads to a high misdiagnosis rate. As several cardinal symptoms of PD require long term observations, a technology platform which allows potential PD patients to exhibit related behaviors in a natural setting over long period of time is needed. In this paper, we describe an agent-based game for the predictive diagnosis of PD. Agents in this tablet based game provide companionship, encouragement, and analysis capabilities to help retain users' interest, and analyze their risk of developing PD symptoms based on their in-game behavior. The game has been launched together with a world renowned PD research centre for clinical trial. It can potentially provide a new dimension of longitudinal interactive behavior data to assist\u00a0\u2026", "Crowdsourcing is a rapidly growing technology to harness human intelligence to solve problems that are not suitable for automation. It is especially suitable for consensus tasks which collect opinions from human workers to gain insight into real-world phenomena. In these tasks, motivating workers to provide their truthful opinions is a challenging problem. Most existing incentive mechanisms proposed to address this problem assume that workers share a common prior. However, this assumption is not always valid in practice, resulting in that the existing approaches may discourage workers to provide their truthful opinions. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism -- iMET -- to elicit truthful opinions for crowdsourced multiple-choice consensus tasks. By incorporating the concepts of worker credibility and similarity, iMET rewards workers for providing truthful opinions without assuming a common prior\u00a0\u2026", "The current generation of senior citizens are enjoying unparalleled levels of good health than previous generations. The need for personal fulfilment after retirement has driven many of them to participate in productive aging activities such as volunteering. This paper outlines the Silver Productive (SP) mobile app, a system powered by the RTS-P intelligent personalized task sub-delegation approach with dynamic worker effort pricing functions. It provides an algorithmic crowdsourcing platform to enable seniors to contribute their effort through productive aging activities and help organizations efficiently utilize seniors' collective productivity.", "Reputation systems have contributed much to resisting against the threats from malicious seller agents in electronic marketplaces. Buyer agents can benefit from modeling the reputation of seller agents to make a decision on which seller to have transaction with. However, the existence of unfair ratings decreases the accuracy of the seller agents' reputation evaluation, which will lead to inappropriate sellers to be selected and hence harm buyers' profits. In this paper, to address the problem of unfair ratings, we propose a witness trustworthiness model based on Dempster-Shafer theory to evaluate the trustworthiness of a witness's ratings regarding a particular seller. The proposed approach uses local and global ratings together to model a witness's trustworthiness which is specific for different sellers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively address the problem of unfair\u00a0\u2026", "Cognitive inhibition, a key constituent of healthy cognition, has been shown to be susceptible to age-related cognitive declines. Research has shown that cognitive rehabilitation training can facilitate older adults to maintain healthy cognitive functions. Compared to cognitive rehabilitation alone, the combination of physical and cognitive exercises is more effective to train older adults\u2019 cognitive functions. Focusing on the training of older adults\u2019 cognitive inhibition, we design the Ping Pong exergame in this work, which incorporates the traditional cognitive task with physical exercises in the game environment to improve older adults\u2019 cognitive inhibition. A longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the usability of Ping Pong exergame and its effectiveness on training older adults\u2019 cognitive inhibition.

Real user attack data collected from a cyber competition is used to construct the testing data set. Compared with two representative reputation schemes and our previous scheme, TATA achieves a significantly better performance in terms of identifying items under attack, detecting malicious users who insert dishonest ratings, and recovering reputation scores.", "Games for disease diagnosis and rehabilitation are developing rapidly in recent years.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most debilitating neuro-degenerative disorders that seriously affect the seniors' quality of life. In recent years, video games have been shown to be a viable way through which partial rehabilitation for PD can be carried out in a fun and low cost manner. Earlier research has shown that both patients' physical and mental conditions can be improved by playing video games. However, so far, the available games developed for PD are mostly intended for rehabilitation purposes. PD diagnosis still depends on the traditional neurological exams and experience of doctors, which require the patients to become self-aware of the symptoms and are usually too late for the patients to delay the progression of PD. To support the early detection of PD symptoms, we\u00a0\u2026", null, "Reputation models depend on the ratings provided by buyers togauge the reliability of sellers in multi-agent based e-commerce environment. However, there is no prevention forthe cases in which a buyer misjudges a seller, and provides a negative rating to an original satisfactory transaction. In this case, how should the seller get his reputation repaired andutility loss recovered? In this work, we propose a mechanism to mitigate the negativeeffect of the misreported ratings. It temporarily inflates the reputation of thevictim seller with a certain value for a period of time. This allows the seller to recover hisutility loss due to lost opportunities caused by the misreported ratings. Experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.", "Explainable AI has attracted much research attention in recent years with feature attribution algorithms, which compute \"feature importance\" in predictions, becoming increasingly popular. However, there is little analysis of the validity of these algorithms as there is no \"ground truth\" in the existing datasets to validate their correctness. In this work, we develop a method to quantitatively evaluate the correctness of XAI algorithms by creating datasets with known explanation ground truth. To this end, we focus on the binary classification problems. String datasets are constructed using formal language derived from a grammar. A string is positive if and only if a certain property is fulfilled. Symbols serving as explanation ground truth in a positive string are part of an explanation if and only if they contributes to fulfilling the property. Two popular feature attribution explainers, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), are used in our experiments.We show that: (1) classification accuracy is positively correlated with explanation accuracy; (2) SHAP provides more accurate explanations than LIME; (3) explanation accuracy is negatively correlated with dataset complexity.", "Modeling is commonly used in the process of software development. UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standard software modeling language and has been widely adopted for software analysis and design. As software systems are getting larger and more complex nowadays, software modeling using UML often requires collective and collaborative efforts from multiple software designers. In contrast, most of today's software modeling applications are still single-user-oriented and do not offer much help to coordinate interaction and collaboration among team members. In this paper, we will present the technical challenges and solutions in providing advanced collaboration capabilities and transparently integrating them into mainstream software modeling applications to effectively facilitate collaboration among geographically dispersed software designers. The work has been tested and demonstrated by the\u00a0\u2026", "The problem of unfair testimonies remains an open issue in reputation systems for online trading communities. A common attempt is to use binary ratings to model sellers\u2019 reputation. However, this attempt leads to that the research of tackling unfair testimonies also focuses on reputation systems using binary ratings. In this extended abstract, we propose a two-stage clustering approach to filter unfair testimonies for reputation systems using multi-nominal ratings. The proposed approach uses clustering to identify unfair testimonies and further contributes to providing buyers a more accurate reputation evaluation regarding the target seller.", "Most of the current recommender systems focus on estimating user preferences. However, a person's interest in an item is not determined by his/her preference alone. Psychological research has shown that curiosity is a critical motivation relating to a person's interests and driving explorative behaviours. Motivated as above, we aim to model user curiosity in social recommendation context. In this work, we model uncertainty driven curiosity, wherein uncertainty is a well acknowledged factor that stimulates human curiosity. We model user uncertainty based on two well-known theories of uncertainty, i.e., Shannon entropy and Damster-Shafter theory. Then, we rank items by consolidating both user preference and user uncertainty using weighted Borda count. The proposed model is evaluated with two large-scale real world datasets, Douban and Flixster. The experimental results highlight that uncertainty driven\u00a0\u2026", "The problem of unfair testimonies remains to be a big concern in reputation systems. To address this problem, we propose a witness trustworthiness model based on Dempster-Shafer theory for reputation systems using multi-nominal testimonies. The proposed approach uses Dempster-Shafer theory to model a witness\u2019s trustworthiness from both personal and public aspects. Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results of the proposed approach in modeling witnesses\u2019 trustworthiness and adapting to the buyer specified subjective difference tolerance level.", "In e-commerce, recommendation is an essential feature to provide users with potentially interesting items to purchase. However, people are often faced with an unpleasant situation, where the recommended items are simply the ones similar to what they have purchased previously. One of the main reasons is that existing recommender systems in e-commerce mainly utilize primary implicit feedback (i.e., purchase history) for recommendation. Little attention has been paid to secondary implicit feedback (e.g., viewing items, adding items to shopping cart, adding items to favorite list, etc), which captures users' potential interests that may not be reflected in their purchase history. We therefore propose a personalized recommendation approach to combine the primary and secondary implicit feedback to generate the recommendation list, which is optimized towards a Bayesian objective criterion for personalized ranking\u00a0\u2026", "Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that the elderly are prone to. The recent statistics shows that PD threatens the living quality of over 10 million people worldwide and most of the patients are over 60 ages. Though some medications have been found to be effective in the management of disease progression, the conditions of patients\u2019 symptoms need to be monitored carefully to ensure the effectiveness of appropriate dosage of medications and other necessary treatments to be applied in case that the medications become less effective. Therefore, to facilitate patients and clinicians to have an objective assessment of the conditions of PD symptoms and monitor the effectiveness of treatment, we design a mobile game platform \u2013 Pumpkin Garden, which is able to encourage patients to assess their daily conditions through playing games.

The pandemic and the associated NPIs have triggered unprecedented waves of economic shocks to the financial markets, including the foreign exchange (FX) markets. Although there are some studies exploring the impact of the NPIs and ESPs on FX markets, the relative impact of individual NPIs or ESPs has not been studied in a combined framework. In this work, we investigate the relative impact of NPIs and ESPs with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Experiments over exchange rate data of G10 currencies during the period from January 1, 2020 to January 13, 2021 suggest strong impacts on exchange rate markets by all measures of the strict lockdown, such as stay at home requirements, workplace closing, international travel control, and restrictions on internal movement. Yet, the impact of individual NPI and ESP can vary across different currencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses XAI techniques to study the relative impact of NPIs and ESPs on the FX market. The derived insights can guide governments and policymakers to make informed decisions when facing with the ongoing pandemic and a similar situation in the near future.", "Since COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019, various public health interventions have been implemented across the world. As different measures are implemented at different countries at different times, we conduct an assessment of the relative effectiveness of the measures implemented in 18 countries and regions using data from 22/01/2020 to 02/04/2020. We compute the top one and two measures that are most effective for the countries and regions studied during the period. Two Explainable AI techniques, SHAP and ECPI, are used in our study; such that we construct (machine learning) models for predicting the instantaneous reproduction number () and use the models as surrogates to the real world and inputs that the greatest influence to our models are seen as measures that are most effective. Across-the-board, city lockdown and contact tracing are the two most effective measures. For ensuring , public wearing face masks is also important. Mass testing alone is not the most effective measure although when paired with other measures, it can be effective. Warm temperature helps for reducing the transmission.", "Falling down is a great threat to the health of the elderly. Existing approaches for fall detection, such as threshold methods and offline classification methods, have been shown to be useful for providing emergency medical care for the elderly. However, those offline models lack generalization and adaptability for all the users in everyday life, which severely restricts their applications in real life situations. In this paper, we propose a cloud computing based fall detection framework which can update the model online with two-stage incremental update step. By applying cloud computing, the framework can take advantage of wearable sensors for more accurate and efficient fall detection. The proposed framework is comprised of a two-stage incremental update, which consists of local and cloud components. The local component updates the detection model with feedback from users, which can make the model more\u00a0\u2026", "Reputation systems aggregate the ratings provided by buyers to gauge the reliability of sellers in e-marketplaces. The evaluation accuracy of seller reputation significantly impacts the sellers' future utility. The existence of unfair ratings is well-recognized to negatively affect the accuracy of reputation evaluation. Most of the existing approaches dealing with unfair ratings focus on filtering/discounting/aligning the possible unfair ratings caused by malicious attacks or subjective difference. However, these approaches are not effective against unfair ratings in the form of misreporting (e.g., a well-behaving buyer misjudged a seller and provided a negative rating to a transaction which deserves a positive one, and the buyer is willing to revert the misreported negative rating). In this case, how should the buyer undo the damage caused by such misreported ratings and help the seller recover utility loss? In this paper, we\u00a0\u2026", "From a dataset, one can construct different machine learning (ML) models with different parameters and/or inductive biases. Although these models give similar prediction performances when tested on data that are currently available, they may not generalise equally well on unseen data. The existence of multiple equally performing models exhibits underspecification of the ML pipeline used for producing such models. In this work, we propose identifying underspecification using feature attribution algorithms developed in Explainable AI. Our hypothesis is: by studying the range of explanations produced by ML models, one can identify underspecification. We validate this by computing explanations using the Shapley additive explainer and then measuring statistical correlations between them. We experiment our approach on multiple datasets drawn from the literature, and in a COVID-19 virus transmission\u00a0\u2026", "The explosive popularity of e-commerce sites has reshaped users' shopping habits and an increasing number of users prefer to spend more time shopping online. This evolution allows e-commerce sites to collect rich data about users. The majority of traditional recommender systems have focused on the macro interactions between users and items, particularly the purchase history of customers. However, decision support only achieved limited performance due to the mismatch between the causality and the interaction sequence. It is especially challenging for products with low purchase frequency, such as refrigerators, or new users with little history data. To address the problem, we investigated how to leverage the heterogenous information, including decision making information to improve recommender systems, helping users approach their items easier and more accurately. Specifically, we propose to model\u00a0\u2026", "Cognitive abilities, including cognitive inhibition, degenerate with the aging process. In this demonstration, we present a Kinect-based interactive game which aims to improve the cognitive inhibition ability of the elderly. The game is designed in the table tennis theme, and the adoption of Kinect makes it convenient for the elderly to use. The players\u2019 in-game behaviour data are recorded for the health advisor agent to conduct personalization, analysis, and decision making. A pilot study has been conducted to investigate the relationship between the players\u2019 cognitive inhibition abilities and their in-game performance. The study results suggest that the in-game performance can reflect a player\u2019s cognitive inhibition ability, and indicate that the game can be used to improve the cognitive inhibition ability of the elderly in the future.", "Activity recognition is a key problem in multi-sensor systems.

In this paper, we propose a Dempster-Shafer theory based trust scheme to protect reputation systems. When tested against real user attack data collected from a cyber competition, the proposed scheme has achieved a very good performance in terms of accurately identifying malicious users. It also demonstrates a great potential to effectively remove dishonest ratings and keep the online reputation system a secure and fair marketplace.", "Feature attribution XAI algorithms enable their users to gain insight into the underlying patterns of large datasets through their feature importance calculation. Existing feature attribution algorithms treat all features in a dataset homogeneously, which may lead to misinterpretation of consequences of changing feature values. In this work, we consider partitioning features into controllable and uncontrollable parts and propose the Controllable fActor Feature Attribution (CAFA) approach to compute the relative importance of controllable features. We carried out experiments applying CAFA to two existing datasets and our own COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical control measures dataset. Experimental results show that with CAFA, we are able to exclude influences from uncontrollable features in our explanation while keeping the full dataset for prediction.", "In this paper, we present an age-friendly E-commerce system with novel assistive functional technologies, aiming at providing a comfortable online shopping environment for the elderly. Besides incorporating human factors for the elderly into the design of user interface, we build an age-friendly system by improving the functional usability. First, to improve the searching experience, we design a multimodal product search function, which accepts image, speech, text and the combination of them as inputs to help the elderly find products easily and accurately. Second, we develop a product reputation function to provide an objective evaluation of products\u2019 quality, which helps the elderly filter out low-quality products while saves their energy in product comparison.

No cure has been found for PD. Therefore, rehabilitation plays an important role in maximizing patients' functions and quality of life for the sake of continuing to lead fulfilling lives. Physical exercise is adopted as an effective means in PD rehabilitation. However, physical exercises need to be conducted intensively over a long period of time to be effective, leading PD patients to feel mentally bored and physically tired. This reduces their motivations to persist in rehabilitation as a result. In this paper, we propose a tablet based game platform for PD rehabilitation, which is able to encourage the patients to keep on rehabilitation exercises.

We further contribute a distributed constraints maintenance framework, in which the solution is encapsulated as a generic engine to be mounted in a variety of single-user UML modeling applications for supporting distributed collaborative UML modeling and distributed constraints maintenance.", "Psychosocially impaired elderly often suffer from functional limitations which impede independent community living. Rehabilitation is the process in which they regain the necessary skills to re-integrate back into the community and can therefore age in place. In this work, we developed a VR psychosocial rehabilitation platform that enables users to perform daily tasks in a high-fidelity virtual environment so that their gained experiences and skills can be applied back in the real-world environment, thus helping them reintegrate back into the community. A food court scenario, a home-based scenario, and a farm scenario were developed. An initial pilot study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of VR as a rehabilitation platform.

Traditional recommender systems are built based on a general consensus that users\u2019 preferences reflect their underlying interests. Therefore, various collaborative filtering techniques have been proposed to discover items that best match users\u2019 preferences through estimating ratings for items accurately. However, determining the interestingness of items based on user preferences alone is not sufficient. In human psychology, researchers have found an important intrinsic motivation, ie, curiosity, for seeking interestingness in social context. Instead of focusing on users\u2019 preferences, curiosity highlights the impact of the unknown and unexpectedness on a person\u2019s feeling of interestingness. In light of this, we propose a novel recommendation model which recommends items by taking consideration of the target users\u00a0\u2026", "Computational Assumption-based Argumentation (CABA) has been introduced to model argumentation with numerical data processing.
