To help resolve these issues, we propose TrustSVD, a trust-based matrix factorization technique. By analyzing the social trust data from four real-world data sets, we conclude that not only the explicit but also the implicit influence of both ratings and trust should be taken into consideration in a recommendation model. Hence, we build on top of a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm SVD++ which inherently involves the explicit and implicit influence of rated items, by further incorporating both the explicit and implicit influence of trusted users on the prediction of items for an active user. To our knowledge, the work reported is the first to extend SVD++ with social trust information. Experimental results on the four data sets demonstrate that our approach TrustSVD achieves better accuracy than other ten counterparts, and can better handle the concerned issues.", "User-based collaborative filtering, a widely used nearest neighbour-based recommendation technique, predicts an item\u2019s rating by aggregating its ratings from similar users. User similarity is traditionally calculated by cosine similarity or the Pearson correlation coefficient. However, both of these measures consider only the direction of rating vectors, and suffer from a range of drawbacks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Bayesian similarity measure based on the Dirichlet distribution, taking into consideration both the direction and length of rating vectors. We posit that not all the rating pairs should be equally counted in order to accurately model user correlation. Three different evidence factors are designed to compute the weights of rating pairs. Further, our principled method reduces correlation due to chance and potential system bias.

Although a plethora of performance metrics have been proposed in the MOO context, there has been a lack of insights on the relationships between metrics. In this paper, we first group the major MOO metrics proposed to date according to four core performance criteria considered in the literature, namely, capacity, convergence, diversity, and convergence-diversity. Then, a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the relationships among representative group metrics, including generational distance, E-indicator (I 1 \u2208+ ), spread (\u0394), generalized spread (\u0394*), inverted generational distance, and hypervolume. Experimental results indicated that these six metrics show high\u00a0\u2026", "Although users' preference is semantically reflected in the free-form review texts, this wealth of information was not fully exploited for learning recommender models.

In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model (called TopicMF) which simultaneously considers the ratings and accompanied review texts. Experimental results on 22 real-world datasets show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness for recommendation tasks.", "There is an urgent need of effective trust management for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), given the dire consequences of acting on false information sent out by malicious peers in this context. In this paper, we first discuss the challenges for trust management caused by the important characteristics of VANET environments.

Based on these studies, we suggest desired properties towards effective trust management in VANETs, setting up clear goals for researchers in this area.", "Providing high quality recommendations is important for e-commerce systems to assist users in making effective selection decisions from a plethora of choices. Collaborative filtering is a widely accepted technique to generate recommendations based on the ratings of like-minded users. However, it suffers from several inherent issues such as data sparsity and cold start. To address these problems, we propose a novel method called \u201cMerge\u201d to incorporate social trust information (i.e., trusted neighbors explicitly specified by users) in providing recommendations. Specifically, ratings of a user\u2019s trusted neighbors are merged to complement and represent the preferences of the user and to find other users with similar preferences (i.e., similar users). In addition, the quality of merged ratings is measured by the confidence considering the number of ratings and the ratio of conflicts between positive and negative opinions\u00a0\u2026", "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have proven to be effective to improve recommendation. Existing methods mainly rely on hand-engineered features from KGs (e.g., meta paths), which requires domain knowledge.

Specifically, RKGE employs a novel recurrent network architecture that contains a batch of recurrent networks to model the semantics of paths linking a same entity pair, which are seamlessly fused into recommendation. It further employs a pooling operator to discriminate the saliency of different paths in characterizing user preferences towards items.

We employ one of the most powerful machine learning methods, ensemble learning, rather than the commonly used method of logistic regression. To assess the performance of fraud prediction models, we introduce a new performance evaluation metric commonly used in ranking problems that is more appropriate for the fraud prediction task.

However, the bottleneck of HV indicator-based MOEAs is the high time complexity for measuring the exact HV contributions of different solutions. To cope with this problem, in this paper, a simple and fast hypervolume indicator-based MOEA (FV-MOEA) is proposed to quickly update the exact HV contributions of different solutions. The core idea of FV-MOEA is that the HV contribution of a solution is only associated with partial solutions rather than the whole solution set. Thus, the time cost of FV-MOEA can be greatly reduced by deleting irrelevant solutions. Experimental studies on 44 benchmark multiobjective optimization problems with 2-5 objectives in platform jMetal demonstrate that FV-MOEA not only\u00a0\u2026", "We propose TrustSVD, a trust-based matrix factorization technique for recommendations.

We propose a novel announcement scheme for VANETs based on a reputation system that allows evaluation of message reliability. We present a secure and efficient scheme that is robust and fault tolerant against temporary unavailability of the central server.", "As the number of vehicles grows rapidly each year, more and more traffic congestion occurs, becoming a big issue for civil engineers in almost all metropolitan cities. In this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based traffic management framework for reducing traffic congestion, which unifies the strategies of both dynamic vehicle rerouting and traffic light control. Specifically, each vehicle, represented as an agent, deposits digital pheromones over its route, while roadside infrastructure agents collect the pheromones and fuse them to evaluate real-time traffic conditions as well as to predict expected road congestion levels in near future. Once road congestion is predicted, a proactive vehicle rerouting strategy based on global distance and local pheromone is employed to assign alternative routes to selected vehicles before they enter congested roads.

However, the design of effective PDRs is a tedious task, requiring a myriad of specialized knowledge and often delivering limited performance. In this paper, we propose to automatically learn PDRs via an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent. We exploit the disjunctive graph representation of JSSP, and propose a Graph Neural Network based scheme to embed the states encountered during solving. The resulting policy network is size-agnostic, effectively enabling generalization on large-scale instances. Experiments show that the agent can learn high-quality PDRs from scratch with elementary raw features, and demonstrates strong performance against the best existing PDRs. The learned policies also perform well on much larger instances that are unseen in training.", "Although demonstrated to be efficient and scalable to large-scale data sets, clustering-based recommender systems suffer from relatively low accuracy and coverage. To address these issues, we develop a multiview clustering method through which users are iteratively clustered from the views of both rating patterns and social trust relationships. To accommodate users who appear in two different clusters simultaneously, we employ a support vector regression model to determine a prediction for a given item, based on user-, item- and prediction-related features. To accommodate (cold) users who cannot be clustered due to insufficient data, we propose a probabilistic method to derive a prediction from the views of both ratings and trust relationships.

Empirical analysis, on recently crawled product reviews from a popular Chinese e-commerce website, reveals the failure of many state-of-the-art spam indicators on detecting collusive spammers. Two novel methods are then proposed: 1) a KNN-based method that considers the pairwise similarity of two reviewers based on their group-level relational information and selects k most similar reviewers for voting; 2) a more general graph-based classification method that jointly classifies a set of reviewers based on their pairwise transaction correlations. Experimental results show that both our methods promisingly outperform the indicator-only classifiers in various settings.", "In this paper, we present a model for evaluating the trustworthiness of advice about seller agents in electronic marketplaces. In particular, we propose a novel personalized approach for effectively handling unfair ratings of sellers provided to buyer agents from other buyers (called advisors). Our approach offers flexibility for buyers to weight their value for private and public knowledge about advisors. A personalized approach is proposed as well for buyers to model the trustworthiness of sellers, based on the advice provided. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively model trustworthiness for both advisors and sellers, even when there are large numbers of unfair ratings.", "Trust is one source of information that has been widely adopted to personalize online services for users, such as in product recommendations.

To narrow this gap, we propose a principled approach that predicts implicit trust from users' interactions, by extending a well-known trust antecedents framework. Specifically, we consider both local and global trustworthiness of target users, and form a personalized trust metric by further taking into account the active user's propensity to trust. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our approach works better than contemporary counterparts in terms of trust ranking performance when direct user interactions are limited.", null, "Recommender systems have become an essential tool to help resolve the information overload problem in recent decades. Traditional recommender systems, however, suffer from data sparsity and cold start problems.

This Research Commentary aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on recommender systems with side information.

The average of these estimated feature ratings also better represents an accurate overall rating for the feature of the service, which provides useful feedback for other users to choose their satisfactory services.", "Online reviews, as one kind of quality indicator of products or service, are becoming increasingly important in influencing purchase decisions of prospective consumers on electronic commerce websites.

In this paper, we conduct two empirical studies on online reviews. Firstly, we study how culture differences across countries (i.e., China and the USA) impact the way in which consumers provide online reviews. Secondly, we investigate the impact of online reviews on product sales in the Chinese context, and show that directly copying the ideas of successful online review systems in the USA will deteriorate the effectiveness of the systems in China.

In particular, we define a trust model that allows each IDS to evaluate the trustworthiness of others based on personal experience. We prove the correctness of our approach in protecting the IDN. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate that our system yields a significant improvement in detecting intrusions. The trust model further improves the robustness of the collaborative system against malicious attacks.", "Trust has been extensively studied and its effectiveness demonstrated in recommender systems. Due to the lack of explicit trust information in most systems, many trust metric approaches have been proposed to infer implicit trust from user ratings. However, previous works have not compared these different approaches, and oftentimes focus only on the performance of predictive item ratings. In this paper, we first analyse five kinds of trust metrics in light of the properties of trust. We conduct an empirical study to explore the ability of trust metrics to distinguish explicit trust from implicit trust and to generate accurate predictions. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that existing trust metrics cannot provide satisfying performance, and indicate that future metrics should be designed more carefully.", "This paper aims at solving the stochastic shortest path problem in vehicle routing, the objective of which is to determine an optimal path that maximizes the probability of arriving at the destination before a given deadline. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven approach, which directly explores the big data generated in traffic. Specifically, we first reformulate the original shortest path problem as a cardinality minimization problem directly based on samples of travel time on each road link, which can be obtained from the GPS trajectory of vehicles. Then, we apply an \u2113 1 -norm minimization technique and its variants to solve the cardinality problem.

Unfortunately, this kind of technique consumes much energy and hence largely limits the lifespan of WSN. Although the state-of-the-art studies have realized the importance of trust systems' efficiency in WSNs and proposed several preliminary solutions, they have overlooked to optimize the watchdog technique, which is perhaps among the top energy-consuming units. In this paper, we reveal the inefficient use of watchdog technique in existing trust systems, and thereby propose a suite of optimization methods to minimize the energy cost of watchdog usage, while keeping the system's security in a sufficient level. Our contributions consist of theoretical analyses and practical algorithms, which can efficiently and effectively schedule the watchdog tasks depending on the sensor\u00a0\u2026", "Many trust-aware recommender systems have explored the value of explicit trust, which is specified by users with binary values and simply treated as a concept with a single aspect. However, in social science, trust is known as a complex term with multiple facets, which has not been well exploited in prior recommender systems. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by proposing a (dis)trust framework with considerations of both interpersonal and impersonal aspects of trust and distrust. Specifically, four interpersonal aspects (benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability) are computationally modeled based on users' historic ratings, while impersonal aspects are formulated from the perspective of user connections in trust networks. Two logistic regression models are developed and trained by accommodating these factors, and then applied to predict continuous values of users' trust and distrust\u00a0\u2026", "Security is oftentimes centrally managed. An alternative trend of using collaboration in order to improve security has gained momentum over the past few years. Collaborative security is an abstract concept that applies to a wide variety of systems and has been used to solve security issues inherent in distributed environments. Thus far, collaboration has been used in many domains such as intrusion detection, spam filtering, botnet resistance, and vulnerability detection. In this survey, we focus on different mechanisms of collaboration and defense in collaborative security. We systematically investigate numerous use cases of collaborative security by covering six types of security systems. Aspects of these systems are thoroughly studied, including their technologies, standards, frameworks, strengths and weaknesses.

In addition, we propose an Embedding Glimpse layer in MDAM based on the recursive nature of construction, which can improve the quality of each policy by providing more informative embeddings.

One method for representing reputation is to ask other agents in the system (called advisor agents) to provide ratings of the seller agents. The problem of unfair ratings exists in almost every reputation system, including both unfairly high and unfairly low ratings. We begin by surveying some existing approaches to this problem, characterizing their capabilities and categorizing them in terms of two main dimensions: public-private and global-local. The impact of reputation system architectures on approach selection is also discussed. Based on the study, we propose a novel personalized approach for effectively handling unfair ratings in an enhanced centralized reputation system.

We then combine different features with an evolutionary algorithm, in which way we evolve malware for variants. Previous results have shown that the existing AMTs only exhibit detection rate of 20%-30% for 10 000 evolved malware variants.

However, most existing trust-based approaches are designed for the recommendation task of rating prediction. Only few trust-aware methods have attempted to recommend users an ordered list of interesting items, i.e., item recommendation. In this article, we propose three factored similarity models with the incorporation of social trust for item recommendation based on implicit user feedback. Specifically, we introduce a matrix factorization technique to recover user preferences between rated items and unrated ones in the light of both user-user and item-item similarities. In addition, we claim that social trust relationships also have an important impact on a user\u2019s preference for a specific item.

Currently, most of existing malware detection solutions are individually proposed to address certain types of attacks or certain evasion techniques. Thus, it is desired to conduct a systematic investigation and evaluation of anti-malware solutions and tools based on different attacks and evasion techniques. In this paper, we first propose a meta model for Android malware to capture the common attack features and evasion features in the malware. Based on this model, we develop a framework, MYSTIQUE, to automatically generate malware covering four attack features and two evasion features, by adopting the software product line engineering approach.

It shows that DSA can capture the common malicious behaviors of a malware family, as well as the malware variants. Based on DSA, we develop an automatic analysis framework, named SMART, which learns DSA by detecting and summarizing semantic clones from malware families, and then extracts semantic features from the learned DSA to classify malware according to the attack patterns.

More specifically, our trust-based message propagation model collects and propagates peers' opinions in an efficient, secure and scalable way by dynamically controlling information dissemination. The trust-based message evaluation model allows peers to evaluate the information in a distributed and collaborative fashion by taking into account others' opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework promotes network scalability and system effectiveness in information evaluation under the pervasive presence of false information, which are the two essentially important factors for the popularization of vehicular networks.", "Most existing studies on next location recommendation propose to model the sequential regularity of check-in sequences, but suffer from the severe data sparsity issue where most locations have fewer than five following locations. To this end, we propose an Attentional Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN) to jointly model both the sequential regularity and transition regularities of similar locations (neighbors). In particular, we first design a meta-path based random walk over a novel knowledge graph to discover location neighbors based on heterogeneous factors. A recurrent neural network is then adopted to model the sequential regularity by capturing various contexts that govern user mobility. Meanwhile, the transition regularities of the discovered neighbors are integrated via the attention mechanism, which seamlessly cooperates with the sequential regularity as a unified recurrent framework. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ARNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have proven to be effective for high-quality recommendation, where the connectivities between users and items provide rich and complementary information to user-item interactions. Most existing methods, however, are insufficient to exploit the KGs for capturing user preferences, as they either represent the user-item connectivities via paths with limited expressiveness or implicitly model them by propagating information over the entire KG with inevitable noise. In this paper, we design a novel hierarchical attentive knowledge graph embedding (HAKG) framework to exploit the KGs for effective recommendation. Specifically, HAKG first extracts the expressive subgraphs that link user-item pairs to characterize their connectivities, which accommodate both the semantics and topology of KGs.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results of our approach in filtering various types of unfair testimonies.", "Given the rapid growth of participatory media content such as blogs, there is a need to design personalized recommender systems to recommend only useful content to users. We believe that in addition to producing useful recommendations, certain insights from media research such as simplification and opinion diversity in recommendations should form the foundations of such recommender systems, so that the behavior of the systems can be understood more closely, and modified if necessary. We propose and evaluate such a system based on a Bayesian user-model. We use the underlying social network of blog authors and readers to model the preference features for individual users. The initial results of our proposed solution are encouraging, and set the agenda for future research.", "Capturing the temporal dynamics of user preferences over items is important for recommendation. Existing methods mainly assume that all time steps in user-item interaction history are equally relevant to recommendation, which however does not apply in real-world scenarios where user-item interactions can often happen accidentally. More importantly, they learn user and item dynamics separately, thus failing to capture their joint effects on user-item interactions. To better model user and item dynamics, we present the Interacting Attention-gated Recurrent Network (IARN) which adopts the attention model to measure the relevance of each time step. In particular, we propose a novel attention scheme to learn the attention scores of user and item history in an interacting way, thus to account for the dependencies between user and item dynamics in shaping user-item interactions. By doing so, IARN can selectively\u00a0\u2026", "We present NeuroLKH, a novel algorithm that combines deep learning with the strong traditional heuristic Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) for solving Traveling Salesman Problem. Specifically, we train a Sparse Graph Network (SGN) with supervised learning for edge scores and unsupervised learning for node penalties, both of which are critical for improving the performance of LKH. Based on the output of SGN, NeuroLKH creates the edge candidate set and transforms edge distances to guide the searching process of LKH. Extensive experiments firmly demonstrate that, by training one model on a wide range of problem sizes, NeuroLKH significantly outperforms LKH and generalizes well to much larger sizes. Also, we show that NeuroLKH can be applied to other routing problems such as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP), and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW).", "There is a need for robust and effective trust management. Different security problems result in different requirements to the design of trust management, and the existing attacks in trust management for security are yet to be solved. In this paper, we first propose a framework to classify desired properties of trust management for each type of security problems. We then investigate typical representative attacks and existing solutions in trust management for security. By considering both these security properties and attacks on trust management systems, our work serves to propel the design of more effective and robust trust management systems for security.", "The increasing number of service providers on the Web makes it challenging to select a provider for a specific service demand. Each service consumer has different expectations for a given service in different contexts, so the selection process should be consumer\u2010oriented and context\u2010dependent. Current approaches for service selection typically have consumers receive ratings of providers from other consumers, where the ratings reflect the consumers' overall subjective opinions. This may be misleading if consumers have different contexts and satisfaction criteria. In this paper, we propose that consumers objectively record their experiences, using an ontology to capture subtle details. This can then be interpreted by consumers according to their own criteria and contexts. We then integrate a method for addressing consumers who lie about their experiences, filtering them out during service selection.

While candidate solutions, such as incentive mechanisms and data mining have been well explored in the literature, the power of crowds has been largely overlooked or under-exploited. In this paper, we propose a cross validation approach which seeks a validating crowd to ratify the contributing crowd in terms of the sensor data contributed by the latter, and uses the validation result to reshape data into a more credible posterior belief of the ground truth. This approach consists of a framework and a mechanism, where the framework outlines a four-step procedure and the mechanism implements it with specific technical components, including a weighted random oversampling (WRoS) technique and a privacy-aware trust-oriented probabilistic push (PATOP 2\u00a0\u2026", "Web usage mining plays an important role in the personalization of Web services, adaptation of Web sites, and the improvement of Web server performance. It applies data mining techniques to discover Web access patterns from Web usage data. In order to discover access patterns, Web usage data should be reconstructed into sessions with or without user identification. However, not all Web server logs contain complete information for constructing user sessions. One approach for solving such a problem is to use time-oriented heuristics to reconstruct user sessions. The paper describes improved statistical-based time-oriented heuristics for the reconstruction of user sessions from a server log. Comparative analyses are carried out using two similarity measures. The performance results of the proposed improved heuristics are promising and in some cases show reasonable improvements.", "Online review fraud has evolved in sophistication by launching intelligent campaigns where a group of coordinated participants work together to deliver deceptive reviews for the designated targets. Such collusive fraud is considered much harder to defend against as these campaign participants are capable of evading detection by shaping their behaviors collectively so as not to appear suspicious. The present work complements existing studies by exploring more subtle behavioral trails connected with collusive review fraud. A novel statistical model is proposed to further characterize, recognize, and forecast collusive fraud in online reviews. The proposed model is completely unsupervised, which bypasses the difficulty of manual annotation required for supervised modeling. It is also highly flexible to incorporate collusion characteristics available for better modeling and prediction.

The goal is to manipulate perceived reputations of the targets for their best interests. Many efforts have been made to detect such colluders by extracting pointwise features from individual reviewers/reviewer-groups, however, pairwise features which can potentially capture the underlying correlations among colluders are either ignored or just explored insufficiently in the literature. We observed that pairwise features can be more robust to model the relationships among colluders since they, as the ingredients of spam campaigns, are correlated in nature. In this paper, we explore multiple heterogeneous pairwise features in virtue of some collusion signals found\u00a0\u2026", "In reputation systems for multiagent-based e-marketplaces, buying agents model the reputation of selling agents based on ratings shared by other buyers (called advisors). With the existence of unfair rating attacks from dishonest advisors, the effectiveness of reputation systems thus heavily relies on whether buyers can accurately determine which advisors to include in trust networks and their trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent evolutionary trust model (MET) where each buyer evolves its trust network. In each generation, each buyer acquires trust network information from its advisors and generates a candidate trust network using evolutionary operators. Only trust networks providing more accurate seller reputation estimation shall survive to the next generation. Experimental results demonstrate MET is more robust than the state-ofthe-art trust models against various unfair rating attacks.", "More realistic than deterministic vehicle routing, stochastic vehicle routing considers uncertainties in traffic. Its two representative optimization models are the probability tail (PT) and the stochastic shortest path problem with delay excess penalty (SSPD), which can be approximately solved by expressing them as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The traditional method to solve these two MILP problems, i.e., branch and bound (B&B), suffers from exponential computation complexity because of integer constraints. To overcome this computation inefficiency, we propose a partial Lagrange multiplier method. It benefits from the total unimodularity of the incidence matrix in the models, which guarantees an optimal integer solution by only solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Thus, this partial Lagrange multiplier problem can be further solved using the subgradient method, and the proposed\u00a0\u2026", "Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) intrinsically cope with a homogeneous vehicle fleet, in which the fleet is assumed as repetitions of a single vehicle. Hence, their key to construct a solution solely lies in the selection of the next node (customer) to visit excluding the selection of vehicle. However, vehicles in real-world scenarios are likely to be heterogeneous with different characteristics that affect their capacity (or travel speed), rendering existing DRL methods less effective. In this article, we tackle heterogeneous CVRP (HCVRP), where vehicles are mainly characterized by different capacities. We consider both min\u2013max and min\u2013sum objectives for HCVRP, which aim to minimize the longest or total travel time of the vehicle(s) in the fleet. To solve those problems, we propose a DRL method based on the attention mechanism with a\u00a0\u2026", "In electronic marketplaces, after each transaction buyers will rate the products provided by the sellers. To decide the most trustworthy sellers to transact with, buyers rely on trust models to leverage these ratings to evaluate the reputation of sellers. Although the high effectiveness of different trust models for handling unfair ratings have been claimed by their designers, recently it is argued that these models are vulnerable to more intelligent attacks, and there is an urgent demand that the robustness of the existing trust models has to be evaluated in a more comprehensive way. In this work, we classify the existing trust models into two broad categories and propose an extendable e-marketplace testbed to evaluate their robustness against different unfair rating attacks comprehensively.

To address this challenging issue, we leverage a novel neural network integrated with a heterogeneous attention mechanism to empower the policy in deep reinforcement learning to automatically select the nodes. In particular, the heterogeneous attention mechanism specifically prescribes attentions for each role of the nodes while taking into account the precedence constraint, i.e., the pickup node must precede the pairing delivery node. Further integrated with a masking scheme, the learnt policy is expected to find higher-quality solutions for solving PDP\u00a0\u2026", "Routing problems are very important in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, a number of deep learning-based methods are proposed to automatically learn construction heuristics for solving routing problems. However, these methods do not completely follow Bellman's Principle of Optimality since the visited nodes during construction are still included in the following subtasks, resulting in suboptimal policies. In this article, we propose a novel step-wise scheme which explicitly removes the visited nodes in each node selection step. We apply this scheme to two representative deep models for routing problems, pointer network and transformer attention model (TAM), and significantly improve the performance of the original models. To reduce computational complexity, we further propose the approximate step-wise TAM model by modifying one layer of attention.

Existing methods based on the probability tail model seek for the path that maximizes the probability of arriving at the destination before a deadline. However, they suffer from low accuracy and/or high computational cost. We design a novel Q-learning method where the converged Q-values have the practical meaning as the actual probabilities of arriving on time so as to improve accuracy. By further adopting dynamic neural networks to learn the value function, our method can scale well to large road networks with arbitrary deadlines. Experimental results on real road networks demonstrate the significant advantages of our method over other counterparts.", "In this paper, we present a trust\u2010modeling framework for message propagation and evaluation in vehicular ad hoc networks.

The trust\u2010based message evaluation model allows peers to derive a local action decision about whether to follow the information by evaluating the information in a distributed and collaborative fashion while taking into account others' opinions.

One method for representing reputation is to ask other agents in the system (called advisor agents) to provide ratings of the provider agents. The problem of unfair ratings exists in almost every reputation system, including both unfairly high and unfairly low ratings. We begin by surveying some existing approaches to this problem, characterizing their capabilities and categorizing them in terms of two main dimensions: public-private and global-local. The impact of reputation system architectures on approach selection is also discussed. Based on the study, we propose a novel personalized approach for effectively handling unfair ratings in an enhanced centralized reputation system. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach effectively adjusts the trustworthiness of advisor agents according to the percentages of unfair ratings provided by them. We then argue for the merits of our model as the basis for designing social networks to share reputation ratings of providers in multiagent systems.", "In this paper we introduce a multi-faceted trust model of use for the application of ad-hoc vehicular networks (VANETs) - scenarios where agents representing drivers exchange information with other drivers regarding road and traffic conditions. We argue that there is a need to model trust in various dimensions and that combining these elements effectively can assist agents in making transportation decisions. We then introduce two new elements to our proposed model: i) distinguishing direct and indirect reports that are shared ii) employing a penalty for misleading reports, to promote honesty. We demonstrate how these two elements together serve to increase the value of the trust model, through a series of experiments of simulated traffic. In brief, we present a framework to facilitate the effective sharing of information in VANET environments between agents representing the vehicles.", "In this paper, we explore the use of the web as an environment for electronic commerce. In particular, we develop a novel mechanism that creates incentives for honesty in electronic marketplaces where human users are represented by buying and selling agents. In our mechanism, buyers model other buyers and select the most trustworthy ones as their neighbors from which they can ask advice about sellers. In addition, however, sellers model the reputation of buyers. Reputable buyers provide fair ratings of sellers, and are likely to be neighbors of many other buyers. Sellers will provide more attractive products to reputable buyers, in order to build their reputation. We discuss how a marketplace operating with our mechanism leads to better profit both for honest buyers and sellers.

Familiarity is often considered to be an important factor in determining the level of trust. In previous research, familiarity between two agents has been simply assumed to be the similarity between them.

Prior ratings are based on users\u2019 experiences of virtual products in a mediated environment, and they can be submitted prior to purchase. A conceptual model of prior ratings is proposed, integrating the environmental factor presence whose effects on product evaluation have not been studied previously.

We thus adopt and extend the probability tail model that aims to maximize the probability of reaching destinations before deadlines. Specifically, we propose a decentralized multiagent approach, where infrastructure agents locally collect intentions of concerned vehicle agents and formulate route guidance as a route assignment problem, to guarantee their arrival on time. Experimental results on real road networks justify its ability to increase the chance of arrival on time.", "This work aims at measuring familiarity to con-tribute to the formalization of trust. Trust has always been bundled with familiarity to become a popular topic in the areas of psychology, sociology and computer science. Correlation between familiarity and trust has been explored and proved by many studies from different perspectives. A new model of trust has been proposed by Carter and Ghorbani to formalize the value-centric trust in agent societies. However, the measurement of familiarity in their work is roughly the similarity of values between two agents. Familiarity measurements proposed by other researchers are not convenient due to the instability and abstruseness of familiarity, or are useful only in certain circumstances and are quite problem-specific. We propose a convenient way of measuring familiarity with a Web site and continuously updating its value based on the exploration of factors that may affect familiarity. The five major factors include prior experience, repeated exposure, study duration, level of processing and forgetting rate. The human factors are mapped to the properties of Web application domain through a factors hierarchy. Experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed measurement are discussed in the future work section.", "For many real-world applications, predicting a price range is more practical and desirable than predicting a concrete value. In this case, price prediction can be regarded as a classification problem. Although deep forest is recognized as the best solution to many classification problems, a crucial issue limits its direct application to price prediction, i.e., it treated all the misclassifications equally no matter how far away they are from the real classes, since their impacts on the accuracy are the same. This is unreasonable to price prediction as the misclassification should be as close to the real price range as possible even if they have to be wrongly classified. To address this issue, we propose a cost-sensitive deep forest for price prediction, which maintains the high accuracy of deep forest, and propels the misclassifications to be closer to the real price range to reduce the cost of misclassifications.

The focus is on developing an approach for buyers to model the trustworthiness of sellers in order to make effective decisions about which sellers to select for business. One challenge is the problem of unfair ratings, which arises when modeling the trust of sellers relies on ratings provided by other buyers (called advisors). Existing approaches for coping with this problem fail in scenarios where the majority of advisors are dishonest, buyers do not have much personal experience with sellers, advisors try to flood the trust modeling system with unfair ratings, and sellers vary their behavior widely. We propose a novel personalized approach for effectively modeling trustworthiness of advisors, allowing a buyer to 1) model the private reputation of an advisor based on their ratings for commonly rated sellers 2) model the public reputation of the advisor based on all ratings for the sellers ever rated by that agent 3) flexibly weight the private and public reputation into one combined measure of the trustworthiness of the advisor. Our approach tracks ratings provided according to their time windows and limits the ratings accepted, in order to cope with advisors flooding the system and to deal with changes in agents' behavior.

As the quality of opinions may vary, it is important for users to evaluate opinions in order to determine how much to rely on. In this paper, we propose a novel trust model stemmed from the diffusion theory in social science (called DiffTrust), to evaluate the opinions of users (referred to as advisors) by modeling their trustworthiness. Specifically, an advisor\u2019s trust building among users is considered as a diffusion process. Her trustworthiness perceived by a specific user is influenced by four important factors including the advisor\u2019s characteristics directly observed by the user, susceptibility of the user, the contagious influence of other users already having a certain level of trust on the advisor, and the environment. DiffTrust also emphasizes on the dynamics of trust. Experimental results based on four real datasets verify the effectiveness of our model in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.", "Social networks are fundamental to virtual communities (e.g., forums, blogs) and virtual communities benefit from well-established social networks. As making friends with other members is a common way to establish social relationships and people need to decide whom they should trust when making friends, friend recommendation has received considerable attention in virtual communities. Towards this goal, we first formulate hypotheses on factors that influence trust and the probability of establishing friendships from various interaction attributes in virtual communities. Through experiments on real interaction and friendship data, we validate the proposed hypotheses and propose a novel interaction ranking-based trustworthy friend recommendation model called IntRank for recommending trustworthy friends to community members. Different from traditional friend recommendation mechanisms, IntRank is built on\u00a0\u2026", "Recommender models are hard to evaluate, particularly under offline setting. In this article, we provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the data leakage issue in recommender system offline evaluation. Data leakage is caused by not observing global timeline in evaluating recommenders e.g., train/test data split does not follow global timeline. As a result, a model learns from the user-item interactions that are not expected to be available at the prediction time. We first show the temporal dynamics of user-item interactions along global timeline, then explain why data leakage exists for collaborative filtering models. Through carefully designed experiments, we show that all models indeed recommend future items that are not available at the time point of a test instance, as the result of data leakage. The experiments are conducted with four widely used baseline models\u2014BPR, NeuMF, SASRec, and LightGCN, on\u00a0\u2026", "Stereotypical trust modeling can be adopted by a buyer to effectively evaluate trustworthiness of a seller who has little or no past experience in e-marketplaces. The buyer forms trust stereotypes based on her past experience with other sellers. However, when the buyer has limited past experience with sellers, the formed stereotypes cannot accurately reflect her trust evaluation towards sellers. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized stereotypical trust model. Specifically, we first build a semantic ontology to represent hierarchical relationships among seller attribute values. We then propose a fuzzy semantic decision tree (FSDT) learning method to construct trust stereotypes that generalizes over seller non-nominal attributes by splitting their values in a fuzzy manner, and generalizes over nominal attributes by replacing their specific values with more general terms according to the ontology\u00a0\u2026", "In multi-agent systems, stereotypical trust models are widely used to bootstrap a priori trust in case historical trust evidences are unavailable. These models can work well if and only if malicious agents share some common features (i.e., stereotypes) in their profiles and these features can be detected. However, this condition may not hold for all the adversarial scenarios. Smart attackers can show different trustworthiness to different agents and services (i.e., launching context-correlated attacks). In this paper, we propose CAST, a novel Context-Aware Stereotypical Trust deep learning framework. CAST coins a comprehensive set of seven context-aware stereotypes, each of which can capture a unique type of context-correlated attacks, as well as a deep learning architecture to keep the trust stereotyping robust (i.e., resist training errors). The basic idea is to construct a multi-layer perceptive structure to learn the latent\u00a0\u2026", "Evaluation of the effectiveness and robustness of reputation systems is important for the trust research community. However, existing testbeds are mainly simulation based and not flexible to perform robustness evaluation, and none of them is specifically designed to evaluate the robustness of reputation systems against unfair rating attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive testbed by simulating three types of environments (simulated environments, real environments with simulated unfair rating attacks, and real environments with detected unfair ratings). The testbed incorporates sophisticated deception models and unfair rating attack models, and introduces several performance metrics to fully test and compare the effectiveness and robustness of different reputation systems. We also provide two case studies to demonstrate the usage of partial features of our proposed testbed.", "Opinion Maximization (OM) aims at determining a small set of influential individuals, spreading the expected opinions of an object (e.g., product or individual) to their neighbors through the social relationships and eventually producing the largest rational opinion spread. In previous studies, once the corresponding nodes are activated, their opinions usually keep unchanged, which fails to capture the real scenarios where the opinion of each node on the object can dynamically change over time. In this view, we propose a Dynamic Opinion Maximization Framework (DOMF) to settle the OM problem, which consists of two parts: dynamic opinion formation and adaptive seeding process. Specifically, we formulate the OM problem by maximizing rational opinions, and prove that: 1) the OM problem within a constant ratio is NP-hard, and 2) the objective function does not satisfy the monotonicity and submodularity\u00a0\u2026", "Web service composition is a process to compose homogenous or heterogeneous services together in order to create value-added services. Many non-functional features including QoS and user preferences have been adopted to guide such a process. However, two issues are observed: (1) the expressiveness of user preference is subject to quantitative preferences without proper use of qualitative preferences; (2) a highly preferred composite service may not be trustworthy, or a highly trustworthy composite service may not be preferable. The existing studies concentrate on either user preference or service trust, and fail to provide a systematic solution to integrate both user preference and service trust together for service compositions. To address these issues, we combine both qualitative and quantitative preferences as well as service trust together in the process of service composition. We investigate the\u00a0\u2026", "Backtracking search algorithms are often used to solve the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), which is widely applied in various domains such as automated planning and scheduling. The efficiency of backtracking search depends greatly on the variable ordering heuristics. Currently, the most commonly used heuristics are hand-crafted based on expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based approach to automatically discover new variable ordering heuristics that are better adapted for a given class of CSP instances, without the need of relying on hand-crafted features and heuristics. We show that directly optimizing the search tree size is not convenient for learning, and propose to optimize the expected cost of reaching a leaf node in the search tree. To capture the complex relations among the variables and constraints, we design a representation scheme based on Graph\u00a0\u2026", "Incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing are designed to incentivize financially self-interested workers to generate and report high-quality labels. Existing mechanisms are often developed as one-shot static solutions, assuming a certain level of knowledge about worker models (expertise levels, costs for exerting efforts, etc.). In this paper, we propose a novel inference aided reinforcement mechanism that acquires data sequentially and requires no such prior assumptions. Specifically, we first design a Gibbs sampling augmented Bayesian inference algorithm to estimate workers' labeling strategies from the collected labels at each step. Then we propose a reinforcement incentive learning (RIL) method, building on top of the above estimates, to uncover how workers respond to different payments. RIL dynamically determines the payment without accessing any ground-truth labels. We theoretically prove that RIL is able to incentivize rational workers to provide high-quality labels both at each step and in the long run. Empirical results show that our mechanism performs consistently well under both rational and non-fully rational (adaptive learning) worker models. Besides, the payments offered by RIL are more robust and have lower variances compared to existing one-shot mechanisms.", "Existing feature-based recommendation methods incorporate auxiliary features about users and/or items to address data sparsity and cold start issues. They mainly consider features that are organized in a flat structure, where features are independent and in a same level. However, auxiliary features are often organized in rich knowledge structures (e.g. hierarchy) to describe their relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization framework with recursive regularization -- ReMF, which jointly models and learns the influence of hierarchically-organized features on user-item interactions, thus to improve recommendation accuracy. It also provides characterization of how different features in the hierarchy co-influence the modeling of user-item interactions. Empirical results on real-world data sets demonstrate that ReMF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feature-based recommendation methods.", "The Android ecosystem has recently dominated mobile devices. Android app markets, including official Google Play and other third party markets, are becoming hotbeds, where malware originates and spreads. Android malware has been observed to both propagate within markets and spread between markets. If the spread of Android malware between markets can be predicted, market administrators can take appropriate measures to prevent the outbreak of malware and minimize the damages caused by malware. In this paper, we make the first attempt to protect the Android ecosystem by modeling and predicting the spread of Android malware between markets. To this end, we study the social behaviors that affect the spread of malware, model these spread behaviors with multiple epidemic models, and predict the infection time and order among markets for well-known malware families.

However, the value of RL for recommendation has not reached the full potential due to two major drawbacks: 1) recommendation is modeled as a rating prediction problem but should essentially be a personalized ranking one; 2) multi-level organizations of items are neglected for fine-grained item relationships. We design a unified Bayesian framework MRLR to learn user and item embeddings from a multi-level item organization, thus benefiting from RL as well as achieving the goal of personalized ranking. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that MRLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "Current deployed reputation systems simply aggregate numerical ratings provided by buyers, but overlook the buyers\u2019 subjectivity difference in evaluating the transactions with a seller. To address this problem, we propose a subjectivity alignment approach for reputation computation (SARC).", "In this paper we focus on the architecture, design and implementation of a generic user modeling server for adaptive web systems (GUMSAWS), reaching the goals of generality, extendability and replaceability. GUMSAWS acts as a centralized user modeling server to assist several adaptive Web systems (possibly in different domains) concurrently. It incrementally builds up user models, provides functions of storing, updating and deleting entries in user profiles, and maintains consistency of user models. Our system is also able to infer missing entries in user profiles from different information sources, including direct information, groups information, association rules and general facts. We further evaluate its inference performance within the context of e-commerce. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of inferring user missing property values from different information resources is found to be almost 70\u00a0\u2026", "Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used to learn informative latent representations of users and items from observed interactions. Existing CF-based methods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That is, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved pairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined distribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is computationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled under the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed positive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled from the training dataset could be positive in the test set. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL), has emerged as a powerful tool to learn a model without negative samples. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised collaborative\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we introduce a framework for modeling the trustworthiness of peers in the setting of online social networks. In these contexts, it may be important to be filtering the wealth of messages that have been sent, which form the ongoing communication within a large community of users. This is achieved by constructing an intelligent agent that reasons about the message and each peer rater of the message, learning over time to properly gage whether a message is good or bad to show a user, based on message ratings, rater similarity, and rater credibility. Our approach employs a partially observable Markov decision process for trust modeling, moving beyond the more traditional adoption of probabilistic reasoning using beta reputation functions. In addition to outlining the technique in full, we present empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, both in simulations featuring head to head\u00a0\u2026", "Unfair rating attacks to trust systems can affect the accuracy of trust evaluation when trust ratings (recommendations) about trustee agents are sought by truster agents from others (advisor agents). A robust trust system should remain accurate, even under the worst-case attacks which yield the least useful recommendations. In this work, we base on information theory to quantify the utility of recommendations. We analyse models where the advisors have the worst-case behaviour. With these models, we formally prove that if the fraction of dishonest advisors exceeds a certain threshold, recommendations become completely useless (in the worst case). Our evaluations on several popular trust models show that they cannot provide accurate trust evaluation under the worst-case as well as many other types of unfair rating attacks. Our way of explicitly modelling dishonest advisors induces a method of computing trust accurately, which can serve to improve the robustness of the trust models.", "Selecting a seller in e-markets is a tedious task that we might want to delegate to an agent. Many approaches to constructing such agents have been proposed, building upon different foundations (decision theory, trust modeling) and making use of different information (direct experience with sellers, reputation of sellers, trustworthiness of other buyers called advisors, etc.). In this paper, we propose the SALE POMDP, a new approach based on the decision-theoretic framework of POMDPs. It enables optimal trade-offs of information gaining and exploiting actions, with the ultimate goal of maximizing buyer satisfaction. A unique feature of the model is that it allows querying advisors about the trustworthiness of other advisors. We represent the model as a factored POMDP, thereby enabling the use of computationally more efficient solution methods. Evaluation on the ART testbed demonstrates that SALE POMDP balances the cost of obtaining and benefit of more information more effectively, leading to more earnings, than traditional trust models. Experiments also show that it is more robust to deceptive advisors than a previous POMDP based approach, and that the factored formulation allows the solution of reasonably large instances of seller selection problems.", "In an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for optimization problems, candidate solutions to the problems are individuals in a population. They produce offsprings by taking evolutionary operators with user-specific control parameters. The challenge is then how to effectively select evolutionary operators and adjust control parameters from generation to generation and on different problems. We propose a novel multiagent evolutionary framework based on trust where each solution is represented as an intelligent agent, and evolutionary operators and control parameters are represented as services. Agents select services in each generation based on trust that measures the competency or suitability of the services for solving particular problems. Multiobjective Optimization Problems (MOPs) are used to showcase the value of our framework. Experimental studies on 35 benchmark MOPs show that our framework significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art EAs.", "IoT data exchange plays a vital role in supporting various applications and services with massive IoT devices. However, the existence of malicious devices threatens the integrity and reliability of the exchanged data. Trust management has been used to mitigate the impact of malicious devices in centralized and decentralized architectures. However, most of these traditional trust management systems bear computation, storage, and communication challenges. In this study, we propose a semi-centralized trust management system architecture based on blockchain in both single and multiple domains. The IoT devices are centralized organized by cloud servers who coordinately sustain a rating data ledger within each domain based the proposed rotation based consensus protocol in a decentralized manner to support cross-domain data exchange.

Unlike the existing approaches, MUSE-RNN offers special treatment towards capturing temporal aspects of data stream through its novel recurrent learning approach based on the teacher forcing policy. Novelties here are twofold. First, in contrast to the traditional RNN models, MUSE-RNN has intrinsic ability to self-adjust its capacity by growing and pruning hidden nodes as well as layers, to handle the ever-changing characteristics of data stream. Second, MUSERNN adopts a unique scoring-based layer adaptation mechanism, which makes it capable of recalling prior tasks, with minimum exploitation of network parameters. The performance of MUSERNN is evaluated in comparison with a number of state-of-theart techniques, using seven popular data streams and continual\u00a0\u2026", "We propose a pheromone-based traffic management model, which simultaneously optimizes vehicle re-routing and traffic light control. Specifically, each car agent deposits multiple digital pheromone on its route. The road infrastructure agents fuse the pheromone to forecast traffic conditions. Once a congested road is predicted, we adopt a proactive vehicle re-routing algorithm for assigning alternative routes to cars before they enter the congested road. At the same time, the traffic light control agents use an online strategy for assigning long time duration of green traffic lights to the roads with a large amount of pheromone. Experimental results confirm its superiority in alleviating traffic congestion.", "In the context of electronic commerce, when modeling the trustworthiness of selling agent relies (in part) on propagating ratings provided by buying agents that have personal experience with the seller, the problem of unfair ratings arises. Extreme diversity of open and dynamic electronic marketplaces causes difficulties in handling unfair ratings in trust management systems. To ease this problem, we propose a novel trust-based incentive mechanism for eliciting fair ratings of sellers from buyers. In our mechanism, buyers model other buyers, using an approach that combines both private and public reputation values. In addition, however, sellers model the reputation of buyers. Reputable buyers provide fair ratings of sellers, and are likely considered trustworthy by many other buyers. In marketplaces operating with our mechanism, sellers will offer more attractive products to satisfy reputable buyers, in order to\u00a0\u2026", "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based recommender systems have recently come into the limelight due to their ability to optimize long-term user engagement. A significant challenge in DRL-based recommender systems is the large action space required to represent a variety of items. The large action space weakens the sampling efficiency and thereby, affects the recommendation accuracy. In this article, we propose a DRL-based method called deep hierarchical category-based recommender system (DHCRS) to handle the large action space problem. In DHCRS, categories of items are used to reconstruct the original flat action space into a two-level category-item hierarchy. DHCRS uses two deep    -networks (DQNs): 1) a high-level DQN for selecting a category and 2) a low-level DQN to choose an item in this category for the recommendation. Hence, the action space of each DQN is significantly reduced\u00a0\u2026", "Feature hierarchy (FH) has proven to be effective to improve recommendation accuracy. Prior work mainly focuses on the influence of vertically affiliated features (ie child-parent) on user-item interactions. The relationships of horizontally organized features (ie siblings and cousins) in the hierarchy, however, has only been little investigated. We show in real-world datasets that feature relationships in horizontal dimension can help explain and further model user-item interactions. To fully exploit FH, we propose a unified recommendation framework that seamlessly incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions for effective recommendation. Our model further considers two types of semantically rich feature relationships in horizontal dimension, ie complementary and alternative relationships. Extensive validation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach against the state of the art. An additional benefit of our model is to provide better interpretations of the generated recommendations.", "Traffic congestion has always been an impending challenge for drivers as well as traffic authorities. It causes frustrations to millions of passengers. The estimated financial cost is $2,200 billion per year in developed countries worldwide. In this paper, we propose an intelligent routing algorithm to minimize the traffic jam occurrence through directing the paths of multiple vehicles cooperatively. According to Kerner's breakdown minimization principle, we can claim that the traffic network optimum has been achieved if the probability for spontaneous traffic jam occurrence over the entire road network during a given observation time period is minimized. The proposed multivehicle routing approach is fully scalable and distributed, which essentially makes it directly applicable to real traffic networks such as that in Singapore. Through numerical studies, the proposed algorithm is much faster in terms of convergence speed\u00a0\u2026", "We rethink the link prediction problem in signed social networks by also considering\" no-relation\" as a future status of a node pair, rather than simply distinguishing positive and negative links proposed in the literature. To understand the underlying mechanism of link formation in signed networks, we propose a feature framework on the basis of a thorough exploration of potential features for the newly identified problem. Grounded on the framework, we also design a trinary classification model, and experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.", "A core challenge of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) is to attain evenly distributed Pareto optimal solutions along the Pareto front. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetric Pareto-adaptive (apa) scheme for the identification of well distributed Pareto optimal solutions based on the geometrical characteristics of the Pareto front. The apa scheme applies to problem with symmetric and asymmetric Pareto fronts. Evaluation on multiobjective problems with Pareto fronts of different forms confirms that apa improves both convergence and diversity of the classical decomposition-based (MOEA/D) and Pareto dominance-based MOEAs (pa\u03b5-MyDE).", "The unfair rating problem exists when a buying agent models the trustworthiness of selling agents by also relying on ratings of the sellers from other buyers. Different probabilistic approaches have been proposed to cope with this issue. In this paper, we first summarize these approaches and provide a detailed categorization of them. This includes our own \"personalized\" approach for addressing this problem. Based on the implication of such analysis, we then focus on experimental comparison of our approach with two key models in a framework that simulates a dynamic electronic marketplace environment. We specifically examine different scenarios, including ones where the majority of buyers are dishonest, buyers lack personal experience with sellers, sellers may vary their behavior, and buyers may provide a large number of ratings.

Most existing works focus on undirected graphs which overlooks the rich information carried by the edge directions. Recently, the problem of community search over directed graphs (or CSD problem) has been studied [Fang et al., 2019b]; it finds a connected subgraph containing q, where the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex within the subgraph are at least k and l, respectively. However, existing solutions are inefficient, especially on large graphs. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel index called D-Forest, which allows a CSD query to be completed within the optimal time cost. We further propose efficient index construction methods. Extensive experiments on six real large graphs show that our index-based query algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions.", "The large volume of data available in location-based social networks (LBSNs) enables Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation services. On another hand, the heterogeneous information (e.g., user check-in records, geographical features of POIs, social network and user reviews) imposes great challenges on effective POI recommendation. In this paper, we focus on leveraging such rich information in an integrated manner to improve POI recommendation performance. We exploit not only the geographical and social information, but also aspects extracted from user reviews to better model users' preferences. More specifically, to fully utilize various types of information, we construct a novel heterogeneous graph, Aspect-aware Geo-Social influence Graph (AGSG), by fusing various relations among the three types of nodes, i.e., users, POIs and aspects.

To handle the hardness of bidder valuation, we introduce the capacity query which uses different item capacity profiles to efficiently elicit valuation information from bidders.

Specifically, we employ an adapted association rule technique to reveal implicit item relationships in terms of item-to-item and group-to-item associations, which are then used to regularize the generation of low-rank user- and item-feature matrices. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach against other counterparts.", "Considering opinions of other users (called advisors) has become increasingly important for each user in open and dynamic online environments. However, users might be subjectively different or strategically dishonest. Previous approaches on this problem generally suffer from the issue of limited (especially shared) historic experience when tracking each individual advisor\u2019s behavior. In this paper, instead, we model each advisor as part of groups by proposing a two-layered clustering approach. Specifically, in the first layer, the agent of each user clusters her advisors into different subjectivity groups and dishonest types, with respect to their rating behavior. In the second layer, each advisor is assigned to groups with respective membership degrees. Finally, each agent adopts an alignment approach to help its user align advisors\u2019 ratings to the ones of her own. Experimental results on both simulations and real data verify that our approach can better help users utilize ratings provided by advisors in opinion evaluation and recommender systems.", "In game theoretical analysis of incentive mechanisms, all players are assumed to be rational. Since it is likely that mechanism participants in the real world may not be fully rational, such mechanisms may not work as effectively as in the idealized settings for which they were designed. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the robustness of incentive mechanisms against various types of agents with bounded rational behaviors. Such evaluations would provide us with the information needed to choose mechanisms with desired properties in real environments. In this article, we first propose a general robustness measure, inspired by research in evolutionary game theory, as the maximal percentage of invaders taking non-equilibrium strategies such that the agents sustain the desired equilibrium strategy.

However, it is more useful to present ratings of product features (such as price, battery, screen, and lens of digital cameras) to help customers make effective purchase decisions. Unfortunately, only a very few web sites have collected feature ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accurately estimate feature ratings of products. This approach selects user reviews that extensively discuss specific features of the products (called specialized reviews), using information distance of reviews on the features. Experiments on both annotated and real data show that overall ratings of the specialized reviews can be used to represent their feature ratings. The average of these overall ratings can be used by recommender systems to provide feature-specific\u00a0\u2026", "We propose a method to determine the credibility of messages that are posted in participatory media (such as blogs), of use in recommender systems designed to provide users with messages that are considered to be the most credible to them.

We use this insight to improve recommendation algorithms for messages created in participatory media environments.

Their performance varies highly depending on environments where they are applied. However, it is challenging to choose suitable models for environments where ground truth about seller trustworthiness is unknown (called unknown environments). We propose a novel framework to choose suitable trust models for unknown environments, based on the intuition that if a model performs well in one environment, it will do so in another similar environment. Specifically, for an unknown environment, we identify a similar simulated environment (with known ground truth) where the trust model performing the best will be chosen as the suitable solution. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of our framework in choosing suitable trust models for different environments.", "We propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn large neighborhood search (LNS) policy for integer programming (IP). The RL policy is trained as the destroy operator to select a subset of variables at each step, which is reoptimized by an IP solver as the repair operator. However, the combinatorial number of variable subsets prevents direct application of typical RL algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we represent all subsets by factorizing them into binary decisions on each variable. We then design a neural network to learn policies for each variable in parallel, trained by a customized actor-critic algorithm. We evaluate the proposed method on four representative IP problems. Results show that it can find better solutions than SCIP in much less time, and significantly outperform other LNS baselines with the same runtime. Moreover, these advantages notably persist when the policies generalize to larger problems. Further experiments with Gurobi also reveal that our method can outperform this state-of-the-art commercial solver within the same time limit.", "Existing network embedding algorithms based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) improve the robustness of node embeddings by selecting high-quality negative samples with the generator to play against the discriminator. Since most of the negative samples can be easily discriminated from positive samples in graphs, their poor competitiveness weakens the function of the generator. Inspired by the sales skills in the market, in this article, we present tripartite adversarial training for network embeddings (TriATNE), a novel adversarial learning framework for learning stable and robust node embeddings. TriATNE consists of three players: 1) producer; 2) seller; and 3) customer. The producer strives to learn the representation of each sample (node pair), making it easy for the customer to differentiate between the positive and the negative, while the seller tries to confuse the customer by selecting realistic\u00a0\u2026", "Posted-price mechanisms are widely-adopted to decide the price of tasks in popular microtask crowdsourcing. In this paper, we propose a novel postedprice mechanism which not only outperforms existing mechanisms on performance but also avoids their need of a finite price range. The advantages are achieved by converting the pricing problem into a multi-armed bandit problem and designing an optimal algorithm to exploit the unique features of microtask crowdsourcing. We theoretically show the optimality of our algorithm and prove that the performance upper bound can be achieved without the need of a prior price range. We also conduct extensive experiments using real price data to verify the advantages and practicability of our mechanism.", "Crowdsourcing is a rapidly growing technology to harness human intelligence to solve problems that are not suitable for automation. It is especially suitable for consensus tasks which collect opinions from human workers to gain insight into real-world phenomena. In these tasks, motivating workers to provide their truthful opinions is a challenging problem. Most existing incentive mechanisms proposed to address this problem assume that workers share a common prior. However, this assumption is not always valid in practice, resulting in that the existing approaches may discourage workers to provide their truthful opinions. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism -- iMET -- to elicit truthful opinions for crowdsourced multiple-choice consensus tasks. By incorporating the concepts of worker credibility and similarity, iMET rewards workers for providing truthful opinions without assuming a common prior\u00a0\u2026", "Truthful bidding is a desirable property for continuous double auctions (CDAs). Many incentive mechanisms have been proposed to elicit truthful bids. However, existing truthful CDA mechanisms often overlook the possibility that sellers may choose not to deliver the auctioned items to buyers as promised. In this situation, buyers may become unwilling to bid their true valuations in the future to compensate for their risks of being cheated, thereby rendering CDAs ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation-aware CDA (named RCDA) mechanism to consider the honesty of auction participants. It dynamically adjusts bids and asks according to the reputation of participants to reflect the risks involved in the transactions. Theoretical analysis proves that RCDA is effective in eliciting truthful bids from buyers and sellers in the presence of possible dishonest behavior from both buyers and sellers.", "It is indispensable for users to evaluate the trustworthiness of other users (referred to as advisors), to cope with possible misleading opinions provided by them. Advisors\u2019 misleading opinions may be induced by their dishonesty, subjectivity difference with users, or both. Existing approaches do not well distinguish the two different causes. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic graphical trust model to separately consider these two factors, involving three types of latent variables: benevolence, integrity and competence of advisors, trust propensity of users, and subjectivity difference between users and advisors. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our method advances state-of-the-art approaches to a large extent.", "PGP Web of Trust where users can sign digital signatures on public key certificates of other users has been successfully applied in securing emails and files transmitted over the Internet. However, its rigorous restrictions on utilizable trust relationships and acceptable signatures limit its performance. In this paper, we first make some modification and extension to PGP Web of Trust by relaxing those constraints. In addition, we propose a novel method to further expand trusted neighborhood of users by merging the signatures of the trusted neighbors and finding the similar users based on the merged signature set. Confirmed by the experiments carried out in different simulated real-life scenarios, our method applied to both the modified and extended PGP methods can improve their performance. With the expansion of trusted neighborhood, the performance of the original PGP Web of Trust is also improved considerably.", "In this paper, we propose a trust opinion aggregation scheme in vehicular ad-hoc networks, to support trust models used to evaluate the quality of information shared among peers in the environment. Our scheme extends an existing identity-based aggregate signature algorithm to correctly combine signatures for multiple messages into one aggregate signature and eliminate signature redundancy. As a result, our proposed scheme is secure and archives both space efficiency and time efficiency, as confirmed by our comparative analysis.", "It is difficult for online users to keep track of their social friendships and friends' social activities scattered across different social networking sites. We propose a user-centric approach for integrating social data from different social networking sites and allowing users to create personalized social and semantic contexts for their social data. Users can blend and group friends on different social networking sites. They can also rate friends and their activities as favourite, neutral or disliked. Our approach then provides personalized recommendations of friends' activities that may be interesting to each user. A prototype of a dashboard application called SocConnect (Social Connect) is also implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, along with evaluation on real users that confirms the appropriateness and effectiveness of our approach.", "In this paper, we focus on the challenge that users face in processing messages on the web posted in participatory media settings, such as blogs. It is desirable to recommend to users a restricted set of messages that may be most valuable to them. Credibility of a message is an important criteria to judge its value. In our approach, theories developed in sociology, political science and information science are used to design a model for evaluating the credibility of messages that is user-specific and that is sensitive to the social network in which the user resides. To recommend new messages to users, we employ Bayesian learning, built on past user behaviour, integrating new concepts of context and completeness of messages inspired from the strength of weak ties hypothesis, from social network theory. We are able to demonstrate that our method is effective in providing the most credible messages to users\u00a0\u2026", "In virtual communities (e.g., forums, blogs), modeling the trust of community members is an effective way to help members make decisions about whose information is more valuable. Towards this goal, we first formulate hypotheses on how various interaction attributes influence trust in virtual communities, and validate these hypotheses through experiments on real data. The influential attributes are then used to develop a trust ranking-based recommendation model called TruRank for recommending the most trustworthy community members. Contrary to traditional recommender systems that rely heavily on subjective manual feedback, our model is built on the foundation of carefully verified objective interaction attributes in virtual communities.", "Users of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) like Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, or Twitter, are often overwhelmed by the huge amount of social data (friends\u2019 updates and other activities). We propose using machine learning techniques to learn preferences of users and generate personalized recommendations. We apply four different machine learning techniques on previously rated activities and friends to generate personalized recommendations for activities that may be interesting to each user. We also use different non-textual and textual features to represent activities. The evaluation results show that good performance can be achieved when both non-textual and textual features are used, thus helping users deal with cognitive overload.", "Recommender Systems (RSs) in real-world applications often deal with billions of user interactions daily. To capture the most recent trends effectively, it is common to update the model incrementally using only the newly arrived data. However, this may impede the model\u2019s ability to retain long-term information due to the potential overfitting and forgetting issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adaptive Sequential Model Generation (ASMG) framework, which generates a better serving model from a sequence of historical models via a meta generator. For the design of the meta generator, we propose to employ Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to leverage its ability to capture the long-term dependencies. We further introduce some novel strategies to apply together with the GRU meta generator, which not only improve its computational efficiency but also enable more accurate sequential modeling.

There exists a formal model that measures the maximum impact of independent attackers [Wang et al., 2015] \u2014 based on information theory. We improve on these results in multiple ways: (1) we alter the methodology to be able to reason about colluding attackers as well, and (2) we extend the method to be able to measure the strength of any attacks (rather than just the strongest attack). Using (1), we identify the strongest collusion attacks, helping construct robust trust system. Using (2), we identify the strength of (classes of) attacks that we found in the literature. Based on this, we help to overcome a shortcoming of current research into collusion-resistance \u2014 specific (types of) attacks are used in simulations, disallowing direct comparisons between analyses of systems.", "In this paper, we propose a biclustering-based approach to identify dishonest advisors (who provide misleading opinions about sellers), while evaluating seller trustworthiness on multiple criteria. It considers correlation between advisors' ratings to various criteria and trust transitivity to accurately filter the dishonest advisors. Evaluation results demonstrate the robustness of our approach against various types of unfair rating attacks.", "In competitive electronic marketplaces where some selling agents may be dishonest and quality products offered by good sellers are limited, selecting the most profitable sellers as transaction partners is challenging, especially when buying agents lack personal experience with sellers. Reputation systems help buyers to select sellers by aggregating seller information reported by other buyers (called advisers). However, in such competitive marketplaces, buyers may also be concerned about the possibility of losing business opportunities with good sellers if they report truthful seller information. In this paper, we propose a trust-oriented mechanism built on a game theoretic basis for buyers to: (1) determine an optimal seller reporting strategy, by modeling the trustworthiness (competency and willingness) of advisers in reporting seller information; (2) discover sellers who maximize their profit by modeling the\u00a0\u2026", "Belief fusion consists of taking into account multiple sources of belief about a domain of interest. This paper describes cumulative and averaging multi-source belief fusion in the formalism of subjective logic, which represent generalisations of binary-source belief fusion operators previously described. The advantage of this approach is that we can model and analyse belief fusion situations involving an arbitrary number of sources.", "In e-commerce systems, user preference can be inferred from multivariate implicit feedback (i.e., actions). However, most methods merely focus on homogeneous implicit feedback (i.e., purchase). In this paper, we adopt another two typical actions, i.e., view and like, as auxiliaries to enhance purchase recommendation, whereby a trinity Bayesian personalized ranking (TBPR) method is proposed. Specifically, we introduce trinity preference to investigate the difference of users' preference among three types of items: 1) items with purchase action; 2) items with only auxiliary actions; 3) items without any action. Empirical study on the real-world dataset demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "This paper studies how machine learning techniques can facilitate the detection of accounting fraud in publicly traded US firms. Existing studies often mimic human experts and employ the financial or nonfinancial ratios as the features for their systems. We depart from these studies by adopting raw accounting variables, which are directly available from a firm\u2019s financial statement and thereby can be easily applied to new firms at low cost. Further, we collected the most complete fraud dataset of US publicly traded firms and labeled the fraud and non-fraud firm-years. One key issue of the dataset is that the data is extremely imbalanced, in which the fraud firm-years are often less than one percent. Without re-sampling the data, we further propose to tackle the imbalance issue by adopting the techniques of imbalanced learning. In particular, we employ the linear and nonlinear Biased Penalty Support Vector Machine and the Ensemble Methods, both of which have been proved to successfully handle the imbalance issue in the machine learning literatures. We finally evaluate our approach by conducting extensive empirical studies. Empirical results show that the proposed schema can achieve much better performance, in terms of balanced accuracy, than the state of the art. Besides the performance, our approaches can also compute very fast, which further supports their practical deployment.", "Trust systems assist in dealing with users who may betray one another. Cunning users (attackers) may attempt to hide the fact that they betray others, deceiving the system. Trust systems that are difficult to deceive are considered more robust. To formally reason about robustness, we formally model the abilities of an attacker. We prove that the attacker model is maximal, i.e. 1) the attacker can perform any feasible attack and 2) if a single attacker cannot perform an attack, then a group of attackers cannot perform that attack. Therefore, we can formulate robustness analogous to security.", "A qualitative way is desirable for web service selection according to agents' preferences on non-functional Quality of Service (QoS) attributes of services. However, it is challenging when the decision has to be made for multiple agents with preferences on attributes that may be incomplete. In this paper, we first use a qualitative graphical representation tool called CP-nets to describe preference relations in a relatively compact, intuitive and structured manner. We then propose algorithms based on this representation to select web services for multiple agents despite the presence of incompleteness in their preference orderings. Our experimental results indicate that this method can always obtain some optimal outcomes which closely satisfy all agents.", "In real-world project scheduling applications, activity durations are often uncertain. Proactive scheduling can effectively cope with the duration uncertainties, by generating robust baseline solutions according to a priori stochastic knowledge. However, most of the existing proactive approaches assume that the duration uncertainty of an activity is not related to its scheduled start time, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we relax this assumption by allowing the duration uncertainty to be time-dependent, which is caused by the uncertainty of whether the activity can be executed on each time slot. We propose a stochastic optimization model to find an optimal Partial-order Schedule (POS) that minimizes the expected makespan. This model can cover both the time-dependent uncertainty studied in this paper and the traditional time-independent duration uncertainty. To circumvent the underlying complexity in evaluating a given solution, we approximate the stochastic optimization model based on Sample Average Approximation (SAA). Finally, we design two efficient branch-and-bound algorithms to solve the NP-hard SAA problem. Empirical evaluation confirms that our approach can generate high-quality proactive solutions for a variety of uncertainty distributions.", "In industry, many problems are considered as the Decentralized Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (DRCMPSP). Existing approaches encounter difficulties in dealing with large problems while preserving information privacy of project agents. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve DRCMPSP based on the multi-unit combinatorial auction, which can efficiently solve the problem without violating information privacy. It adopts a greedy resource allocation strategy with fixed resource cost to simplify computation required for project (bidder) and auctioneer agents. In addition, a bid modification step is incorporated to allow project agents to better utilize resources. Analysis and empirical results indicate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized approaches in minimizing average project delay, and scales well to large problems with thousands of activities from tens of projects.", "A framework has been developed as a basis for design and implementation of adaptive Web systems. This framework and the respective architecture support the idea of high-level synthesis and facilitate different types of adaptation.

PENS is implemented as the proof of concept and to demonstrate how Web pages are synthesized with different attributes from the same description, and to show adaptation based on users' behavior and client-side characteristics.", "Recent deep models for solving routing problems always assume a single distribution of nodes for training, which severely impairs their cross-distribution generalization ability. In this paper, we exploit group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) to tackle this issue, where we jointly optimize the weights for different groups of distributions and the parameters for the deep model in an interleaved manner during training. We also design a module based on convolutional neural network, which allows the deep model to learn more informative latent pattern among the nodes. We evaluate the proposed approach on two types of well-known deep models including GCN and POMO. The experimental results on the randomly synthesized instances and the ones from two benchmark dataset (ie, TSPLib and CVRPLib) demonstrate that our approach could significantly improve the cross-distribution generalization performance over the original models.", "Recently, there is a growing attention on applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the 3-D bin packing problem (3-D BPP). However, due to the relatively less informative yet computationally heavy encoder, and considerably large action space inherent to the 3-D BPP, existing DRL methods are only able to handle up to 50 boxes. In this article, we propose to alleviate this issue via a DRL agent, which sequentially addresses three subtasks of sequence, orientation, and position, respectively. Specifically, we exploit a multimodal encoder, where a sparse attention subencoder embeds the box state to mitigate the computation while learning the packing policy, and a convolutional neural network subencoder embeds the view state to produce auxiliary spatial representation. We also leverage an action representation learning in the decoder to cope with the large action space of the position subtask.

However, in real-world life, people always have different trust relationships with others (e.g., best friend, acquaintance, frenemy). For various applications such as social recommendation and semantic web, it is more worthwhile to know the trust strength between users. In this work, via a unique dataset obtained from a Facebook app and a carefully designed user study, we map trust values with users' online interactions, and thus build personalized trust models. For each individual, we learn her trust model via optimization on a ranking-oriented loss function. Experimental results demonstrate the superior of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art method and the good generalization ability of the approach.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in Singapore is focused on accelerating the country\u2019s development into a Smart Nation.

Towards this goal, we propose a distributed Host-based IDS (HIDS) collaboration system, particularly focusing on acquaintance management where each HIDS selects and maintains a list of collaborators from which they can consult about intrusions. More specifically, each HIDS evaluates both the false positive (FP) rate and false negative (FN) rate of its neighboring HIDSes' opinions about intrusions using Bayesian learning, and aggregates their opinions about intrusions using a Bayesian decision model.

However, the ratings in SIoV expose user privacy, including behavior, location, etc., which are required to be protected properly. Meanwhile, the blockchain technology with its distributed paradigm is potentially employed to protect information privacy. In this study, we propose the design of a blockchain-enabled reputation system named \u201cVRepChain\u201d for SIoV by especially considering the rating privacy issue. In our design, the ratings' privacy is strongly preserved in the processes of transmission and storage.

Existing approaches are mainly extended from heuristics of the traditional models in unsigned networks. They suffer from two limitations:(1) mainly focus on global rankings thus cannot provide effective personalized ranking results, and (2) have a relatively unrealistic assumption that each user treats her neighbors\u2019 social strengths indifferently. To address these two issues, we propose a supervised method based on random walk to learn social strengths between each user and her neighbors, in which the random walk more likely visits \u201cpotential friends\u201d and less likely visits \u201cpotential enemies\u201d. We learn the personalized social strengths by optimizing on a particularly designed loss function oriented on ranking. We further present a fast ranking method based on the local structure among each seed node and a certain set of candidates. It much simplifies the proposed ranking model meanwhile maintains the performance.

The task of routing in these resource-constraint networks is particularly challenging as they operate over prolonged deployment periods, necessitating optimal use of their resources. Moreover, due to the deployment in unattended environments, they become an easy target for attackers. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical POMDP based approach to make routing decisions with partial/limited information about the sensor nodes, in a secure and energy-efficient manner. We demonstrate in a large-scale simulation that the approach provides a better energy/packet delivery tradeoff than competing methods, and also validate these conclusions in a real-world testbed.", "This paper aims at solving a stochastic shortest path problem. The objective is to determine an optimal path which maximizes the probability of arriving on time given a time constraint (i.e., a deadline). To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven approach. We first reformulate the original finding optimal path problem as a cardinality minimization problem. Then, we apply an L 1  norm minimization technique to solve the cardinality problem. The problem is transformed into a mix integer linear programming problem, which can be solved using standard solvers. This proposed approach has three advantages over the traditional methods: (1) the proposed approach can handle various or even unknown travel time distributions, while traditional stochastic routing algorithms can only work on specified distributions; (2) the proposed approach does not rely on the assumption that the travel time on different road segments\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we examine a challenge that arises in the application of peer-based tutoring: coping with inappropriate advice from peers.

To avoid presenting annotations that would detract from student learning (e.g. those found confusing by other students) we integrate trust modeling, to detect over time the reputation of the annotation (as voted by previous students) and the reputability of the annotator. We empirically demonstrate, through simulation, that even when the environment is populated with a large number of poor annotations, our algorithm for directing the learning of the students is effective, confirming the value of our proposed approach for student modeling.

In this paper, we propose a novel Framework of Integrating both Latent and Explicit features (FILE), to better deal with the no-relation status and improve the overall link prediction performance in signed networks.

To address these issues, we propose an incentive mechanism to promote buyer and seller honesty for this type of e-marketplaces.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Adversarial Two-tower Neural Network (ATNN) model for new arrivals CTR predictions by introducing an adversarial network to a two-tower network. We design a generator and a discriminator to better learn an item vector based on item profiles without item statistics.

However, in a practical scenario, it is quite natural that the data labels are available only after some temporal lag. This paper explores how a stream classifier model can be made adaptive to such label latency scenario. We propose SkipE-RNN, a self-evolutionary recurrent neural network with dynamically evolving skipped-recurrent-connection for the best utilization of previously observed label information while classifying the current data. When the data label is unavailable, SkipE-RNN uses an auto-learned mapping function to find the best match from the already known data labels and updates the network parameter accordingly. Later, upon availability of true data label, if the previously mapped label is found to be incorrect, SkipE-RNN employs a regularization technique along with the parameter updating process, so as to penalize the model. In addition, SkipE-RNN has inborn power of self-adjusting the network capacity by growing/pruning hidden nodes to cope with the evolving nature of data stream. Rigorous empirical evaluations using synthetic as well as real-world datasets reveal effectiveness of SkipE-RNN in both finitely delayed and infinitely delayed data label scenarios.", "Owing to the lack of historical data regarding an entity in online communities, a user may rely on stereotyping to estimate its behavior based on historical data about others. However, these stereotypes cannot accurately reflect the user\u2019s evaluation if they are based on limited historical data about other entities. In view of this issue, we propose a novel generalized stereotype learning approach: the fuzzy semantic framework. Specifically, we propose a fuzzy semantic process, incorporated with traditional machine-learning techniques to construct stereotypes. It consists of two sub-processes: a fuzzy process that generalizes over non-nominal attributes (e.g., price) by splitting their values in a fuzzy manner, and a semantic process that generalizes over nominal attributes (e.g., location) by replacing their specific values with more general terms according to a predefined ontology.

To alleviate this problem, countermeasures have been proposed that leverage the collective behaviors of colluders. The motivation stems from the observation that colluders typically act in a very synchronized way, as they are instructed by the same campaigns with common items to target and schedules to follow. However, the collective behaviors examined in existing solutions focus mostly on the external appearance of fraud campaigns, such as the campaign size and the size of the targeted item set.

To address these issues, we combine both qualitative and quantitative preferences as well as service trust together in the process of service composition.

We compare the results of applying five different machine learning techniques on previously rated activities and friends to generate personalized recommendations for activities that may be interesting to each user. The results show that machine learning can be usefully applied in predicting the interest level of users in their social network activities, thus helping them deal with cognitive overload. A visualization technique that has been shown to work well in previous work is applied to display personalized recommendations.", "This paper investigates the reliable shortest path (RSP) problem in Gaussian process (GP) regulated transportation networks. Specifically, the RSP problem that we are targeting at is to minimize the (weighted) linear combination of mean and standard deviation of the path\u2019s travel time. With the reasonable assumption that the travel times of the underlying transportation network follow a multi-variate Gaussian distribution, we propose a Gaussian process path planning (GP3) algorithm to calculate the a priori optimal path as the RSP solution. With a series of equivalent RSP problem transformations, we are able to reach a polynomial time complexity algorithm with guaranteed solution accuracy. Extensive experimental results over various sizes of realistic transportation networks demonstrate the superior performance of GP3 over the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "Reputation fraud campaigns (RFCs) distort the reputations of rated items, by generating fake ratings through multiple spammers. One effective way of detecting RFCs is to characterize their collective behaviors based on rating histories. However, these campaigns are constantly evolving and changing tactics to evade detection. For example, they can launch early attacks on the items to quickly dominate the reputations. They can also whitewash themselves through creating new accounts for subsequent attacks. It is thus challenging for existing approaches working on historical data to promptly react to such emerging fraud activities. In this paper, we conduct RFC detection in online fashion, so as to spot campaign activities as early as possible. This leads to a unified and scalable optimization framework, FRAUDSCAN, that can adapt to emerging fraud patterns over time. Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.", "Social commitment protocols regulate interactions of agents in multiagent systems. Several methods have been developed to analyze properties of commitment protocols. However, analysis of an agent's behavior in a commitment protocol, which should take into account the agent's goals and beliefs, has received less attention. In this paper we present ProMoca framework to address this issue. Firstly, we develop an expressive formal language to model agents with respect to their commitments. Our language provides dedicated elements to define commitment protocols, and model agents in terms of their goals, behaviors, and beliefs. Furthermore, our language provides probabilistic and non-deterministic elements to model uncertainty in agents' beliefs. Secondly, we identify two essential properties of an agent with respect to a commitment protocol, namely compliance and goal satisfaction. We formalize these properties using a probabilistic variant of linear temporal logic. Thirdly, we adapt a probabilistic model checking algorithm to automatically analyze compliance and goal satisfaction properties. Finally, we present empirical results about efficiency and scalability of ProMoca.", "This work proposes an agent-based simulation system to address challenges in resource constrained multi project scheduling for a technology intensive industrial product development programme. The system aims at helping users develop robust programme schedules by taking care of intra-and inter-dependencies between projects, potential knock-on effect of unpredictable events, and resource constraints. With the interactive graphic user interface embedded in the system, users are enabled to investigate project process, evaluate modified programme schedule and conduct various whatif analysis.", "Reputation systems deployed in popular online auction sites simply aggregate feedback about a seller's past transactions. By studying a real auction site dataset, we infer that a non-negligible fraction of unsatisfactory transactions involve sellers with high reputation. Such a phenomenon can be interpreted by motivation theory from behaviorial science: A seller with high reputation has more business opportunities. Bad feedback for latest transactions do not immediately affect his reputation adequately to hurt business, hence he may not be as prudent as before. In this work, we propose the concept of imprudence to study and detect the inappropriate behavior of a 'reliable' seller (i.e., the one with high reputation computed using conventional approaches). Specifically, we first identify and verify the features that influence a seller's imprudence behavior. We then design a novel intelligent buying agent to combine these\u00a0\u2026", "Online reviews, as one kind of new marketing methods, are becoming increasingly important in influencing preferences and decision-making of consumers. In view of this, this paper conducts an empirical study on Dangdang Books, constructs a research framework on correlation between product sales and aspects of online reviews, and explores the correction through the panel data econometric model. Compared to former research, our work analyzes real data on product sales instead of the rank of sales. Based on our study results and comparison with others' research results on Amazon (amazon.com), we provide several guiding suggestions for online review systems in the Chinese context. These systems should pay attention to emotional tendency of reviews, reviewer ranking mechanisms, spotlight reviews, review format and review voting mechanisms.", "Reputation systems bear some challenging problems where buyers have different subjectivity in evaluating their experience with sellers and they may not have incentives to share their experience. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation system based on dynamic coalition formation where buyers with similar subjectivity and rich experience will be awarded virtual credits for helping others find trustworthy sellers to successfully conduct business. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the coalitions formed in this way are stable.", "In academic research, recommender systems are often evaluated on benchmark datasets, without much consideration about the global timeline. Hence, we are unable to answer questions like: Do loyal users enjoy better recommendations than non-loyal users? Loyalty can be defined by the time period a user has been active in a recommender system, or by the number of historical interactions a user has. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis of recommendation results along global timeline. We conduct experiments with five widely used models, i.e., BPR, NeuMF, LightGCN, SASRec and TiSASRec, on four benchmark datasets, i.e., MovieLens-25M, Yelp, Amazon-music, and Amazon-electronic. Our experiment results give an answer \"No\" to the above question. Users with many historical interactions suffer from relatively poorer recommendations. Users who stay with the system for a shorter time period\u00a0\u2026", "Trust and distrust between online users play an important role in social network applications, especially in the security domain. For example, trust information can enhance social recommendation and distrust information can be used for fraud detection. However, trust prediction is challenging due to the existence and imbalance of the three kinds of social status in signed social networks (i.e., trust, distrust and no-relation). Furthermore, there are a variety types of no-relation status in reality, e.g., strangers and frenemies, which cannot be well distinguished from the other social status by existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel Framework of Integrating both Latent and Explicit features (FILE), to better deal with the no-relation status and hence improve the overall trust/distrust prediction performance. In particular, we design two latent features to model user's intrinsic personality. Meanwhile, we design\u00a0\u2026", "Social networks have proven to be effective for high-quality item recommendation. Most social recommenders, however, are insufficient to capture the user preferences over items, as they largely neglect the multi-facet social relations latent in the social network, such as classmates, colleagues, and families. We, therefore, propose a novel disentangled social recommendation (DSR) framework to exploit the multifacet social relations for enhanced item recommendation. Specifically, DSR explicitly disentangles the social relations into multiple facets, and encodes the social influence under each facet into disentangled user embeddings in the social network. The multiple user embeddings are then aggregated via a facet-level attention mechanism, which distinguishes the effective facets for better inferring user interests over items. Extensive experiments show the superiority of DSR against the state-of-the-art methods\u00a0\u2026", "E-learning systems are now considered a core IT support in most Institute of Higher Learning. Each student is assigned a set of courses based on their preferences for each semester. Learning materials are posted and evaluated through the system. Mining access and usage log data of the e-learning system can give insights such as on how these materials are accessed by students in their order of preferences on each of the courses. A study was carried out, and the results show that there is good correlation between students\u2019 performance and e-learning usage. In this paper, we describe our methodology on analyzing students\u2019 usage of e-learning systems for course management with the help of cloud computing services. We present a student performance predictive model built from the retrieved logs that is confirmed to achieve sufficiently good accuracy.", "Different trust models have been developed for dealing with possible dishonest behavior and attacks from malicious peer Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in a collaborative Intrusion Detection Network (IDN). For evaluating and comparing these models, this paper introduces a simulation framework that incorporates different components namely expertise model, deception model, attack model, and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework offers flexibility for users to adjust the simulation parameters according to their needs. We then compare three existing trust models in this domain to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework when used in analyzing their efficiency, robustness and scalability.", "In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism for eliciting fair ratings of selling agents from buying agents. In our mechanism, buyers model other buyers and select the most trustworthy ones as their neighbors from whom they can ask advice about sellers. In addition, however, sellers model the reputation of buyers. Reputable buyers always provide fair ratings of sellers, and are likely to be neighbors of many other buyers. In marketplaces operating with our mechanism, sellers will increase quality and decrease prices of products to satisfy reputable buyers. In consequence, our mechanism creates incentives for buyers to provide fair ratings of sellers.", "Recently, one critical issue looms large in the field of recommender systems \u2013 there are no effective benchmarks for rigorous evaluation \u2013 which consequently leads to unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. We, therefore, conduct studies from the perspectives of practical theory and experiments, aiming at benchmarking recommendation for rigorous evaluation. Regarding the theoretical study, a series of hyper-factors affecting recommendation performance throughout the whole evaluation chain are systematically summarized and analyzed via an exhaustive review on 141 papers published at eight top-tier conferences within 2017-2020. We then classify them into model-independent and model-dependent hyper-factors, and different modes of rigorous evaluation are defined and discussed in-depth accordingly. For the experimental study, we release DaisyRec 2.0 library by integrating these hyper\u00a0\u2026", "An incentive mechanism is designed to achieve desired outcomes as Nash equilibrium, by assuming agents to be fully rational. Nevertheless, practical agents may violate this assumption for various reasons, causing mechanisms to fail. Thus, before deploying a mechanism in practice, it is crucial to quantitatively evaluate to what extent the Nash equilibrium can resist different kinds of bounded rationality, termed robustness. In this paper, focusing on Nash equilibrium, we first propose a general robustness formulation as the upper bound of the stable region of equilibrium strategies by generalizing existing bounded rationality models. We also show that different existing robustness formulations of Nash equilibrium can be derived from this general formulation, which verifies the soundness of our formulation. Then, we develop a robustness evaluation framework specifically for incentive mechanisms, of which the key\u00a0\u2026", "In electronic commerce, buyers and sellers conduct transactions without physical interactions. In reputation systems, the trustworthiness of sellers is achieved by aggregating the ratings shared by other buyers with whom the sellers have ever conducted transactions. However, the ratings provided by buyers for evaluating the same seller could be diverse due to their different judgment criteria, which is referred as the subjectivity problem of reputation systems. It indicates that the ratings shared by some buyers may mislead other buyers with different personalities, making it challenging to aggregate the ratings properly in reputation systems. In this paper, in order to cope with the subjectivity problem, a hybrid architecture of reputation systems is proposed, which is based on coalition formation game theory. In the proposed module, buyers with the same subjectivity will automatically form a club, and share their ratings so\u00a0\u2026", "Existing testbeds to evaluate reputation systems are mainly simulation based and are not flexible to perform robustness evaluations against unfair rating attacks. In this paper, we present a novel comprehensive testbed, which can evaluate reputation systems using both simulations and real data. The testbed incorporates sophisticated deception models and unfair rating attack models, and introduces several performance metrics to fully test and compare the effectiveness and robustness of different reputation systems.", "In this paper, we propose a reputation mechanism for virtual marketplaces. The proposed approach is based on five-sense oriented feedback provision with the support of existing virtual reality technologies. We have conducted user studies to analyse users' attitude towards this new approach. These studies reveal that users prefer virtual marketplaces with our proposed reputation mechanism over that with traditional reputation mechanisms, and that our mechanism can effectively ensure user's trust in the virtual marketplaces and simultaneously promote user's trust in other users. Our approach is based on feedback from other users. Feedback from users could be very subjective and misleading for other users. Hence, we propose a novel mechanism to align subjective user feedback before reputation computations in virtual marketplaces. Results of our experiment demonstrate that with our feedback alignment\u00a0\u2026", "On participatory Websites, users provide opinions about products, with both overall ratings and textual reviews. In this paper, we propose an approach to accurately estimate feature ratings of the products. This approach selects user reviews that extensively discuss specific features of the products (called specialized reviews), using information distance of reviews on the features. Experiments on real data show that overall ratings of the specialized reviews can be used to represent their feature ratings. The average of these overall ratings can be used by recommender systems to provide feature specific recommendations that better help users make purchasing decisions.", "We propose a method to determine the credibility of messages that are posted in participatory media (such as blogs), of use in recommender systems designed to provide users with messages that are considered to be the most credible to them. Our approach draws from theories developed in sociology, political science, and information science\u2013this results in a method for evaluating the credibility of messages that is user-specific and sensitive to the social network in which the user resides. Our methodology rests on Bayesian learning, integrating new concepts of context and completeness of messages inspired by the strength of weak ties hypothesis from social network theory. We show that our credibility evaluation model can be used to significantly enhance the performance of collaborative filtering recommendation. Experimental validation is done using a dataset obtained from digg. com, a knowledge sharing website where users indicate their satisfaction with messages that are provided to them. Our results reinforce the value of using sociological insights in recommender system design.", "Familiarity between agents is often considered to be an important factor in determining the level of trust. In electronic marketplaces, trust is modeled, for instance, in order to allow buying agents to make effective selection of selling agents. In previous research, familiarity between two agents has been simply assumed to be the similarity between them, which is fixed for the two agents. We propose an improved familiarity measurement based on the exploration of factors that affect a human's feelings of familiarity and the mapping from those factors to the properties of agent societies. We examine the trust model in the context of a multiagent system within an e-commerce framework. We also carry out experiments to compare the stability of the system using the trust model with the improved familiarity measurement and that with the fixed familiarity values. Experimental results show that the stability of the system is\u00a0\u2026", "Many practical combinatorial optimization problems under uncertainty can be modeled as stochastic integer programs (SIPs), which are extremely challenging to solve due to the high complexity. To solve two-stage SIPs efficiently, we propose a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based method to learn scenario representation for a class of SIP instances. Specifically, we design a graph convolutional network based encoder to embed each scenario with the deterministic part of its instance (ie context) into a low-dimensional latent space, from which a decoder reconstructs the scenario from its latent representation conditioned on the context. Such a design effectively captures the dependencies of the scenarios on their corresponding instances. We apply the trained encoder to two tasks in typical SIP solving, ie scenario reduction and objective prediction. Experiments on two graph-based SIPs show that the learned representation significantly boosts the solving performance to attain high-quality solutions in short computational time, and generalizes fairly well to problems of larger sizes or with more scenarios.", "Customer services are critical to all companies, as they may directly connect to the brand reputation. Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method\u00a0\u2026", "Traffic congestion is a menace in the society with serious economic implications. Pressure based routing systems are known to be effective in wireless sensor networks, however rarely applied to transportation systems due to the nature of interactions between vehicles. This paper aims to alleviate the traffic congestion by adapting the node pressure concept into the traffic management system. In particular, we propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) with vehicle agents and infrastructure agents, which can collaborate to provide static and dynamic solutions for reducing the node pressure. Pertaining to the static solution, the infrastructure agents rely on a reinforcement learning method to calculate the optimal routes for vehicle agents. Pertaining to the dynamic solution, the infrastructure agents dynamically adjust and re-route vehicle agents based on a novel multi-unit combinatorial auctioning system proposed in this\u00a0\u2026", "With the rapid development of data sensing and collection technologies, we can easily obtain large volumes of data (big data). However, big data poses huge challenges to many popular machine learning techniques which take all the data at the same time for processing. To address the big data related challenges, we first partition the data along its feature space, and apply the parallel block coordinate descent algorithm for distributed computation; then, we continue to partition the data along the sample space, and propose a novel matrix decomposition and combination approach for distributed processing. The final results from all the entities are guaranteed to be the same as the centralized solution. Extensive experiments performed on Hadoop confirm that our proposed approach is superior in terms of both testing errors and convergence rate (computation time) over the canonical distributed machine learning techniques that deal with big data.", "Due to their open and anonymous nature, online social networks are particularly vulnerable to Sybil attacks. In recent years, there has been a rising interest in leveraging social network topological structures to combat Sybil attacks. Unfortunately, due to their strong dependency on unrealistic assumptions, existing graph-based Sybil defense mechanisms suffer from high false detection rates. In this paper, we focus on enhancing those mechanisms by considering additional graph structural information underlying social networks. Our solutions are based on our novel understanding and interpretation of Sybil detection as the problem of partially labeled classification. Specifically, we first propose an effective graph pruning technique to enhance the robustness of existing Sybil defense mechanisms against target attacks, by utilizing the local structural similarity between neighboring nodes in a social network. Second, we design a domain-specific graph regularization method to further improve the performance of those mechanisms by exploiting the relational property of the social network. Experimental results on four popular online social network datasets demonstrate that our proposed techniques can significantly improve the detection accuracy over the original Sybil defense mechanisms.", "Commitment protocols provide an effective formalism for the regulation of agent interaction. Although existing work mainly focus on the design-time development of static commitment protocols, recent studies propose methods to create them dynamically at run-time with respect to the goals of the agents. These methods require agents to verify new commitment protocols taking their goals, and beliefs about the other agents\u2019 behavior into account. Accordingly, in this paper, we first propose a probabilistic model to formally capture commitment protocols according to agents\u2019 beliefs. Secondly, we identify a set of important properties for the verification of a new commitment protocol from an agent\u2019s perspective and formalize these properties in our model. Thirdly, we develop probabilistic model checking algorithms with advanced reduction for efficient verification of these properties. Finally, we implement these algorithms as a tool and evaluate the proposed properties over different commitment protocols.", "The performance of trust models highly depend on the characteristics of the environments where they are applied. Thus, it becomes challenging to choose a suitable trust model for a given e-marketplace environment, especially when ground truth about the agent (buyer and seller) behavior is unknown (called unknown environment). We propose a case-based reasoning framework to choose suitable trust models for unknown environments, based on the intuition that if a trust model performs well in one environment, it will do so in another similar environment. Firstly, we build a case base with a number of simulated environments (with known ground truth) along with the trust models most suitable for each of them. Given an unknown environment, case-based retrieval algorithms retrieve the most similar case(s), and the trust model of the most similar case(s) is chosen as the most suitable model for the unknown environment. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of our framework in choosing suitable trust models for different e-marketplace environments.", "With the growth of social networks, recommender systems have taken advantage of the social network graph structures to provide better recommendation. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving trusted social feedback (TSF) system, in which users obtain feedback on questions or items from their friends. It is different from and independent of a typical recommender system because the responses from friends are not automated but tailored to specific questions. TSF can be used to complement the results from a recommender system. Our experimental prototype runs on the Google App Engine and utilises the Facebook social network graph. In our experimental evaluation, we have looked at users' perceptions of privacy and their trust in the prototype as well as the performances on the client side and the cloud side.", null, "A general assumption for incentive mechanisms is that all agents are rational and seek to maximize their utility. When some agents are irrational and launch various attacks, these mechanisms may fail to work. To address the issue of evaluating the robustness of incentive mechanisms, we propose a robustness metric in this paper. It is inspired by the studies of the evolutionary game theory and defined as the maximum percentage of irrational agents existing in the system while it is still better off for rational agents to perform desired strategies. Then a simulation framework is designed to measure the robustness of incentive mechanisms, and is verified to be able to produce the same results as those by theoretical analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our simulation framework in evaluating and comparing the robustness of two incentive mechanisms where irrational agents adopt different attacking strategics.", "In this paper, we focus on the problem of enabling vehicles in mobile vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to exchange information about traffic and road conditions in a way that makes it possible for each agent to assess the trustworthiness of the reports received. In particular, we develop a multi-faceted trust modeling framework that is designed specifically for VANET contexts, providing for trust modeling that includes reasoning about time and location and about agent roles, as part of the overall processing. We demonstrate the value of our trust modeling framework through simulated traffic environments, clarifying the importance of distinct elements of our multi-faceted model. In addition, we comment on the value of our chosen simulation environment towards future research to support more effective agent exchanges in VANETs.", "We propose a manager-worker framework (the implementation of our model is publically available at:  https://github.com/zcaicaros/manager-worker-mtsptwr ) based on deep reinforcement learning to tackle a hard yet nontrivial variant of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), i.e., multiple-vehicle TSP with time window and rejections (mTSPTWR), where customers who cannot be served before the deadline are subject to rejections. Particularly, in the proposed framework, a manager agent learns to divide mTSPTWR into sub-routing tasks by assigning customers to each vehicle via a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) based policy network. A worker agent learns to solve sub-routing tasks by minimizing the cost in terms of both tour length and rejection rate for each vehicle, the maximum of which is then fed back to the manager agent to learn better assignments.

MTL can improve learning efficiency and prediction accuracy by exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks. However, MTL is sensitive to relationships among tasks and may have performance degradation in real-world applications, because existing neural-based MTL models often share the same network structures and original input features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-task learning model based on Prototype Feature Extraction (PFE) to balance task-specific objectives and inter-task relationships. PFE is a novel component to disentangle features for multiple tasks. To better extract features from original inputs before gating networks, we introduce a new concept, namely prototype feature center, to disentangle features for multiple tasks.

The ad hoc agent cannot communicate with its teammates but it can observe their behaviour and plan accordingly. To do so, the existing approaches rely on the teammates\u2019 behaviour models. However, the models may not be accurate, which can compromise teamwork. For this reason, we present Ad Hoc Teamwork by Sub-task Inference and Selection (ATSIS) algorithm that uses a sub-task inference without relying on teammates\u2019 models. First, the ad hoc agent observes its teammates to infer which subtasks they are handling. Based on that, it selects its own sub-task using a partially observable Markov decision process that handles the uncertainty of the sub-task inference. Last, the ad hoc agent uses the Monte Carlo tree search to find the set of actions to perform the sub-task. Our experiments show the benefits of ATSIS for robust teamwork.", "Malicious vehicle agents broadcast fake information about traffic events and thereby undermine the benefits of vehicle-to-vehicle communication in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Trust management schemes addressing this issue do not focus on effective/fast decision making in reacting to traffic events. We propose a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based approach to balance the trade-off between information gathering and exploiting actions resulting in faster responses. Our model copes with malicious behavior by maintaining it as part of a small state space, thus is scalable for large VANETs. We also propose an algorithm to learn model parameters in a dynamic behavior setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively balance the decision quality and response time while still being robust to sophisticated malicious attacks.", "In trust systems, unfair rating attacks\u2014where advisors provide ratings dishonestly\u2014influence the accuracy of trust evaluation. A secure trust system should function properly under all possible unfair rating attacks; including dynamic attacks. In the literature, camouflage attacks are the most studied dynamic attacks. But an open question is whether more harmful dynamic attacks exist. We propose random processes to model and measure dynamic attacks. The harm of an attack is influenced by a user's ability to learn from the past. We consider three types of users: blind users, aware users, and general users. We found for all the three types, camouflage attacks are far from the most harmful. We identified the most harmful attacks, under which we found the ratings may still be useful to users.", "Automated negotiations play an important role in various domains modeled as multiagent systems, where agents represent human users and adopt different negotiation strategies. Generally, given a multiagent system, a negotiation strategy should be robust in the sense that most agents in the system have the incentive to choose it rather than other strategies. Empirical game-theoretic (EGT) analysis is a game-theoretic analysis approach to investigate the robustness of different strategies based on a set of empirical results. In this study, we propose that model-checking techniques can be adopted to improve EGT analysis for negotiation strategies. The dynamics of strategy profiles can be modeled as a labeled transition system using the counter abstraction technique. We define single-agent best deviation to represent the strategy deviations during negotiation, which focuses on each agent's best deviation benefit\u00a0\u2026", "Recommendations are widely used in recommender systems, reputation systems, and trust-based security systems. Some existing reputation systems and trust-based security systems use the flawed notion of endogenous discounting. Endogenous discounting is the idea that claims deviating from prior expectations should be ignored or discounted, which introduces confirmation bias. To show the fallacy of endogenous discounting, we construct a semantic meta-model that captures the key notions surrounding recommendations. We prove that any model covered by the meta-model can be formulated in a divide-and-conquer fashion. We show how divideand-conquer clashes with endogenous discounting. Lastly, we discuss the implications on existing work that applies endogenous discounting, and provide suggestions for future work.", "Traffic has become a universal metropolitan problem. This paper aims at easing the traffic jam situation through routing multiple cars cooperatively. We propose a novel distributed multi-vehicle routing algorithm with an objective of minimizing the road network breakdown probability. The algorithm is distributed, and hence highly scalable, making it applicable for large scale metropolitan road networks. Our algorithm always guarantees a much faster convergence rate than traditional distributed optimization techniques such as dual decomposition. Additionally, the algorithm always guarantees a feasible solution during the optimization process. This feature allows for real time decision making when applied to scenarios with time limits. We show the effectiveness of the algorithm by applying it to an arbitrarily large road network in simulation environment.", "In the absence of legal authorities and enforcement mechanisms in open e-marketplaces, it is extremely challenging for a user to validate the quality of opinions (i.e. Ratings and reviews) of products or services provided by other users (referred as advisers). Rationally, advisers tend to be reluctant to share their truthful experience with others. In this paper, we propose an adaptive incentive mechanism, where advisers are motivated to share their actual experiences with their trustworthy peers (friends/neighbors in the social network) in e-marketplaces (social commerce context), and malicious users will be eventually evacuated from the systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in promoting the honesty of users in sharing their past experiences.", "In an e-marketplace populated with a large number of sellers, some of which may be dishonest, the selection of good sellers to do business with is crucial but challenging especially when buyers do not have much experience with these sellers. In this paper we introduce the SALE POMDP, a framework for the seller selection problem that allows the decision maker to reason both about the quality of the sellers, as well as the trustworthiness of the advisors. In particular, the framework allows the agent to ask advisors about the trustworthiness of other advisors while still offering the benefit of optimally trading off information gathering and exploitation of knowledge as afforded by a POMDP based approach. Via this model, we present a preliminary investigation on the benefit of reasoning about trustworthiness of advisors. We also demonstrate how this enables incorporation of trust propagation as an integral part of the decision making process.", "Incomplete preferences of agents may render service selection ineffective. We address this problem by proposing a set of collaborative approaches to complementing agents' incomplete preferences in a qualitative way. For an agent, the approaches first find its similar agents, and then base the similar agents' qualitative preferences to complement this agent's missing preferences. We analyze and compare these approaches and provide experimental results to justify our arguments. We also compare our approach with the classic collaborative filtering and show the competitive advantages of our approach in service selection. Our work thus serves as an important step towards effective service selection.", "The unfair rating problem exists when a buying agent models the trustworthiness of selling agents by also relying on ratings of the sellers from other buyers in electronic marketplaces, that is in a reputation system. In this article, we first analyze the capabilities of existing approaches for coping with unfair ratings in different challenging scenarios, including ones where the majority of buyers are dishonest, buyers lack personal experience with sellers, sellers may vary their behavior, and buyers may provide a large number of ratings. We then present a personalized modeling approach (PMA) that has all these capabilities. Our approach allows a buyer to model both the private reputation and public reputation of other buyers to determine whether these buyers\u2019 ratings are fair. More importantly, in this work, we focus on experimental comparison of our approach with two key models in a simulated dynamic e-marketplace environment. We specifically examine the above mentioned scenarios to confirm our analysis and to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach. Our study thus provides the extensive experimental support for the personalized approach that can be effectively employed by reputation systems to cope with unfair ratings.", "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based recommender systems are suitable for user cold-start problems as they can capture user preferences progressively. However, most existing DRL-based recommender systems are suboptimal, since they use the same policy to suit the dynamics of different users. We reformulate recommendation as a multitask Markov Decision Process, where each task represents a set of similar users. Since similar users have closer dynamics, a task-specific policy is more effective than a single universal policy for all users. To make recommendations for cold-start users, we use a default policy to collect some initial interactions to identify the user task, after which a task-specific policy is employed. We use Q-learning to optimize our framework and consider the task uncertainty by the mutual information regarding tasks.

Fortunately, the conversation-based recommendation has been shown the merit of integrating immediate user preference for more accurate recommendations. We, therefore, propose a conversation-based adaptive relational translation (CART) approach for the next POI recommendation over uncertain check-ins. It is equipped with recommender and conversation modules to interactively acquire users' immediate preferences and make dynamic recommendations. Specifically, the recommender built upon the adaptive relational translation method performs location prediction via modeling both users' historical sequential behaviors and the immediate preference received from conversations; the conversation module aims to achieve successful recommendations in fewer conversation turns by learning a\u00a0\u2026", "The huge amount of heterogeneous information in location-based social networks (LBSNs) creates great challenges for POI recommendation.

Specifically, we first construct a novel knowledge graph (KG), named as Aspect-aware Geo-Social Influence Graph (AGS-IG), to unify multiple influential factors by integrating the heterogeneous information about users, POIs and aspects from reviews.

Subjectivity means that the information provided by each autonomous IoT device, represented by an agent, is likely to have been influenced by the device's individual preference, which can be misleading in trust evaluation. In this paper, we seek to align the potentially subjective information with the information seeker's own subjectivity so that the acquired second-hand information is more useful and personalized. Accordingly, we propose a multiagent subjectivity alignment (MASA) mechanism, which models the subjectivity using a regression technique and exchanges the models among agents as the input to an alignment process. This mechanism substantially counteracts biases incurred by\u00a0\u2026", "Active learning strategies are often used in crowd labeling to improve the task assignment. However, these strategies, which evaluates each possible assignment at first and then greedily selects the optimal one, may require prohibitive computation time but still cannot improve the assignment to the utmost. Thus, we develop a novel strategy by firstly deriving an efficient algorithm for assignment evaluation. Then, to overcome the uncertainty of labels, we modulate the scope of the greedy task assignment with the posterior uncertainty and keep the evaluation being optimistic. The experiments on four popular worker models and four MTurk datasets show that our strategy achieves the best performance and highest computation efficiency.", "In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of riskaware proactive scheduling with the objective of minimizing robust makespan. State-of-the-art approaches based on probabilistic constrained optimization lead to Mixed Integer Linear Programs that must be heuristically approximated. We optimize the robust makespan via a coherent risk measure, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Since traditional CVaR optimization approaches assuming linear spaces does not suit our problem, we propose a general branch-and-bound framework for combinatorial CVaR minimization. We then design an approximate complete algorithm, and employ resource reasoning to enable constraint propagation for multiple samples. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with higher solution quality.", "Data trustworthiness is a crucial issue in real-world participatory sensing applications. Without considering this issue, different types of worker misbehavior, especially the challenging collusion attacks, can result in biased and inaccurate estimation and decision making. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) model for spatial regression to jointly detect such misbehavior and accurately estimate the spatial field. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based algorithm to efficiently perform Bayesian inference of the model. Experiments using real-world dataset show the superior robustness of our model compared with existing approaches.", null, "In multiagent e-marketplaces, buying agents need to select good sellers by querying other buyers (called advisors). Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have shown to be an effective framework for optimally selecting sellers by selectively querying advisors. However, current solution methods do not scale to hundreds or even tens of agents operating in the e-market. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of POMDP Experts (MOPE) technique, which exploits the inherent structure of trust-based domains, such as the seller selection problem in e-markets, by aggregating the solutions of smaller sub-POMDPs. We propose a number of variants of the MOPE approach that we analyze theoretically and empirically. Experiments show that MOPE can scale up to a hundred agents thereby leveraging the presence of more advisors to significantly improve buyer satisfaction.", "Reputation systems aggregate the ratings provided by buyers to gauge the reliability of sellers in e-marketplaces. The evaluation accuracy of seller reputation significantly impacts the sellers' future utility. The existence of unfair ratings is well-recognized to negatively affect the accuracy of reputation evaluation. Most of the existing approaches dealing with unfair ratings focus on filtering/discounting/aligning the possible unfair ratings caused by malicious attacks or subjective difference. However, these approaches are not effective against unfair ratings in the form of misreporting (e.g., a well-behaving buyer misjudged a seller and provided a negative rating to a transaction which deserves a positive one, and the buyer is willing to revert the misreported negative rating). In this case, how should the buyer undo the damage caused by such misreported ratings and help the seller recover utility loss?

This paper proposes a new information source for recommender systems, called prior ratings. Prior ratings are based on users' experiences of virtual products in a mediated environment, and they can be submitted prior to purchase. A conceptual model of prior ratings is proposed, integrating the environmental factor presence whose effects on product evaluation have not been studied previously. A user study conducted in website and virtual store modalities demonstrates the validity of the conceptual model, in that users are more willing and confident to provide prior ratings in virtual environments.", "In e-marketplaces with limited inventory where buyers' demand is larger than sellers' supply, promoting honesty raises new challenges: sellers may behave dishonestly because they can sell out all products without the necessity of gaining high reputation; buyers may provide untruthful ratings to mislead other buyers in order to have a higher chance to obtain the limited products. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to promote honesty in such e-marketplaces. More specifically, our mechanism models both buyer and seller honesty. It offers higher prices to the products provided by honest sellers so that the sellers can gain more profit. Honest buyers also have a higher chance to do business with honest sellers and are able to gain more utility. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our mechanism promotes both buyer and seller honesty.

However, they often encounter difficulties in handling scalarized problems, which could cause infeasibility or repetitive nondominated points and thus induce redundant runtime. To mitigate the issue, we present a graph neural network (GNN) based method to learn the reduction rule in the ODA. We formulate the algorithmic procedure of generic ODAs as a Markov decision process, and parameterize the policy (reduction rule) with a novel two-stage GNN to fuse information from variables, constraints and especially objectives for better state representation. We train our model with imitation learning and deploy it on a state-of-the-art ODA. Results show that our method significantly improves the solving efficiency of the ODA. The learned policy generalizes fairly well to larger problems or more objectives, and the proposed GNN outperforms existing ones for integer programming in terms of test and generalization accuracy.", "The prevalence of e-commerce applications poses new trust challenges that render traditional Trust and Reputation Management (TRM) approaches inadequate. The first challenge is that TRM is built on evidence (direct or indirect observations) but evidence is becoming increasingly sparse because nowadays users have many more venues to share information. This makes it hard to derive trust models that are robust to attacks such as whitewashing and Sybil attacks. Second, the cost of attacks has reduced significantly due to the widespread presence of bots in e-commerce applications, which tends to invalidate the traditional assumption that majority users are honest. In this paper, we propose a new TRM framework called BEQA, which uses Blockchain to transform multiple disjoint and sparse sets of evidence into a single and dense evidence set. To address the second challenge, we introduce and formulate the cost of Sybil attacks using Blockchain transaction fees. In addition, we make a key observation that existing trust models have overlooked publicity (evidence originating from influencers) that exist in e-commerce applications. Thus, we formulate publicity as a whitewashing deposit such that a higher level of publicity will impose higher cost on Sybil attacks.", "Ratings provided by advisors can help an advisee to make decisions, e.g., which seller to select in e-commerce. Unfair rating attacks-where dishonest ratings are provided to mislead the advisee-impact the accuracy of decision making. Current literature focuses on specific classes of unfair rating attacks, which does not provide a complete picture of the attacks. We provide the first formal study that addresses all attack behavior that is possible within a given system. We propose a probabilistic modeling of rating behavior, and apply information theory to quantitatively measure the impact of attacks. In particular, we can identify the attack with the worst impact. In the simple case, honest advisors report the truth straightforwardly, and attackers rate strategically. In real systems, the truth (or an advisor's view on it) may be subjective, making even honest ratings inaccurate.

It is thus crucial to evaluate to what extent mechanisms can resist agents\u2019 bounded rationality, termed robustness. In this paper, we propose a general empirical framework for robustness evaluation. One novelty of our framework is to develop a robustness formulation that is generally applicable to different types of incentive mechanisms and bounded rationality models. This formulation considers not only the incentives to agents but also the performance of mechanisms. The other novelty lies in converting the empirical robustness computation into a continuum-armed bandit problem, and then developing an efficient solver that has theoretically guaranteed error rate upper bound. We also conduct extensive experiments using various mechanisms to verify the advantages and practicability of our robustness evaluation framework.", "The main function of e-commerce platforms is to guide buyer impressions to sellers, where a buyer impression means the exposure to one buyer. Currently, buyer impressions in e-commerce are allocated through a highly complex ranking system which selects top-k sellers based on their quality scores and how good they can match buyers\u2019 queries and preferences [17, 20]. In reality, more buyer impressions often give rise to more sales, and the ranking system often prefers popular sellers as they can potentially bring more sales for the platform. Thus, with the goal of increasing sales, some sellers fraudulently boost their popularity by, for example, hiring a group of human labors to visit their shops frequently or buy items from their shops and give good feedbacks [19]. In this way, these fraud sellers can gain unfair advantages over others, which jeopardizes the business environment of the platform. To keep the market fair, the platform must take away some buyer impressions from these fraud sellers. On the other hand, these fraud sellers also contribute a certain amount of normal transactions to the platform. In addition, the fraud detection techniques used to identify fraud sellers are possible to make false positive decisions. Hence, reducing the buyer impressions of fraud sellers too much may mistakenly kill some normal transactions, which will cause the total transactions of the platform to decline. With all these factors considered, it is a long-standing challenge for e-commerce platforms to find a proper policy to regulate the buyer impressions of fraud sellers. To regulate the buyer impression of fraud sellers, previous researchers propose a few fraud\u00a0\u2026", "Link prediction is an important research issue in social networks, which can be applied in many areas, such as trust-aware business applications and viral marketing campaigns. With the rise of signed networks, the link prediction problem becomes more complex and challenging as it introduces negative relations among users. Instead of predicting future relation for a pair of users, however, the current research focuses on distinguishing whether a certain link is positive or negative, on the premise of the link existence. The situation that two users do not have relation (i.e., no-relation) is also not considered, which actually is the most common case in reality. In this paper, we redefine the link prediction problem in signed social networks by also considering \u201cno-relation\u201d as a future status of a node pair.

However, most of the previous approaches cannot deal with the activity duration uncertainty caused by time-dependent workability uncertainty.

Since this is a hard discrete stochastic optimization problem, we propose an approximation approach based on Sample Average Approximation (SAA), and develop a branch-and-bound algorithm to optimally solve the SAA problem. Empirical results on benchmark problem instances and real-world distribution data show that our approach outperforms the best general-purpose POS generation approaches that do not exploit the stochastic knowledge.", "Item category has proven to be useful additional information to address the data sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems. Although categories have been well studied in which they are independent and structured in a flat form, in many real applications, item category is often organized in a richer knowledge structure - category hierarchy, to reflect the inherent correlations among different categories. In this paper, we propose a novel latent factor model by exploiting category hierarchy from the perspectives of both users and items for effective recommendation. Specifically, a user can be influenced by her preferred categories in the hierarchy. Similarly, an item can be characterized by the associated categories in the hierarchy. We incorporate the influence that different categories have towards a user and an item in the hierarchical structure.

In particular, we introduce two methods, a basic and a general similarity measures, corresponding to whether two CP-nets share similar structures and contents or not.

In the context of crowdsourcing applications for spatial interpolation (ie spatial regression) using crowdsourced data, the results can be seriously affected if malicious data sources initiate a colluding (collaborate) attacks which purposely alter some of the measurements. To combat this serious detrimental effect, and to mitigate such attacks, we develop a robust version via a Gaussian Process mixture model and develop a computationally efficient algorithm which utilises a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based methodology to produce an accurate predictive inference in the presence of collusion attacks. The algorithm is fully Bayesian and produces posterior predictive distribution for any point-of-interest in the input space. It also assesses the trustworthiness of each worker, ie the probability of each worker being honest (trustworthy). Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of this algorithm.", "In this paper, we offer an algorithm for intelligent decision making about travel path planning in mobile vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), for scenarios where agents representing vehicles exchange reports about traffic. One challenge that arises is how best to model the trustworthiness of those traffic reports. To this end, we outline an algorithm for effectively soliciting, receiving and analyzing the trustworthiness of these reports, to drive a vehicle\u2019s decision about the path to follow. Distinct from earlier work, we clarify the need for specifying the conditions under which reports are exchanged and for processing non-binary reports, culminating in a proposed algorithm to achieve that processing, as part of the trust modeling and path planning. To validate our approach we then offer a detailed evaluation framework that achieves large scale simulation of traffic, travel and reporting of information, confirming the value of our proposed approach by demonstrating the average speed of vehicles which follow our algorithm (compared to ones that do not).

In particular, we focus on allowing peers to provide annotations of learning objects. We revisit a procedure developed to select which annotations to present to students in order to improve their learning: one that combines a modeling of the reputation of the annotation (based on its approval or disapproval by previous students), the reputability of the annotator (based on the reputation of all annotations left by the student) and the similarity of the raters with the new student. Our focus is on developing effective validation of the procedure\u2019s benefit, using an approach of simulated student learning. This is achieved by developing algorithms in greater detail and then making particular design decisions for the simulation in order to manage the reputability of the annotators and annotations in a way that enables the best learning objects to be employed for the tutoring.

Extreme diversity of open and dynamic electronic marketplaces causes difficulties in handling unfair ratings in trust management systems. To ease this problem, we propose a novel incentive mechanism for eliciting fair ratings of sellers from buyers. In our mechanism, buyers model other buyers, using an approach that combines both private and public reputation values. In addition, however, sellers model the reputation of buyers. Reputable buyers provide fair ratings of sellers, and are likely considered trustworthy by many other buyers. In marketplaces operating with our mechanism, sellers will offer more attractive products to satisfy reputable buyers, in order to build their reputation. In consequence, our mechanism creates incentives for buyers to provide fair ratings of sellers, leading to more effective e-marketplaces where honest buyers and sellers can gain more profit.", "The relationship between trust and familiarity has been clarified through a value-centric trust model.

To increase the stability, we propose an improved familiarity measurement based on the exploration of factors that affect human familiarity, and the mapping from those factors to the properties of agent societies. The trust model is examined within the context of a multiagent system (MAS) based on an e-commerce framework. Experiments are also carried out to compare the stability of the trust model with the improved familiarity measurement and with the fixed familiarity value.

Specifically, our MVGCL first leverages graph contrastive learning to extract transferable patterns from VRP graphs to attain the generalizable multi-view (ie node and graph) representation. Then it adopts the learnt node embedding and graph embedding to assist the neural heuristic and the active search (during inference) for route construction, respectively. Extensive experiments on randomly generated VRP instances of various distributions, and the ones from TSPLib and CVRPLib show that our MVGCL is superior to the baselines in boosting the cross-distribution generalization performance.", "Catastrophic forgetting has been a significant problem hindering the deployment of deep learning algorithms in the continual learning setting. Numerous methods have been proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting problem where an agent loses its generalization power of old tasks while learning new tasks. We put forward an alternative strategy to handle the catastrophic forgetting with knowledge amalgamation (CFA), which learns a student network from multiple heterogeneous teacher models specializing in previous tasks and can be applied to current offline methods. The knowledge amalgamation process is carried out in a single-head manner with only a selected number of memorized samples and no annotations. The teachers and students do not need to share the same network structure, allowing heterogeneous tasks to be adapted to a compact or sparse data representation.

Different from value-based and policy gradientbased approaches like Deep Q-Networks (DQN)[27], Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)[26], and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)[33], CEM has several advantages [21, 32, 36]: 1) it is easy to implement; 2) the evolutionary nature of CEM in population selection leads to fast convergence and the sampling", "Trust and reputation management (TRM) plays an increasingly important role in large-scale online environments such as multi-agent systems (MAS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). One main objective of TRM is to achieve accurate trust assessment of entities such as agents or IoT service providers. However, this encounters an accuracy-privacy dilemma as we identify in this paper, and we propose a framework called Context-aware Bernoulli Neural Network based Reputation Assessment (COBRA) to address this challenge. COBRA encapsulates agent interactions or transactions, which are prone to privacy leak, in machine learning models, and aggregates multiple such models using a Bernoulli neural network to predict a trust score for an agent. COBRA preserves agent privacy and retains interaction contexts via the machine learning models, and achieves more accurate trust prediction than a fully-connected neural network alternative. COBRA is also robust to security attacks by agents who inject fake machine learning models; notably, it is resistant to the 51-percent attack. The performance of COBRA is validated by our experiments using a real dataset, and by our simulations, where we also show that COBRA outperforms other state-of-the-art TRM systems.", "In agent-based simulation, emergent equilibrium describes the macroscopic steady states of agents' interactions. While the state of individual agents might be changing, the collective behavior pattern remains the same in macroscopic equilibrium states. Traditionally, these emergent equilibriums are calculated using Monte Carlo methods. However, these methods require thousands of repeated simulation runs, which are extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel three-layer framework to efficiently compute emergent equilibriums. The framework consists of a macro-level pseudo-arclength equilibrium solver (PAES), a micro-level simulator (MLS) and a macro-micro bridge (MMB). It can adaptively explore parameter space and recursively compute equilibrium states using the predictor-corrector scheme. We apply the framework to the popular opinion dynamics and labour market models. The experimental results show that our framework outperformed Monte Carlo experiments in terms of computation efficiency while maintaining the accuracy.", "The computational trust paradigm supposes that it is possible to quantify trust relations that occur within some software systems. The paradigm covers a variety of trust systems, such as trust management systems, reputation systems and trust-based security systems. Different trust systems have different assumptions, and various trust models have been developed on top of these assumptions Typically, trust models are incomparable, or even mutually unintelligible; as a result their evaluation may be circular or biased. We propose a unified language to express the trust models and trust systems. Within the language, all trust models are comparable, and the problem of circularity or bias is mitigated. Moreover, given a complete set of assumptions in the language, a unique trust model is defined.", "Competitive markets in supply chains choose not to share their inventory, backlog, and revenue costs and hence global information is not available. In this paper, we propose a new framework for supply chain management based on trusted mediator agents. A mediator agent places an order on behalf of its customer to a corresponding supplier. The agents use local information and apply adaptive heuristic rules in order to enhance the performance of the entire supply chain. We have evaluated our framework through conducting extensive experiments in an agent-based modeling and simulation environment. The results show a consistent improvement in all the cases that were considered in the literature. We show that local information can in fact lead artificial mediator agents to discover effective ordering strategies.", "Service selection is one of the important problems in applications of multi-agent systems. A qualitative way is desirable for service selection according to agents' preferences on non-functional Quality of Service (QoS) attributes of services. However, it is challenging when the decision has to be made for multiple agents with preferences on attributes that may be incomplete. In this paper, first use a qualitative graphical representation tool called CP-nets to describe preference relations in a relatively compact, intuitive and structured manner. We then propose a preference reasoning algorithm to construct a derivation tree from a CP-net for each agent and then generate all service patterns for this agent. The Rank semantic is used together with the Lex semantic to provide the ordering of different service patterns. After that, we merge ranked service patterns for all agents and select a set of services that satisfy these agents\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we examine a trust-based framework for promoting honesty in e-marketplaces that relies on buyers forming social networks to share reputation ratings of sellers and sellers rewarding the buyers that are most respected within their social networks. We explore how sellers reason about expected future profit when offering particular rewards for buyers. We theoretically prove that in a marketplace operating with our mechanism: i) buyers will be better off honestly reporting seller ratings and ii) sellers are better off being honest, to earn better profit. Experiments confirm the robustness of the approach, in dynamically changing environments. With rational agents preferring to be honest, the buyer and seller strategies as specified constitute an effective approach for the design of e-marketplaces.", "Formalization of familiarity contributes to formalization of trust through a value-centric trust model. However, familiarity was assumed to be the similarity of values (fixed for two agents), and stability of the trust model was relatively low. To increase the stability, we propose an improved familiarity measurement. Experiments are carried out to compare the stability of the trust model with the improved familiarity measurement and with the fixed familiarity value. It is observed that the stability is increased by 33.47% through the improved familiarity measurement.", "The ordinary Voronoi treemap generated based on the Euclidean distance function has the flexibility to slightly adjust the layout when visualizing time-varying hierarchical data for better visual quality, preserving neighborhood relationships, and preserving a stable layout. However, its layout formed by segments with arbitrary orientations has poor shape stability between successive layouts at different time indexes, which is not conducive for the users to understand the plot and track the same node. In this paper, we propose novel Voronoi treemaps in Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance respectively, such that the segments in the new layouts only have four orientations (horizontal, vertical, and \u00b145\u00b0 to the -axis). The new layouts can not only heritage the abilities of ordinary Voronoi treemap, but preserve good shape stability. To achieve this, we first focus on the weighted bisector between two sites in\u00a0\u2026", "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) derive inspiration from recent advances in computer vision, by stacking layers of first-order filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to learn entity or graph embeddings. Although GCNs have been shown to boost the performance of many network analysis tasks, they still face tremendous challenges in learning from Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), where relations play a decisive role in knowledge reasoning. What\u2019s more, there are multiaspect representations of entities in HINs, and a filter learned in one aspect do not necessarily apply to another. We address these challenges by proposing the Aspect-Aware Graph Attention Network (AGAT), a model that extends GCNs with alternative learnable filters to incorporate entity and relational information. Instead of focusing on learning the general entity embeddings, AGAT learns the adaptive entity embeddings\u00a0\u2026", "Network slicing is a core technique of fifth-generation (5G) systems and beyond. To maximize the number of accepted network slices with limited hardware resources, service providers must avoid over-provisioning of quality-of-service (QoS), which could prevent them from lowering capital expenditures (CAPEX)/operating expenses (OPEX) for 5G infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a sub-action aided double deep Q-network (SADDQN)-based network slicing algorithm for latency-aware services. Specifically, we model network slicing as a Markov decision process (MDP), where we consider virtual network function (VNF) placements to be the actions of the MDP, and define a reward function based on cost and service priority. Furthermore, we adopt the Dijkstra algorithm to determine the forwarding graph (FG) embedding for a given VNF placement and design a resource allocation algorithm \u2013 binary search\u00a0\u2026", "Bipartite matching between two sets of objects is widely applied in many applications such as crowdsourcing marketplaces, ride-hailing services and logistics. Depending on the applications, different objectives have been proposed, resulting in different matching problems. Among them, one that is recently proposed is online bottleneck matching with delays (OBM-D), where the objective is to optimize the maximum cost of matches and the cost of a match depends on when the match is formed (i.e., it is delay-aware). Existing solutions for OBM-D usually adopt a holding strategy, which holds the objects involved in a match available for a period so as to reduce the chance that a bad match is formed. Nevertheless, existing holding strategies are all based on human-crafted rules thus cannot adapt to the dynamics of how the objects arrive. In this paper, we propose an adaptive holding strategy which is based on\u00a0\u2026", "Owing to the rapid increase of user data and development of machine learning techniques, user modeling has been explored in depth and exploited by both academia and industry. It has prominent impacts in e-commerce-related applications by facilitating users\u2019 experience in online platforms and supporting business organizations\u2019 decision-making. Among all the techniques and applications, user profiling and recommender systems are two representative and effective ones, which have also obtained growing attention. In view of its wide applications, researchers and practitioners should improve user modeling from two perspectives: (1) more effort should be devoted to obtain more user data via techniques like sensing devices and develop more effective ways to manage complex data; and (2) improving the ability of learning from a limited number of data samples (e.g., few-shot learning) has become an\u00a0\u2026", "Most of the existing proactive scheduling approaches assume the durations of activities can be described by independent random variables that have no relation with time. We deal with the more challenging problem where the duration uncertainty is related to the scheduled time period.

Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in solution quality and stability.", "Subjective opinions generalize probability distributions by including degrees of uncertainty which reflect lack of confidence in the probabilities. This paper describes a method for computing the joint subjective opinion of two variables which can be generalized to a method for computing joint subjective opinions over multiple variables in a subjective Bayesian network. We show how the joint opinions can be marginalized to provide subjective opinions on a reduced number of variables. With an example we compare the marginalization of a joint opinion with subjective logic deduction which also produces a marginal opinion.", "The ability to study complex systems has become feasible with the new intensive computing resources such as GPU, multi-core, clusters, and Cloud infrastructures. Many companies and scientific applications use multi-agent modeling and simulation platforms to study complex processes where analytical approach is not feasible. In this paper, we use two negotiation protocols to generalize the interaction behaviors between agents in multi-agent environments. The negotiation protocols are enforced by a domain-independent marketplace agent. In order to provide the agents with flexible language structure, a domain-dependent ontology is used. The integration of the domain-independent marketplace with the domain-dependent language ontology is accomplished through an automatic code generation tool. The tool simplifies deploying the framework for a specific domain of interest.

Typically, trust modeling frameworks have reasoned with binary reports from peers (ie trustworthy or not). In this paper, we illustrate how to do trust modeling when numeric advice is provided, instead (ie degree of trustworthiness within a continuum). This is done in the context of a specific application: directing the travel decisions of users with peer-provided traffic reports. We conclude with a discussion of the value of our approach for other applications as well.", "As the interest in virtual reality is growing both from academia and industry, its new application areas emerge, one of which is the virtual marketplaces. We have previously proposed that buyers may share their experience with sellers in virtual marketplaces by exchanging their feedback. The feedback is composed of terms describing merchandise based on the users\u2019 five senses. However, some of these terms (e.g., soft) may be subjective and have different semantics for different buyers. Thus, alignment of the feedback containing subjective terms becomes an indispensable step before using exchanged feedback for reputation computations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to align subjectivity in user feedback for reputation computation in virtual marketplaces. We demonstrate how sensory data in virtual reality can be exploited to handle subjectivity and describe how the aligned feedback can be\u00a0\u2026", "In this paper, we discuss some issues of extrinsic motivation in learning and argue that mechanism design can be applied on coursework grading to create incentives for student learning.

We develop precise formulations for the expected future profit sellers can realize when offering particular rewards for buyers and theoretically prove that with sellers calculating bids to sell to buyers according to our formulae: i) buyers will be better off honestly reporting seller ratings and ii) sellers are better off being honest, to earn better profit. We then revisit the proposed buyer strategy and theoretically show that limiting the sellers considered in each auction also promotes seller honesty. We ultimately focus on providing experimental evidence in defense of our incentive mechanism with the proposed seller and buyer strategies, including the added feature that buyers can come and go in the marketplace. As a result, we propose our framework as a valuable method for designing trustworthy e-marketplaces.", "In this paper, we examine the application of electronic marketplaces, populated by buying and selling agents representing their human users, learning about potential business partners and making recommendations to their users. We propose a novel incentive mechanism to address the unfair rating problem arising when modeling the trustworthiness of selling agents relies on propagation of ratings provided by buying agents. In our mechanism, buying agents model other buyers and select the most trustworthy ones as their neighbors from which they can ask advice about sellers. In order to build reputation, sellers will model the reputation of buyers based on the number of their neighborhoods and increase values of products to satisfy reputable buyers. In consequence, our mechanism creates incentive for buyers to provide fair ratings of sellers. We also discuss how a marketplace designed in this way leads to better profit both for buyers and sellers and as such fosters trust between the agents and their human users.", "Typically, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm focuses in learning a single deployable policy as the end product. Depending on the initialization methods and seed randomization, learning a single policy could possibly leads to convergence to different local optima across different runs, especially when the algorithm is sensitive to hyper-parameter tuning. Motivated by the capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in learning complex data manifold, the adversarial training procedure could be utilized to learn a population of good-performing policies instead. We extend the teacher-student methodology observed in the Knowledge Distillation field in typical deep neural network prediction tasks to RL paradigm. Instead of learning a single compressed student network, an adversarially-trained generative model (hypernetwork) is learned to output network weights of a population of good-performing policy\u00a0\u2026", "Online lot sizing for perishable materials in an uncertain environment is a fundamental problem for inventory planning and has been studied for several decades.

We present theoretical results of the best possible competitive ratio an online algorithm can achieve for the LS-PMU problem. We then develop a reinforcement learning-based algorithm called  RL4LS  to intelligently choose the supplier and decide the order quantity in each time period. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to verify that  RL4LS  outperforms existing algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, e.g.,  RL4LS  improves the effectiveness by 44\u00a0\u2026", "Conversational recommender system (CRS) enhances the recommender system by acquiring the latest user preference through dialogues, where an agent needs to decide \u201cwhether to ask or recommend\u201d, \u201cwhich attributes to ask\u201d, and \u201cwhich items to recommend\u201d in each round. To explore these questions, reinforcement learning is adopted in most CRS frameworks. However, existing studies somewhat ignore to consider the connection between the previous rounds and the current round of the conversation, which might lead to the lack of prior knowledge and inaccurate decisions. In this view, we propose to facilitate the connections between different rounds of conversations in a dialogue session through deep transformer-based multi-channel meta-reinforcement learning, so that the CRS agent can decide each action/decision based on previous states, actions, and their rewards.

It is  model-agnostic  that the encoder and the decoder can be from any pretrained neural construction method. Regarding the introduced  refiner  network, we design its architecture by combining the standard gated recurrent units (GRU) cell with two new layers, i.e., an accumulated graph attention (AGA) layer and a gated nonlinear (GNL) layer.

In fact, coarse-grained signals (i.e., region- and global-level check-ins) in such sparse check-ins would also benefit to augment user preference learning. Specifically, our data analysis unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable patterns w.r.t. the regions of visited POIs. Meanwhile, the global all-user check-ins can help reflect sequential regularities shared by the crowd. We are, therefore, inspired to propose the MCMG: a Multi-Channel next POI recommendation framework with Multi-Granularity signals categorized from two orthogonal perspectives, i.e., fine-coarse grained check-ins at either POI/region level or local/global level.

In this business model, a user can launch a GB as an initiator to share her interested product with social friends. The GB is clinched once enough friends join in as participants to copurchase the shared product. As such, a successful GB depends on not only whether the initiator can find her interested product but also whether the friends are willing to join in as participants. Most existing recommenders are incompetent in such complex scenario, as they merely seek to help users find their preferred products and cannot help identify potential participants to join in a GB. To this end, we propose a novel joint product\u2013participant recommendation (J2PRec) framework, which recommends both candidate products and participants for maximizing the success rate of a GB.

Despite its elegant design, peer prediction mechanisms often fail in practice, mostly due to two shortcomings:(1) agents\u2019 incentives for exerting effort to produce high-quality information are assumed to be known;(2) agents are modeled as being fully rational. In this paper, we propose the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework in this domain, Reinforcement Peer Prediction, to tackle these two limitations. In our framework, we develop a RL algorithm for the data requester to dynamically adjust the scaling level to maximize his revenue, and to pay workers using peer prediction scoring functions. Experiments show significant improvement in data requestor\u2019s revenue under different agent models.", "Predictions are a well-studied form of ratings. Their objective nature allows a rigourous analysis. A problem is that there are attacks on prediction systems and rating systems. These attacks decrease the usefulness of the predictions. Attackers may ignore the incentives in the system, so we may not rely on these to protect ourselves. The user must block attackers, ideally before the attackers introduce too much misinformation. We formally axiomatically define robustness as the property that no rater can introduce too much misinformation. We formally prove that notions of robustness come at the expense of other desirable properties, such as the lack of bias or effectiveness. We also show that there do exist trade-offs between the different properties, allowing a prediction system with limited robustness, limited bias and limited effectiveness.", "In this paper, we describe a framework used for decision support by intelligent agents in transportation environments: assisting drivers in making effective travel decisions based on traffic reports provided by peers.

In so doing, we are offering a framework that clarifies the representation and the messaging required to enable the trust-based decision making to be run. We demonstrate how this representation assists in the clarification of knowledge provenance and how it can be employed in real-time.

To solve this problem, we develop an automated method that uses graph search and model checking techniques to construct the optimal agent behavior with respect to a labeled transition systems model of a protocol and linear temporal logic specification of the agent's goals.

To address this problem, we propose a subjectivity alignment approach for reputation computation (SARC). It first requires the buyers to provide ratings and detailed reviews containing values of objective attributes of the transactions. After that, SARC applies Bayesian learning to model the correlations between each rating level and each objective attribute, and adopts a regression analysis model to learn the weights of the attributes, representing each buyer\u2019s subjectivity. Ratings provided by one buyer can then be aligned (converted) for another buyer according to the two buyers\u2019 subjectivity. Evaluation results indicate that SARC can more accurately and stably model sellers\u2019 reputation than the BLADE and TRAVOS approaches. It is also not much affected by deception from dishonest buyers, and more robust to dynamic environments.", "In e-marketplaces with limited inventory where buyers\u2019 demand is larger than sellers\u2019 supply, promoting honesty raises new challenges: sellers may behave dishonestly because they can sell out all products without the necessity of gaining high reputation; buyers may provide untruthful ratings to mislead other buyers in order to have a higher chance to obtain the limited products. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to promote buyer and seller honesty in such e-marketplaces. More specifically, our mechanism models both buyer and seller honesty. It offers higher prices to the products provided by honest sellers so that the sellers can gain larger utility. Honest buyers also have a higher chance to do business with honest sellers and are able to gain larger utility.

Current research on VR aims to develop a simulated reality that is realistic enough to satisfy human senses. As this technology is getting mature, its new application areas emerge, such as virtual marketplaces. Previous research has concerned about adopting virtual reality into constructing e-commerce, and validated whether and how virtual reality can influence trust and thus impact user decision making in advance [1]. Besides, there are inherited trust problems in virtual marketplaces. For instance, some sellers may be dishonest (eg, fail to deliver items as what they promised), or some sellers may have different competency (eg, provide only low quality products). In order to address the trust problem in virtual marketplaces, a fivesense oriented feedback provision approach has been proposed in our previous work [3]. The basic idea is to allow buyers to share their past experience about sellers in their feedback based on human buyers\u2019 five senses, namely, vision, sound, touch, taste and smell. Then, the reputation of sellers can be modeled based on the shared feedback. Information about five senses is synthesized by virtual reality simulators. As reported by Luca et al.[4], virtual objects can be created by copying the real products, such as using the 3D scanner to record visual information and using the haptic device to collect tactile information.
