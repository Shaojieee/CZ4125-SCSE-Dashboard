End-to-end training on vision and language data may bridge the disconnections, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Img2Prompt, a plug-and-play module that provides the prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task disconnections, so that LLMs can perform zero-shot VQA tasks without end-to-end training. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic models to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed question-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform zero-shot VQA tasks. Img2Prompt offers the following benefits: 1) It can flexibly work with various LLMs to perform VQA. 2) Without the needing of end-to-end training, it significantly reduces the cost of deploying LLM for zero-shot VQA tasks. 3) It achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end training.

Extensive experiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%.

Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing classification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric learning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper, we bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance Selection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the probability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples. Specifically, we propose a novel method, namely the von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity (vMF-Sim), to calculate this probability by estimating a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution for each data class. Compared with the existing average similarity method (AvgSim), vMF-Sim considers the variance of each class in addition to the average similarity. With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the proposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the best performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable training time."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QwL4z2UAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=QwL4z2UAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC": {"external_link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US10956685B2/en", "inventors": "Boyang Li, Pelin DOGAN", "publication_date": "2021/3/23", "patent_office": "US", "patent_number": "10956685", "application_number": "16786804", "description": "Systems, methods and computer program products related to aligning heterogeneous sequential data are disclosed.

We propose to employ (1) layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) to align the magnitudes of gradient updates in different layers and balance the pace of learning and (2) sequence-wise batch normalization (SBN) to align the internal feature distributions from different modalities. Finally, we leverage random projection to reduce the dimensionality of input features.
