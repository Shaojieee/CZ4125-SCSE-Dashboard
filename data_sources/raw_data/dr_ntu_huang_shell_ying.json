She obtained both her B.Sc(Eng) in Computing Science with Honours and her PhD from Imperial College, London.  Her research interests are in simulation based optimization heuristics, metaheuristics, computational science, computational logistics  and intelligent decision support systems.  She has been the principle investigator or co-principle investigator for a number of projects funded by Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, NSTB (now the ASTAR), GINTIC (now the SimTech), PSA International, Jurong Port Pte Ltd, Surbana Consultants, APL and NTU.  She has published about 100 publications in books, international journals and international conferences.  She was awarded the Minister\u2019s Innovation (Merit) Award by Minister for Transport of Singapore, Mr. Raymond Lim in 2007 for her contribution in the research work in optimization of container port operations.Teaching expriences:Courses she has given lectures and tutorials:  Compiler Techniques, Algorithms,  Advanced Algorithms, Simulation & Modelling,  Introduction to Programming, Discrete Mathmatics, Engineering Mathematics.Courses she has given tutorials: Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, Object-oriented Programming.Recent publications:Huang Shell Ying, Li Ya.
