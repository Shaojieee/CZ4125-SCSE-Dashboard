Emerging artificial intelligence technology is being increasingly adopted to predict stroke. Because of privacy concerns, patient data are stored in distributed electronic health record (EHR) databases, voluminous clinical datasets, which prevent patient data from being aggregated and restrains AI technology to boost the accuracy of stroke prediction with centralized training data. In this work, our scientists and engineers propose a privacy-preserving scheme to predict the risk of stroke and deploy our federated prediction model on cloud servers.

It adopts federated averaging during the model training process, without patient data being taken out of the hospitals during the whole process of model training and forecasting. With the privacy-preserving mechanism, our federated prediction model trains over all the healthcare data from hospitals in a certain city without actual data sharing among them. Therefore, it is not only secure but also more accurate than any single prediction model that trains over the data only from one single hospital. Especially for small hospitals with few confirmed stroke cases, our federated model boosts model performance by 10%~20% in several machine learning metrics.

It can perform contribution evaluations 2.84 times faster than the best existing approach, and has improved the average accuracy of the resulting models by 2.62% compared to the previous system (which is significant in industrial settings).

Existing TL approaches mostly assume that training data from the source domain are collected from multiple views or devices. However, in practical applications, a sample in a target domain often only corresponds to a specific view or device. Without the ability to mitigate the influence of the many unrelated samples, the performance of existing TL approaches may deteriorate for such learning tasks. This problem will be exacerbated if the intrinsic relationships among the source domain samples are unclear. Currently, there is no mechanism for determining the intrinsic characteristics of samples in order to treat them differently during TL.

Despite the significant body of work on self driving technology, many people are still sceptical about the idea of riding in a fully autonomous vehicle (AV).

Existing model-heterogeneous FL approaches often require publicly available datasets and incur high communication and/or computational costs, which limit their performances.

However, HE incurs high computation and communication costs among FL participants, which increase exponentially with the number of participants. Thus, existing VFL methods are unsuitable for multi-party scenarios. Moreover, in VFL scenarios, it is difficult to establish an FL server that can be trusted by all participants. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient Multi-participant Vertical Federated Learning approach based on Secret Sharing (MVFLS). On the one hand, it uses secret sharing instead of homomorphic encryption, which effectively reduces the computational cost. On the other hand, benefiting from secret sharing, it enables VFL to be performed in multi-participant scenarios while eliminating the dependence on having an FL server. This can further reduce the risk of data leakage on the server side and effectively protect the security of participants.

In addition, we incorporate two KL-divergence constraints within this probabilistic modeling framework to surmount the intricacies of managing extensive search spaces and accomplishing cross-domain personalization of CoTs.

Its ability to dynamically adapt to changing business objectives has resulted in significant business advantages.

Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local logic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates, to the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper logical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without requiring access to the raw data.

The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable human experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence improving the global FL model's robustness to errors.

Under peak usage during the Single\u2019s Day Shopping Festival (November 11th) in 2017, CFS reduced the average search latency by 20% compared to the previous approach."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eXgoTXMAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eXgoTXMAAAAJ:hXZnTIgIr50C": {"external_link": "https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/15096", "authors": ["Yongqing Zheng", "Han Yu", "Yuliang Shi", "Kun Zhang", "Shuai Zhen", "Lizhen Cui", "Cyril Leung", "Chunyan Miao"], "publication_date": "2021/6", "journal": "AI Magazine", "volume": "42", "issue": "2", "pages": "28\u201337", "publisher": "AAAI Press", "description": "As demand for electricity grows in China, the existing power grid is coming under increasing pressure.

Currently, the lack of systematic pain management training and support among primary care doctors limits their ability to provide quality care for chronic patients. With the advent of deep learning, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Medicine has inspired a range of research on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). To empower nonspecialist primary care doctors to provide better care for chronic pain patients, we develop a decision support system leveraging EHR data. The core AI engine of this system is a discriminator-based autoencoder neural network that can achieve good representation performance on small scale datasets to help primary care doctors search for similar chronic pain cases previously treated by specialists. The system has been beta-tested on a dataset collected from 440 chronic pain patients together with doctors from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, and has shown promising results.

Over the past decade, the importance of trust management in computational intelligence research (e.g. in multi-agent systems (MASs)) has been recognized by both the industry and the academia. Computational trust models for evaluating the trustworthiness of a trustee agent based on a wide range of evidence have been proposed. Nevertheless, two important research problems remain open in this field. Firstly, how to mitigate the adverse effects of biased third-party testimonies on the accuracy of evaluating the trustworthiness of an agent? Secondly, how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to efficiently utilize the capacities of trustee agents to achieve high social welfare? This thesis presents the research into addressing these two problems. It first proposes a novel reinforcement learning based trust evidence aggregation model \u2013 namely the Actor-Critic Trust (ACT) model \u2013 to address the problem of biased testimonies. Individual truster agents can use the ACT model to dynamically learn to adjust the selection of witness agents, the weights given to each of their testimonies, as well as the weights given to the collective opinions of the witness agents and the first-hand trust evidence to produce a trustworthiness evaluation. The model operates according to observable changes in the MAS environment and has been shown to be robust against collusions among witness agents. The ACT model eliminates the need for manually tuning these weight parameters in most existing trust models and makes agents more\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eXgoTXMAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=eXgoTXMAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C": {"external_link": null, "authors": ["Han Yu"], "publication_date": "2005", "conference": "The Annual SIGRAD Conference (SIGRAD'05)", "pages": "69-73", "publisher": "Link\u00f6ping University Electronic Press, Link\u00f6pings"}}
