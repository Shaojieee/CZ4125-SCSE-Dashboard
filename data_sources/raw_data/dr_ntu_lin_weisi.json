He taught and researched in Sun Yat-Sen University, Shantou University (China), Bath University (UK), National University of Singapore, Institute of Microelectronics (Singapore), and Institute for Infocomm Research (Singapore). He has been the project leader of 10+ successfully delivered projects in digital multimedia technology development. He also served as the Lab Head, Visual Processing, and then the Acting Department Manager, Media Processing, in Institute for Infocomm Research.  He holds 16 patents, wrote 9 book chapters, edited 3 books,  authored 2 books, published over 400 refereed papers in international journals and conferences, and made more than ten contributions to international standardization. He believes that good theory is practical so has kept a balance of academic research and industrial deployment throughout his working life.", "interests": "perception-inspired signal modeling, visual quality evaluation, video compression, image processing & analysis, multimedia systems", "grants": "Artificial Intelligence Programme in ChinaDeep learning and 3D technologies for scene understanding and modellingFull Multimedia Perception and Understanding [COE Research Award 2023]LiDAR Depth Map (LDM) Quality Assessment & ImprovementOverheads M4 AccountScent Digitalization and Computation (SDC)WP4: Scent Digitalization and Computation (SDC)- PI: Guan CuntaiWP4: Scent Digitalization and Computation (SDC)- PI: Lin Weisi", "articles": ["Lin, W., & Kuo, C.
