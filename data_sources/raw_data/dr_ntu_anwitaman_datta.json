He currently teaches courses on Developing Data Products, Security Management and Distributed Systems. Additionally, he serves as a Senior Scientific Officer in a consulting role with QPQ.IO.He did his undergraduate studies at IIT Kanpur, India, and his doctoral dissertation at EPFL Switzerland. During 2014-2018 he was a non-executive director of Qiv Storage Pte Ltd (which he had co-founded).", "interests": "My research interests span the topics of large-scale resilient distributed systems, information security and applications of data analytics. Some of my distinctive and pioneering research contributions which have preceded and influenced new lines of research in respective research communities include: (i) decentralized online social networks for privacy and censorship resistance, (ii) novel erasure codes tailor made for distributed storage systems --- self-repairing (locally repairable) erasure codes, erasure codes with elastic redundancy, and codes exploiting cross-version sparsity to efficiently store multiple versions of data, and (iii) the application of machine learning and stereotyping to computational trust. I have also contributed to well established research topics, spanning security and privacy, distributed data stores, collaborative systems, social network analysis, decision support applications and cryptocurrency forensics.", "grants": "BlockChain I/O: A framework for cross-chain interoperabilityDataGovernR: Governance of Research Data", "articles": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier, Anwitaman Datta (2013).
