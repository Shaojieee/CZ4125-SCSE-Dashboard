The downlink transmission often suffers from its short range and vulnerability to interference, which limits the practical application and deployment of backscatter communication systems.

Passive DSSS is able to increase the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by using direct sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) techniques to suppress interference and noise. The key challenge lies in the demodulation of DSSS signals, where the conventional solutions require power-hungry computations to synchronize a locally generated spreading code with the received DSSS signal, which is infeasible on energy-constrained backscatter devices. Passive DSSS addresses such a challenge by shifting the generation and synchronization of the spreading code from the receiver to the gateway side, and therefore achieves ultra-low power DSSS demodulation. We prototype passive DSSS for proof of concept.

To ensure reliable data transfer, LoRaWAN adopts retransmission mechanism where an unacknowledged packet is retransmitted multiple times in the hope of successfully delivering the packet at least once over harsh wireless channels. This retransmission mechanism is ill-suited for LoRa: 1) unsuccessful retransmissions lead to high power consumption for battery-powered LoRa nodes, and 2) a retransmission at another time does not necessarily improve the signal strength over harsh wireless channels. This paper presents the design and implementation of XCopy, which effectively improves the signal strength by coherently combining retransmitted packets received over weak links that would otherwise be thrown away. XCopy develops and puts together novel algorithms to 1) accurately identify the signal copies of the same packet over multiple retransmissions in the presence of interfering packets, and 2) precisely align the signal copies (in time, frequency, and phase) to ensure constructive combining, which turns out to be very challenging in ultra-low SNRs, but made possible by XCopy. Evaluations show that XCopy can deliver significant SNR gains and yield higher packet reception ratio and longer lifetime of LoRa nodes."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kjiwE6IAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=kjiwE6IAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC": {"external_link": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05933-9_4", "authors": ["Xiaoyun Mo", "Mingqian Li", "Mo Li"], "publication_date": "2022/5/10", "book": "Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "pages": "41-53", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "description": "Abnormal events in rail systems, including train service delays and disruptions, are pains of the public transit system that have plagued urban cities for many years.

It is challenging, however, to perform route planning over a large number of students each having multiple potential pickup locations. We develop a graph-based data structure that embeds potential pickup locations of all students with the awareness of real-world constraints and existing public transits. Based on the graph structure, we prove that the optimal last-mile school shuttle planning problem is NP-hard and thereafter design a Tabu-based expansion algorithm to solve the problem, which strikes at a proper balance between the savings of students\u2019 commute time and the total cost of operating the shuttle buses.
