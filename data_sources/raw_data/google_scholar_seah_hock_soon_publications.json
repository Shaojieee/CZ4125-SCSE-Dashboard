Though 3D object detection can provide an object-level environmental description to fill this gap, a robot always encounters incomplete object observation, recurring detections of the same object, error in detection, or intersection between objects when conducting detection continuously in a cluttered room. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage 3D object detection algorithm which is to fuse multiple views of 3D object point clouds in the first stage and to eliminate unreasonable and intersection detections in the second stage. For each view, the robot performs a 2D object semantic segmentation and obtains 3D object point clouds. Then, an unsupervised segmentation method called Locally Convex Connected Patches (LCCP) is utilized to segment the object accurately from the background. Subsequently, the Manhattan Frame estimation is implemented to calculate the main orientation of the object and subsequently, the 3D object bounding box can be obtained. To deal with the detected objects in multiple views, we construct an object database and propose an object fusion criterion to maintain it automatically. Thus, the same object observed in multi-view is fused together and a more accurate bounding box can be calculated. Finally, we propose an object filtering approach based on prior knowledge to remove incorrect and intersecting objects in the object dataset.

Therefore, in physically based caustic rendering, we need to take into account spectral information. However, this may lead to prohibitive running time.

Our acceleration scheme takes into account information across visible wavelengths of the scene, that is, the index of refraction (IOR) (caustic object), light power (light), and material reflectance (surface). To process visible wavelengths effectively, firstly we cluster the wavelengths which have similar first refraction (air to caustic object) directions.

We then propose our AR applications enhanced by the integration of MEC and FiWi access, which can provide multiple low-latency AR services.

Our acceleration scheme takes into account information across visible wavelengths of the scene, that is, the index of refraction (IOR) (caustic object), light power (light), and material reflectance (surface). To process visible wavelengths effectively, firstly we cluster the wavelengths which have similar first refraction (air to caustic object) directions. In this way, all the wavelengths in a cluster can be represented by one light ray during rendering. Secondly, by considering the surrounding objects (their material reflectance from and visible surface area of the caustic objects) and light power, we compute the refinement amount of each wavelength cluster.

The existing computer-generated lines, such as suggestive contours, apparent ridges, and demarcating curves, adopt the two-pass framework: in the first pass, certain geometric features or properties are extracted or computed in the object space; then in the second pass, the line drawings are rendered by iterating each polygonal face or edge. It is known these approaches are very sensitive to the mesh quality, and usually require appropriate preprocessing operations (e.g. smoothing, remeshing, etc.) to the input meshes. This paper presents a simple yet robust approach to generate view-dependent line drawings for 3D models. Inspired by the image edge detector, we compute the difference-of-Gaussian of illumination on the 3D model. With moderate assumption, we show all the expensive computations can be done in the pre-computing stage. Our method naturally integrates object- and image-spaces in that we compute the geometric features in the object space and then adopt a simple fragment shader to render the lines in the image space. As a result, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing object-space approaches, since the lines are generated in a single pass without iterating the mesh edges/faces.

We introduce strategies to compute multiple camera-based 3D optical flow and have attained efficient and robust 3D motion estimation. Body pose estimation starts with a prediction using 3D optical flow and then is changed to a lower-dimensional global optimization problem.

The outlines of characters or objects on two key-frames are used as inputs. First, a skeleton linkage of the target object is automatically constructed by rasterizing each of input key-frames and then applying a pixel-based skeleton extraction method. Secondary, a pair of skeleton linkages having corresponding structure between the current key-frame and the next key-frame is constructed by applying the stroke matching algorithm. After these processes, motion transitions between the skeleton linkages are generated based on our simulation model. When the in-between frames are created only in the 2D plane, the outlines at in-between frames can be generated by a 2D deformation. In case that the in-between transitions are containing a rotation around an axis which is no perpendicular to the drawing plane, however, a 3D structure is required. For achieving such in-between transitions, our method constructs a 3D structure by inflating 2D mesh based on the input outlines. Finally, the contours from the view-point for the created 3D structure are projected onto the 2D plane during in-between transitions. In our method, we adopt the Photic Extremum Lines (PEL) to extract the 2D contours from the obtained 3D shape. In this way, we achieve the in-between creation containing spatial rotation such as hand-flipping, which has not been achieved by general ways of in-between creation method."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5973809/", "authors": ["Lu Dong", "Weisi Lin", "Ce Zhu", "Hock Soon Seah"], "publication_date": "2011/6/14", "conference": "2011 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE)", "pages": "183-187", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "In this work, a sample rate estimator is proposed for selective graphics rendering so that the samples are allocated such that the best perceived image quality can be achieved under a given sample budget.

Effective use of this imaging modality in clinics largely depends on the capability of real-time 3D image reconstruction, cell and tissue feature detection, and rendering. To match the video rate of image streaming, the online detection and rendering of the volumetric features implied by the cellular images has been proven technically challenging. Upon a comprehensive survey and comparative analysis, in this paper, we present a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 3D feature detection and rendering, for an interactive visualization of the endomicroscopic images. We preprocess the acquired datasets by employing mathematical morphology with multiple render targets in a multi-pass approach on the GPU.

The mechanism and GPU implementation techniques for dynamically generation of the transfer functions are presented.

Existing works addressing route queries mainly focus on static road networks rather than timeaware road networks. Observe the fact that the same road segment can be driven at different speeds during different time intervals, and users usually prefer driving on a route that consumes minimum energy within a travel time budget. Motivated by this, this paper studies the energy-efficient time-aware routing problem in road networks, denoted as EETAR. We take time factor into consideration and utilize a piecewise constant speed model to calculate the travel time along each road segment with different departure time. We also utilize a polynomial energy cost model to compute the energy consumption along each road segment with different departure time. As the problem of EETAR is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable approximation bounds to answer the route queries in real-world dense road networks. In addition, we also devise a greedy route planning algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms can answer EETAR queries efficiently."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6QTmlnAAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=6QTmlnAAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15368289455149606255&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Jianmin Zheng", "Hock Soon Seah", "De-Wei Randall Lim"], "description": "In this paper we propose a method for encoding hand-drawn images based on a parametric B\u00e9zier representation.

Polycube Geometry Images is a global surface parameterization technique such that the parametric domain is a Polycube (cubical complex). Polycube is a highly regular structure that describes the 3D surface topology and geometry while keeping consistency of surface with low distortion. By unfolding the Polycube adjacent facets, 3D surface attributes, such as color and normal, can be stored and accessed in the Polycube Geometry Images as 2D image. For example, painting and applying image processing via Polycube Geometry Images on 3D surface indirectly.

For the traditional cartoon animation, artists and animators spend tremendous amount of time on drawing and painting frames. For 3D animation, artists first draft the storyboard and design characters. After that, programmers/artists model the characters, backgrounds, animate and render scenes with software tools like Maya or 3D Studio Max. The whole process is rather tedious and demands high computation power. To improve this"}}
