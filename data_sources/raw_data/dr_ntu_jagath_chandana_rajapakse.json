He has BSc degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Moratuwa (UM), Sri Lanka, and MS and PhD degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University at Buffalo (UB), USA. He was Visiting Scientist to the Max-Planck Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Germany, and the National Institute of Mental Health, USA. He was Visiting Professor to the Department of Biological Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).He serves as Editor for Engineering Applications in Artificial Intelligence journal (IF = 7.802) and served as Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on medical imaging, IEEE Transaction on neural networks and learning systems, and IEEE Transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics. He was a Fulbright Scholar and appointed IEEE Fellow in 2012 in recognition of his contributions to brain image analysis.", "interests": "Professor Rajapakse\u2019s research works are in the areas of data science, machine learning, brain imaging, and computational and systems biology. He has published over 300 peer-reviewed research articles in high-impact journals and conferences. His research articles have been cited over 14,000 times on Google Scholar. He was recently ranked among the top 2% scientists globally by Stanford Study. His current research focus on developing techniques and tools for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases. He develops tools to detect and segment brain structures, lesions, and tumours from CT and MRI scans with deep learning technologies. He investigates the connectome from functional MRI and DTI scans for disease identification and biomarker discovery. He is also looking into how neuroimaging data can be integrated with multi-omics (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics) data for investigating neurological and psychiatric diseases.", "grants": "Decoding the connectome by deep encoding on graphsDeep generative approach for de novo cancer drug discovery with desired mechanism of actionDeveloping Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for Discovering Novel Ocular and Brain Imaging Biomarkers of Alzheimer\u2019s DiseaseMachine learning for Demand ForecastingNovel methods of network modelling and personalised machine learning to understand and predict individual dementia using heterogeneous multi-omics dataNovel MRI Toolbox to Classify and Predict Asian Mild Cognitive ImpairmentSoftware Application for Thermal imaging analytics", "articles": ["2.
