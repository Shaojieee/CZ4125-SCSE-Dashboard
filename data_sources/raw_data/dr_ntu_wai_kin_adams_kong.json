He has developed three patents, of which, one has been approved while two others have been filed. During his course of study, he has also gone to win the Scholastic Award from the Hong Kong Baptist University - an award presented only to the top student in his department. As a finalist of the 4th Young Inventor Awards 2002-2003, organized by Hewlett Packard and Far Eastern Economic Review, this capable inventor has received resounding media coverage for his \u201cPalm Print Identification Algorithms for Real-Time Personal Identification\u201d.    This palmprint identification system has earned several international and national awards.  It has aslo been applied to several real applications, including the control of access to a laboratory and a hotel. He has recently been listed as one of the \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d in the World.", "interests": "His major research interests include pattern recognition, image processing and biometric security.", "grants": "Development of Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) Aircraft in SingaporeDigital Trust Centre (a.k.a.
