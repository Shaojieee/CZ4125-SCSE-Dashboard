As the data underlying infodemiology are fundamentally huge graphs and statistical in nature, there are computational challenges to the design of graph algorithms and algorithmic speedup. A framework that leverages cloud computing is key to designing scalable data analytics for infodemic control. This paper proposes the MEGA framework, which is a novel joint hierarchical clustering and parallel computing technique that can be used to process a variety of computational tasks in large graphs. Its unique feature lies in using statistical machine learning to exploit the inherent statistics of data to accelerate computation. Our MEGA framework consists of first pruning, followed by hierarchical clustering based on geodesic distance and then parallel computing, lending itself readily to parallel computing software, e.g., MapReduce or Hadoop. In particular, we illustrate how our MEGA framework computes two representative graph problems for infodemic control, namely network motif counting for community detection and network centrality computation for rumor source detection. Interesting special cases of optimal tuning in the MEGA framework are identified based on geodesic distance characterization and random graph model analysis. Finally, we evaluate its performance using cloud software implementation and real-world graph datasets to demonstrate its computational efficiency over existing state of the art.", "total_citations": {"2023": 2}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2CBtcAAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=G2CBtcAAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2667522.2667541", "authors": ["Liang Zheng", "Chee Wei Tan"], "publication_date": "2014/9/4", "journal": "ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review", "volume": "42", "issue": "2", "pages": "58-60", "publisher": "ACM", "description": "How do we efficiently and fairly allocate the resource in a wireless network?

As the data underlying infodemiology are fundamentally huge graphs and statistical in nature, there are computational challenges to the design of graph algorithms and algorithmic speedup. A framework that leverages cloud computing is key to designing scalable data analytics for infodemic control. This paper proposes the MEGA framework, which is a novel joint hierarchical clustering and parallel computing technique that can be used to process a variety of computational tasks in large graphs. Its unique feature lies in using statistical machine learning to exploit the inherent statistics of data to accelerate computation. Our MEGA framework consists of first pruning, followed by hierarchical clustering based on geodesic distance and then parallel computing, lending itself readily to parallel computing software, eg, MapReduce or Hadoop. In particular, we illustrate how our MEGA framework computes two representative graph problems for infodemic control, namely network motif counting for community detection and network centrality computation for rumor source detection. Interesting special cases of optimal tuning in the MEGA framework are identified based on geodesic distance characterization and random graph model analysis. Finally, we evaluate its performance using cloud software implementation and real-world graph datasets to demonstrate its computational efficiency over existing state of the art."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2CBtcAAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=G2CBtcAAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC": {"external_link": "https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/publication(41edf440-b837-4256-b541-995d811d23a9).html", "authors": ["Y-W Peter Hong", "Liang Zheng", "Chee Wei Tan"], "publication_date": "2018/3", "book": "Cognitive Radio Networks: Performance, Applications and Technology", "pages": "123-152", "publisher": "Nova Science Publisher Inc.", "description": "This chapter presents a systematic approach for solvingmax-min utility fair power control problems in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with general monotonic constraints, such as power constraints and interference temperature constraints.

Under the cell partitioned network model, we study the capacity and delay for the primary networks under two communication schemes: Non-cooperative Scheme and Cooperative Scheme. The communication pattern considered for the secondary network is Cooperative Scheme. Given that m= n\u03b2 (\u03b2> 1), we show that per-node capacity O (1/kp) 1 and O (1/ks\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G2CBtcAAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=G2CBtcAAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=70624230071183568&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Yan Gao", "Chee Wei Tan", "Ying Huang", "Zheng Zeng", "PR Kumar"], "description": "Due to the rapid growth of real-time applications and the ubiquity of IEEE 802.11 MAC as a layer-2 protocol for wireless local area networks (WLANs), it is of increasing interest to support delay-based quality of service (QoS) in such WLANs. In this paper, we develop a simple but accurate enough analytical model for predicting queueing delay in non-homogeneous random access based WLANs. This leads to tractable solutions for meeting queueing delay specifications of a number of flows. Using this model, we address the feasibility problem of whether the mean delays required by a set of inelastic flows can be guaranteed in WLANs. Based on the model and feasibility analysis, we further develop an optimization technique to minimize the delays for inelastic flows. Moreover, we present a decentralized algorithm and report its implementation and present extensive simulation and experimental trace-based results to\u00a0\u2026"}}
