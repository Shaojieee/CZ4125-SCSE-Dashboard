A major challenge faced by learning-based approaches is that usually only one ground truth training instance per label. As such, sampling from conditional VAEs still leads to minimal diversity. To overcome this, we propose a novel and probabilistically principled framework with two parallel paths. One is a reconstructive path that utilizes the only one given ground truth to get prior distribution of missing parts and rebuild the original image from this distribution. The other is a generative path for which the conditional prior is coupled to the distribution obtained in the reconstructive path. Both are supported by GANs. We also introduce a new short+ long term attention layer that exploits distant relations among decoder and encoder features, improving appearance consistency.

In particular, Sem2NeRF addresses the highly challenging task by encoding the semantic mask into the latent code that controls the 3D scene representation of a pre-trained decoder. To further improve the accuracy of the mapping, we integrate a new region-aware learning strategy into the design of both the encoder and the decoder. We verify the efficacy of the proposed Sem2NeRF\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2021": 1, "2022": 11, "2023": 14}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC": {"external_link": "https://www.academia.edu/download/38835663/phi05.pdf", "authors": ["Minh-Tri Pham", "Tat-Jen Cham"], "publication_date": "2005", "journal": "Proc. of CVPR", "volume": "9", "pages": "11", "description": "This paper investigates how the speed of an object detector can be rapidly increased through a caching framework when input sequences are quasi-repetitive.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in the continuous domain have shown a capability to capture the global context, while generating high-quality images. In the discrete state space, some works have demonstrated the potential to perform text generation and low resolution image generation. We show that with the help of a content-rich discrete visual codebook from VQ-VAE, the discrete diffusion model can also generate high fidelity images with global context, which compensates for the deficiency of the classical autoregressive model along pixel space. Meanwhile, the integration of the discrete VAE with the diffusion model resolves the drawback of conventional autoregressive models being oversized, and the diffusion model which demands excessive time in the sampling process when generating images. It is found that the quality of the generated images is heavily dependent on the discrete visual codebook.

While this approach has some success in rendering glossy surfaces, translucent objects are still poorly represented. In this paper, we present an alternative to the physics-based VR approach by introducing a self-attention-based framework on volumes along a ray.

We also show that the bound is a generalization of one of the latest (and tightest) bounds on the classification error of the combined classifier."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C": {"external_link": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24028-7_8", "authors": ["Xiao Teng", "Tat-Jen Cham"], "publication_date": "2011", "journal": "Advances in Visual Computing", "pages": "78-89", "publisher": "Springer Berlin/Heidelberg", "description": "We propose and analyze an example-based framework for relighting images. In this framework, there are a number of images of reference objects captured under different illumination conditions. Given an input image of a new object captured under one of the previously observed illumination conditions, new images can be synthesized for the input object under all the other illumination conditions that are present in the reference images. It does not require any other prior knowledge on the reference and target objects, except that they share the same albedo. Though it is appreciated if the reference objects have similar shape as the target object, sphere or ellipsoid which has plenty of local geometry samples are sufficient to build up a look-up table, as this method solves the problem locally. Gradient domain methods are introduced to finally generate visual-pleasing results.

The co-occurrence statistics between features across a pair of images are learned from a training set comprising matched and mismatched image pairs - these are expressed in the form of a cross-feature ratio table. The proposed method does not require feature-to-feature correspondences, but instead identifies and exploits feature co-occurrences that are able to provide discriminative result from the transformation. The method not only allows for the matching of test image pairs that have substantially different visual content as compared to those present in the training set, but also caters for transformations and relations that do not preserve image structure."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2082190", "authors": ["Tat-Jen Cham", "Jianfei Cai", "Chitra Dorai", "Deepu Rajan", "Tat-Seng Chua"], "publication_date": "2007/1/9", "publisher": "Springer-Verlag", "description": "Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Multimedia Modeling - Volume Part I | \nGuide Proceedings ACM Digital Library home ACM home Google, Inc.

When the mobile phone is detected as being lost or misused, the application takes steps to mitigate the impact of loss and to gather evidence. The goal is to aid in the recovery of the mobile phone. The prototype works regardless of the cellular infrastructure the mobile phone is operating in and makes minimum demands on the owner of the mobile phone.

This research project is aimed at developing technologies for cre- ating display walls easily with inexpensive portable equipment, and dramatically enhancing these display walls by allowing users to naturally interact with the dis- plays as well as having the displays proactively adapt to users. These interactive display walls are implemented using multiple cost-effective video cameras and ultra-portable computer projectors, circumventing the need for special, expen- sive and cumbersome equipment. In this report, we document the achievements made during the course of the research project, and describe some of the ma- jor research and development work carried out. These include (i) a display wall based on casually-placed projectors, (ii) virtual persistent displays that are able to dynamically eliminate shadows cast by users blocking the projectors, and (iii) a framework for detecting and recognizing symbolic hand gestures.

It has been recently used in the imbalanced binary classification problem, where the probability of one class far outweighs that of the other. Classical bounds on the generalization error are not directly applicable to explain the ability to generalize of a binary classifier learned with an asymmetric error. Because in this context, there are different penalties associated with the false positive rate and the false negative rate respectively. In this paper, we present some margin-based bounds on an asymmetric error of a binary classifier based on its empirical asymmetric error. We focus our study on convex combinations of classifiers like classifiers learned from boosting and neural networks. Based on our bounds, it is suggested that machine learning methods that use an asymmetric error to learn should produce a classifier that has different margins for examples coming from different classes, rather than treating the margins equally like current methods do."}}
