To perform the distributed computation tasks efficiently, Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) was proposed to reduce communication costs and mitigate the straggler effects through the use of coding techniques. In this paper, we propose a double auction mechanism to allocate the resources of the edge servers to the vehicles in order to complete the CDC tasks. Specifically, the vehicles use the PolyDot codes to manage the tradeoff between communication costs and recovery threshold. Given the requirements of various vehicles, the double auction mechanism matches the edge servers with the required resources to the vehicles. Besides, the double auction mechanism also determines the prices that the vehicles need to pay for the resources of the edge servers. The double auction mechanism satisfies the properties of individual rationality, incentive compatibility and budget-balance."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=K2CHjf0AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=K2CHjf0AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC": {"external_link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201204854S/abstract", "authors": ["Jer Shyuan Ng", "Wei Yang Bryan Lim", "Sahil Garg", "Zehui Xiong", "Dusit Niyato", "Mohsen Guizani", "Cyril Leung"], "publication_date": "2020/12", "journal": "arXiv e-prints", "pages": "arXiv: 2012.04854", "description": "As the amount of data collected for crowdsensing applications increases rapidly due to improved sensing capabilities and the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the cloud server is no longer able to handle the large-scale datasets individually.

However, distributed computing faces critical issues related to communication load and straggler effects. In particular, computing nodes need to exchange intermediate results with each other in order to calculate the final result, and this significantly increases communication overheads. Furthermore, a distributed computing network may include straggling nodes that run intermittently slower. This results in a longer overall time needed to execute the computation tasks, thereby limiting the performance of distributed computing. To address these issues, coded distributed computing (CDC), ie, a combination of coding theoretic techniques and distributed computing, has been recently proposed as a promising solution.
