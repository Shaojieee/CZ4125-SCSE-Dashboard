He received the PhD degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2015 and Bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2010. He has research interests broadly in data management and data mining. Specifically, he works in (a) spatial data management with machine learning-based techniques, (b) spatial data mining in the urban domain (e.g., traffic and mobility), (c) graph data mining (namely dense subgraph mining and graphlet mining), and recently in (d) high-dimensional vector data management (e.g., approximate nearest neighbor search). His research has been recognized with the \"Best Research Award\" provided by ACM-Hong Kong, the \"Fulbright-RGC Research Award\" provided by Research Grant Council (Hong Kong), the \"PG Paper Contest Award\" provided by IEEE-HK, and the \"Overseas Research Award\" provided by HKUST.", "interests": "\u2022\tSpatial data management\u2022\tSpatial data mining\u2022\tGraph data mining\u2022\tVector data management", "grants": "Google PhD FellowshipLearn to Augment and Represent Spatial Urban DataLeveraging Machine Learning for Bipartite MatchingPre-Processing and Querying Big Trajectory Data with Reinforcement Learning", "articles": ["2.\tZhang, Liang*, Cheng Long~^. \"Road Network Representation Learning: A Dual Graph based Approach.\" ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (IF: 4.157) (2023).#", "3.\tWang, Kaixin*, Cheng Long~^, Darrell Joshua Ong, Jie Zhang, and Xue-Ming Yuan. \"Single-site Perishable Inventory Management under Uncertainties: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach.\" IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (IF: 8.9) (2023).##", "4.\tZou, Jie**, Aixin Sun, Cheng Long~^, Mohammad Aliannejadi, and Evangelos Kanoulas. \"Asking Clarifying Questions: To benefit or to disturb users in Web search?.\" Information Processing & Management (IF: 7.466) 60, no. 2 (2023): 103176.#", "5.\tWang, Yongjie, Ke Wang, Cheng Long, and Chunyan Miao. \"Summarizing User-Item Matrix By Group Utility Maximization.\" ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (IF: 4.157) 17, no. 6 (2023): 1-22.#", "6.\tDu, Xinqi, Hechang Chen, Bo Yang, Cheng Long, and Songwei Zhao. \"HRL4EC: Hierarchical reinforcement learning for multi-mode epidemic control.\" Information Sciences (IF: 8.233) 640 (2023): 119065.##", "7.\tZhang, Liang*, Cheng Long~^, and Gao Cong. \"Region Embedding with Intra and Inter-View Contrastive Learning.\" IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (IF: 8.9) (2022).##", "8.\tLiu, Qidong, Cheng Long, Jie Zhang, Mingliang Xu, and Dacheng Tao. \"Aspect-Aware Graph Attention Network for Heterogeneous Information Networks.\" IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (IF: 10.4), 2022.##", "9.\tWei, Victor Junqiu, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, Cheng Long, David Mount, and Hanan Samet. \"Proximity Queries on Terrain Surface.\" ACM Transactions on Database Systems (IF: 1.629) 47, no. 4 (2022): 1-59.#", "10.\tCheng, Ji, Da Yan, Wenwen Qu, Xiaotian Hao, Cheng Long, Wilfred Ng, and Xiaoling Wang. \"Mining Order-preserving Submatrices under Data Uncertainty: A Possible-world Approach and Efficient Approximation Methods.\" ACM Transactions on Database Systems (IF: 1.629) 47, no. 2 (2022): 1-57.#", "11.\tMo, Zijing, Christian D.
