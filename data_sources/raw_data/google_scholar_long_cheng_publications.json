One example of these queries is the collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) which is to find a set of objects in the database such that it covers a set of given keywords collectively and has the smallest cost. Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms have severe scalability problems and existing approximate algorithms, though scalable, cannot guarantee near-to-optimal solutions. In this paper, we study the CoSKQ problem and address the above issues. Firstly, we consider the CoSKQ problem using an existing cost measurement called the maximum sum cost. This problem is called MaxSum-CoSKQ and is known to be NP-hard. We observe that the maximum sum cost of a set of objects is dominated by at most three objects which we call the distance owners of the set.

One notable cohesive structure is -quasi-clique (QC), where each vertex connects at least a fraction  of the other vertices inside. Enumerating maximal -quasi-cliques (MQCs) of a graph has been widely studied. One common practice of finding all MQCs is to (1) find a set of QCs containing all MQCs and then (2) filter out non-maximal QCs. While quite a few algorithms have been developed (which are branch-and-bound algorithms) for finding a set of QCs that contains all MQCs, all focus on sharpening the pruning techniques and devote little effort to improving the branching part. As a result, they provide no guarantee on pruning branches and all have the worst-case time complexity of , where  suppresses the polynomials and  is the number of vertices in the graph. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding a set of QCs containing all MQCs but deviate from further sharpening the pruning techniques as existing methods do. We pay attention to both the pruning and branching parts and develop new pruning techniques and branching methods that would suit each other better towards pruning more branches both theoretically and practically.

In practice, the ST data generation is usually influenced by various latent factors tied to natural phenomena or human socioeconomic activities, impacting specific spatial areas selectively. However, existing ST prediction methods usually do not refine the impacts of different factors, but directly model the entangled impacts of multiple factors. This amplifies the modeling complexity of ST data and compromises model interpretability. To this end, we propose a multi-factor ST prediction task that predicts partial ST data evolution under different factors, and combines them for a final prediction. We make two contributions to this task: an effective theoretical solution and a portable instantiation framework. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical solution called decomposed prediction strategy and prove its effectiveness from the perspective of information entropy theory. On top of that, we instantiate a novel model-agnostic framework, named spatio-temporal graph decomposition learning (STGDL), for multi-factor ST prediction. The framework consists of two main components: an automatic graph decomposition module that decomposes the original graph structure inherent in ST data into subgraphs corresponding to different factors, and a decomposed learning network that learns the partial ST data on each subgraph separately and integrates them for the final prediction.

Most solutions compress support foreground (FG) features into prototypes, but lose some spatial details. Instead, others use cross attention to fuse query features with uncompressed support FG. Query FG is safely fused with support FG, however, query background (BG) cannot find matched BG features in support FG, yet it inevitably integrates dissimilar features. Besides, as both query FG and BG are combined with support FG, they get entangled, thereby leading to ineffective segmentation. To cope with these issues, we design a self-calibrated cross attention (SCCA) block. For efficient patch-based attention, query and support features are firstly split into patches. Then, we design a patch alignment module to align each query patch with its most similar support patch for better cross attention. Specifically, SCCA takes a query patch as Q, and groups the patches from the same query image and the aligned patches from the support image as K&V. In this way, the query BG features are fused with matched BG features (from query patches), and thus the aforementioned issues will be mitigated. Moreover, when calculating SCCA, we design a scaled-cosine mechanism to better utilize the support features for similarity calculation. Extensive experiments conducted on PASCAL-5^ i and COCO-20^ i demonstrate the superiority of our model, eg, the mIoU score under 5-shot setting on COCO-20^ i is 5.6%+ better than previous state-of-the-arts.
