Though multi-class classification is typically solved by combining several binary classifiers, recently, several multi-class methods that consider all classes at once have been proposed. However, these methods require resolving a much larger optimization problem and are applicable to small datasets. Three methods based on binary classifications: one-against-all (OAA), one-against-one (OAO), and directed acyclic graph (DAG), and two approaches for multi-class problem by solving one single optimization problem, are implemented to predict protein secondary structure.

In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice, HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues, and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues, wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally, de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon, showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide, shows that the colon, liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally, histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells.

This paper investigates the stability of sparse auto-regressive models of building GRN from gene expression data. Criteria for evaluating the stability of estimating GRN structure are proposed. Thereby, stability of multivariate vector autoregressive (MVAR) methods - ridge, lasso, and elastic-net - of building GRN were studied by simulating temporal gene expression datasets on scale-free topologies as well as on real data gathered over Hela cell-cycle. Effects of the number of time points on the stability of constructing GRN are investigated.

At least, the number of time points equal to the number of genes in the network are needed to achieve decent accuracy and stability of the networks.

Artificial neural networks consist of simple processing elements called neurons, which are connected by weights. The number of neurons and how they are connected to each other defines the architecture of a particular neural network. Part 1 of the book has nine chapters, demonstrating some of recent neural network architectures derived either to mimic aspects of human brain function or applied in some real world problems. Muresan provides a simple neural network model, based on spiking neurons that make use of shunting inhibition, which is capable of resisting small scale changes of stimulus. Hoshino and Zheng simulate a neural network of the auditory cortex to investigate neural basis for encoding and perception of vowel sounds.", "total_citations": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 8, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6091628/", "authors": ["Song Liu", "Piyushkumar A Mundra", "Jagath C Rajapakse"], "publication_date": "2011/8/30", "conference": "2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "pages": "6601-6604", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "The performance of automated analysis of cellular images is heavily influenced by the features that characterize cells or cell nuclei.

We propose and implement a network-based method that integrates such patient omics data into Patient Similarity Networks. Topological features derived from these networks were then used to predict relevant clinical features. As part of the 2017 CAMDA challenge, we have successfully applied this strategy to a neuroblastoma dataset, consisting of genomic and transcriptomic data. In particular, we observe that models built on our network-based approach perform at least as well as state of the art models. We furthermore explore the effectiveness of various topological features and observe, for instance, that redundant centrality metrics can be combined to build more powerful models.

Huge dimensionalities of neuroimaging data as well as omics data pose tremendous challenge for methods integrating multiple modalities. There are few existing solutions that can combine both multi-modal imaging and multi-omics datasets to derive neurological insights. We propose a deep neural network architecture that combines both structural and functional connectome data with multi-omics data for disease classification. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) are used to model functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data simultaneously to learn compact representations of the connectome. A separate set of GCNs are then used to model multi-omics datasets, expressed in the form of patient similarity networks, and combine them with latent representations of the connectome. An attention mechanism is used to fuse the GCN outputs, which provides insights on which omics data contributed most to the model's classification decision. We demonstrate our methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification by using datasets from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). PD has been shown to be associated with changes in the human connectome and it is also known to be influenced by genetic factors.

Validating time delays from knowledge bases is a challenge since the vast majority of biological databases do not record temporal information of gene regulations. Biological knowledge and facts on gene regulations are typically extracted from bio-literature with specialized methods that depend on the regulation task. In this paper, we mine evidences for time delays related to the transcriptional regulation of yeast from the PubMed abstracts. Since the vast majority of abstracts lack quantitative time information, we can only collect qualitative evidences of time delays. Specifically, the speed-up or delay in transcriptional regulation rate can provide evidences for time delays (shorter or longer) in GRN. Thus, we focus on deriving events related to rate changes in transcriptional regulation. A corpus of yeast regulation related abstracts was manually labeled with such events. In order to capture these events automatically, we create an ontology of sub-processes that are likely to result in transcription rate changes by combining textual patterns and biological knowledge. We also propose effective feature extraction methods based on the created ontology to identify the direct evidences with specific details of these events.

The variability in these surface patterns between individuals is caused by local differences in the rate of angular deformations of cerebral tissues during brain development. It has been reported that age effects of the human brain result in significant changes in the cortical volume (Courchesne et al., 2000). Moreover, the locations of individual convolutions on the brain surface depend on local changes in cortical structure, with sulci occurring in relation to boundaries between cortical architectonic fields. Additionally, the importance of visualizing medical images, especially in 3D, for clinical applications involving the brain, is immense (Linney and Alusi, 1998).

Factors that control transition from mild forms of disease such as dengue fever (DF) to more life-threatening forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are poorly understood. Consequently, there are no reliable methods currently available for early triage of DHF patients resulting in significant over-hospitalization. Methodology/Principal FindingsWe have systematically examined the proteome, cytokines and inflammatory markers in sera from 62 adult dengue patients (44 DF; 18 DHF) with primary DENV infection, at three different times of infection representing the early febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages. Using fluorescent bioplex assays, we measured 27 cytokines in these serum samples. Additionally, we used multiple mass spectrometry methods for iTRAQ-based comparative analysis of serum proteome as well as measurements of protein adducts- 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine as surrogate measures of free radical activity.

Particularly, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is probably the most important technique that noninvasively studies brain functions under numerous cognitive and behavioral tasks. Functional brain studies acquire a time series of brain scans while the subject is alternatively performing an experimental task and a baseline task (so that the input stimulus to the brain takes the form of an on-off box-car pattern). Brain regions of interest are then detected through measuring the oxygenation level variations in blood vessels near the neurons activated by the input stimulus, ie, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The detection of brain activation provides functional maps exhibiting which brain regions correspond to specific sensory or cognitive tasks. In fMRI experiments, the BOLD signal (or the hemodynamic response) changes resulted from neural activities follow the pattern of input stimulus, but are usually contaminated by high-level noises (Bandettini et al., 1993).

In this paper, a pruning algorithm of neural networks using impact factor regularization is described to train network without overfitting and to achieve a smallsized network. In order to achieve this goal, an automatic determination method of the regularization parameter and an extended Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm are developed as learning algorithms of neural networks. We tested the proposed method on four regression problems and the simulation results showed our algorithm is effective in regression."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC": {"external_link": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-09192-1.pdf", "authors": ["Matteo Comin Lukas K\u00e4ll", "Elena Marchiori Alioune Ngom", "Jagath Rajapakse"], "description": "In the post-genomic era, a holistic understanding of biological systems and processes, in all their complexity, is critical in comprehending nature\u2019s choreography of life.

In the presented method, if one faulty agent requests for help or agents are informed of fault in one of their teammates, they first decide if they are able to help or not. In the case that they are able to help and several help requests exist, helper agents specify a sequence of help actions through another distributed decision-making phase. The introduced fault clearing method is totally distributed in the sense that each helper agent makes its decisions by itself and no central or special agent exists in the system. In fact, the decision making process and the required information are designed such that the agents cooperate implicitly to prevent the system performance loss. The developed ideas are implemented in a simulated Distributed Control System. As it is shown, the proposed distributed fault-clearing method\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1501834/", "authors": ["KC Wiese", "A Hendriks", "A Desch\u00eanes", "B Ben Youssef", "KB Duan", "JC Rajapakse", "H Wang", "F Azuaje", "H Zheng", "PC Ojha", "S McClean", "C Graham", "ND Black", "JG Hughes", "C Shaw"], "description": "Presents the table of contents for this issue of the periodical."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C": {"external_link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15834889720132089071&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "authors": ["Lipo Wang", "Jagath C Rajapakse", "Kunihiko Fukushima", "Soo-Young Lee", "Xin Yao"], "description": "Whispered vocalizations are wide-spread across human cultures. We studied the perceptional evaluation of this universal display and addressed specially its role in mediating particular emotions. This was done by investigating how human subjects (n= 210; age: 22-30 years) judged different sets of auditory stimuli; ie different sentences presented in whispered or normally spoken language (control). In addition, we varied the quality of emotions encoded in the stimuli and tested also effects of signal transmission via telephone. Judgements were extracted from audiovisual recordings and from selfreport data collected after each trial. Data analyses revealed that the decoding of emotions was almost equally good for whispered and spoken stimuli, and also not markedly impaired when filtered by a phone. Often, however, judgements were affected by social prejudice which could result in bimodal distributions of ratings\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC": {"external_link": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/api/v1/periodical/trans/tb/2005/03/n0271/13rRUIM2VFu/download-article/pdf", "authors": ["Jagath C Rajapakse", "Yan-Qing Zhang", "Gary B Fogel"], "description": "EXAMPLE: Application of biologically and linguistically inspired computational paradigms such as neural networks, evolutionary computation, and fuzzy systems and their hybridizations to problems in computational biology and bioinformatics have increased in recent years.

Most techniques perform the detection of activation in spatial and tempor al domains separately. Simultaneous analysis is ideal for analyzing the fMRI images as they account for the information distributed between both domains. Such simultaneous analysis of fMRI is referred to as spatiotemporal analysis. Benali et. al.[1] have introduced a spatiotemporal technique using the fixed effect model as an extension to principal component analysis (PCA). Distinguishing feature in this technique is the ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal domain prior knowledge into the modeling approach by incorporating into the covariance structure. However, this technique is only applicable to input stimulus having equal durations of ON and OFF states (symmetric experiments). Our present studies extend this technique to be able to detect activation in non-symmetric experiments."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9WPWHiEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=9WPWHiEAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4771826/", "authors": ["E Mossel", "S Roch", "M Steel", "J Ma", "MN Nguyen", "JC Rajapakse", "R Maitra", "S Narasimhan", "R Rengaswamy", "R Vadigepalli"], "description": "Provides instructions and guidelines to prospective authors who wish to submit manuscripts."}}
