In recent years, she has received over S$250M in large-scale research grants and initiated over S$200M worth of educational programmes for the EDB-Industrial Postgraduate Programme (IPP) PhD training over 5 years.Dr Miao is the Founding Director and Lead PI of the Joint NTU-UBC Research Centre of Excellence in Active Living for the Elderly (LILY), the first AI-empowered interdisciplinary ageing research centre in Singapore. In collaboration with NHG and TTSH, LILY\u2019s AI for ageing technologies have reached over 10,000 senior citizens in Singapore. LILY technologies have also been showcased during Singapore President\u2019s state visits and ministerial mission trips to UK, China and Japan.Dr Miao is the Founding Director and Lead PI of the S$50M Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute, Alibaba\u2019s first and largest joint research institute outside China. She is also the Founding Director and Lead PI of the $60M NTU-WeBank Joint Research Centre on FinTech. Dr Miao has served as Council Member, Singapore Computer Society (SCS) since 2006. She is Chair of the AI Body of Knowledge Review Panel which has played an instrumental role in positioning Singapore as a world leader in AI Ethics and Governance. She has served as Editor of several international journals and as Chair/Co-chair/Technical Program Committee member of many leading AI international conferences. She was the general chair of KDD 2021, the world\u2019s premier DSAI conference.Dr Miao received her PhD Degree in Computer Engineering from NTU and pursued her postdoctoral studies at Simon Fraser University (SFU), Canada. She was a founding faculty member and Associate Professor at the Centre for Digital Media, jointly established by UBC and SFU. She was also a Tan Chin Tuan Fellow for academic and research collaboration in AI for education at Harvard University and MIT. She is a Fellow of SCS, the Academy of Engineering Singapore (SAEng) and the Institution of Engineers Singapore (IES).", "interests": "Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), Human AI Interaction, AI Ethics, HAI for health, ageing, sustainability and education.", "grants": "AI for Person Re-Identification \u201cSkeleton-Based Person Re-Identification, Self-Supervised/Unsupervised Person Re-Identification, Domain Generalized Person Re-Identification\u201dAlibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research InstituteCyber Research Programme Office (CRPO)Joint NTU-Alibaba Research InstituteJoint NTU-WeBank Research Centre on FintechJoint SDU-NTU Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research(C-FAIR) - Smart Community Research and Talent ProgrammeMonetary Academic Resources for ResearchSenior-friendly Persuasive AI Companions for an Aging PopulationTradeMaster: Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading ToolkitTradeMaster: Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading Toolkit (SMU)TrustFUL: Trustworthy Federated Ubiquitous LearningTrustFUL: Trustworthy Federated Ubiquitous Learning (SCSE)WeBank-NTU Joint Research Institute on Fintech", "articles": ["Lim, W.
