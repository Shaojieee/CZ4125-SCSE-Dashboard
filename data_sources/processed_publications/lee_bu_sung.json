Users are using Twitter to report real-life events. This paper focuses on detecting those events by analyzing the text stream in Twitter. Although event detection has long been a research topic, the characteristics of Twitter make it a non-trivial task. Tweets reporting such events are usually overwhelmed by high flood of meaningless \u201cbabbles\u201d. Moreover, event detection algorithm needs to be scalable given the sheer amount of tweets. This paper attempts to tackle these challenges with EDCoW (Event Detection with Clustering of Wavelet-based Signals). EDCoW builds signals for individual words by applying wavelet analysis on the frequencybased raw signals of the words. It then filters away the trivial words by looking at their corresponding signal autocorrelations. The remaining words are then clustered to form events with a modularity-based graph partitioning technique. Experimental results show promising result of EDCoW.", "publication_year": 2011, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [4, 50, 88, 93, 121, 150, 130, 126, 86, 82, 50, 54, 18, 0]}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "title": "Optimization of resource provisioning cost in cloud computing", "authors": ["Sivadon Chaisiri", "Bu-Sung Lee", "Dusit Niyato"], "description": "In cloud computing, cloud providers can offer cloud consumers two provisioning plans for computing resources, namely reservation and on-demand plans. In general, cost of utilizing computing resources provisioned by reservation plan is cheaper than that provisioned by on-demand plan, since cloud consumer has to pay to provider in advance. With the reservation plan, the consumer can reduce the total resource provisioning cost. However, the best advance reservation of resources is difficult to be achieved due to uncertainty of consumer's future demand and providers' resource prices. To address this problem, an optimal cloud resource provisioning (OCRP) algorithm is proposed by formulating a stochastic programming model.

Recent evidence has shown that small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), mediators of posttranscriptional gene knockdown, can act as effective antiviral agents. Thus, the authors attempted to develop a novel siRNA-based anti-AHC agent effective against both EV70 and CVA24.Methods.: Concurrent screening of the entire viral genome sequences of EV70 and CVA24 using the CAPSID program identified five different siRNA candidates complementary to genome regions of both viruses. The antiviral potentials of these siRNAs were assessed by treating MRC5 and primary human conjunctival cells with the siRNAs and following this with viral challenge.Results.: Among the five siRNAs, AHCe-3D-3 siRNA showed excellent cytoprotective effects and dramatic decreases in virus replication and virus protein synthesis. This siRNA, targeting the virus polymerase 3D gene, also induced similar antiviral effects in primary human conjunctival cells.Conclusions.: These findings strongly suggest that the AHCe-3D-3 siRNA, homologous to two different AHC-associated enteroviruses, can provide equivalent antiviral activities against both AHC-causing enteroviruses.

The product is used in xenobiotic glucuronidation in hepatocytes and in the production of proteoglycans that are involved in promoting normal cellular growth and migration. Overproduction of proteoglycans has been implicated in the progression of certain epithelial cancers, while inhibition of UGDH diminished tumor angiogenesis in vivo. A better understanding of the conformational changes occurring during the UGDH reaction cycle will pave the way for inhibitor design and potential cancer therapeutics. Methodology Previously, the substrate-bound of UGDH was determined to be a symmetrical hexamer and this regular symmetry is disrupted on binding the inhibitor, UDP-\u03b1-D-xylose. Here, we have solved an alternate crystal structure of human UGDH (hUGDH) in complex with UDP-glucose at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. Surprisingly, the quaternary structure of this substrate-bound protein complex consists of the open homohexamer that was previously observed for inhibitor-bound hUGDH, indicating that this conformation is relevant for deciphering elements of the normal reaction cycle. Conclusion In all subunits of the present open structure, Thr131 has translocated into the active site occupying the volume vacated by the absent active water and partially disordered NAD+ molecule. This conformation suggests a mechanism by which the enzyme may exchange NADH for NAD+ and repolarize the catalytic water bound to Asp280 while protecting the reaction\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2011, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0]}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "title": "An IPv6 translation scheme for small and medium scale deployment", "authors": ["Yang Xia", "Bu Sung Lee", "Chai Kiat Yeo", "Vincent Lim Sok Seng"], "description": "With the fast growth of Internet, IPv4 address exhaustion is an imminent problem.

We consider a mapping task involving several million reads to a reference genome, and observe that the cloud-enabled sequence alignment can lead to many-fold speedup and scales up as the number of nodes increases. It was noted that the performance of sequence alignment algorithms depended upon the configuration of the cluster in which it is executed.

Methods: We investigated the motor performance of 9 dyskinetic and 10 non-dyskinetic PD subjects on and off l-DOPA, and of 10 age-matched control subjects, during a large-amplitude, overlearned, visually guided tracking task. Ambiguous visual feedback was introduced by adding \u201cjitter\u201d to a moving target that followed a Lissajous pattern. Root mean square (RMS) tracking error was calculated, and ANOVA, robust multivariate linear regression, and linear dynamical system analyses were used to determine the contribution of speed and ambiguity to tracking performance. Results: Increasing target ambiguity and speed contributed significantly more to the RMS error of dyskinetic subjects off medication. l-DOPA improved the RMS tracking performance of both PD groups.

These schemes mainly focus on providing seamless mobility by reducing the handover delay. They work well when the handover takes place between two overlapping wireless networks. However, in some worst scenario, it is possible that a mobile node (MN) becomes disconnected from the network for some time before it can join another wireless network. In such case, existing mobility protocols will suffer great data loss and the data connection could break. The inability to preserve data connection across long handover delay or connectivity disruption is an unavoidable obstacle before a convergent terminal mobility can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a disruption tolerant mobility architecture (DTMA) to address this issue. In DTMA, terminal mobility is supported via the use of local proxy server.

Efficient processing for Big Data analysis poses new challenges for almost all aspects of state-of-the-art data processing and management systems.

Current infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) clouds allow tenants to acquire and release resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs) on a pay-as-you-use basis. Most IaaS cloud providers such as Amazon EC2 offer a number of VM types (such as small, medium, large, and extra-large) with fixed amount of CPU, main memory, and disk. Tenants can only purchase fixed-size VMs and increase/decrease the number of VMs when the resource demands change. This is known as T-shirt and scale-out model [1].

In this paper we develop a layer-2 load balancing framework with a multi-path forwarding mechanism which balances the load across the network, thereby reducing the occurrence of congestion that leads to efficient utilization of the bi-section bandwidth in Data Centers. The proposed framework has several important features: 1) It provides adaptive multi path forwarding compatibility in layer-2 Ethernet switched networks to efficiently spread the load in adaption to changing load conditions. 2) It improves the bi-section bandwidth utilization in Data Center networks. 3) It is capable of achieving load balancing at the layer-2 level and 4) It ensures effective traffic redistribution upon link failures.

An optimal strategy for NZBC coding is then derived and experimental results are given for a comparison of the new scheme with uniform bit allocation.Introduction: The FGS video coding technique [1] has been proposed as a new flexible and simple framework for scalable coding, whose major difference from conventional SNR scalability is the adoption of BP coding for discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients instead of the conventional quantization of DCT coefficients. When we deliver the FGS-coded bitstreams through a bandwidth-constrained environment, there is a need to regulate the bitstream and accordingly perform an efficient bit allocation. Recent methods [2, 3] on bit allocation for FGS coding either employ the classical RD model used in general transform coders to express the coding behaviors of FGS layer approximately, or extract the RD relationship from experimental video data; but do not give an analytic RD model that combines the characteristics of FGS coding. In this letter, we will propose a new bit allocation scheme for FGS coding after analyzing the relationship of RD behaviors with respect to NZBC. We observe that there is a linear relationship between the output rate and the percentage of encoded NZBC in each BP, and the distortion (D) is directly determined by the coded NZBC.

However, existing methods cannot quantify the uncertainty of the predictions, limiting their interpretability and thus their use for practical applications in urban infrastructure planning. To that end, we propose a Bayesian deep-learning approach that formulates deep neural networks as Gaussian processes and integrates automatic variable selection.

Here, we used field observations and lab experiments to test the prey capture function of the marginal spikes on snap traps of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). Our field and laboratory results suggested surprisingly inefficient capture success: fewer than 1 in 4 prey encounters led to prey capture. Removing the marginal spikes decreased the rate of prey capture success for moderate-sized cricket prey by 90%, but this effect disappeared for larger prey. The nonlinear benefit of spikes suggests that they provide a better cage for capturing more abundant insects of moderate and small sizes, but may also provide a foothold for rare large prey to escape. Our observations support Darwin\u2019s hypothesis that the marginal spikes form a \u2018horrid prison\u2019 that increases prey capture success for moderate-sized prey, but the decreasing benefit for larger prey is unexpected and previously undocumented.

HPAM-D constructs data distribution trees based on two performance metrics, namely, latency to source and loss rate experienced by the clients. The protocol is evaluated against the latency based single-metric HPAM and a modified HPAM-L which aims only to optimize loss rate regardless of the latency to source. HPAM-L acts as a control experiment in the evaluation. Another novel feature introduced in HPAM-D is the detection of likely local congestion via a heuristic based on the computation of a client's relative loss rate with respect to the data received by its parent as opposed to the commonly used absolute loss rate experienced by a client. Simulation results show that HPAM-D not only helps a client to reduce unnecessary parent switches thereby reducing protocol overheads but also\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2013, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=400&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:Kv9jytqXTosC", "title": "Excessive sensitivity to uncertain visual input in L-dopa induced dyskinesias in Parkinson\u2019s disease: further implications for cerebellar involvement", "authors": ["James Stevenson", "Chonho Lee", "Bu Sung Lee", "Pouria Talebifard", "Edna Boringot Ty", "Kristina Aseeva", "Meeko Oishi", "Martin McKeown"], "description": "When faced with visual uncertainty during motor performance, humans rely more on predictive forward models and proprioception and attribute lesser importance to the ambiguous visual feedback.

In this paper, we introduce a resource scheduling framework for admission control in a grid computing environment for this purpose. It is built on a reference pricing model and utility functions.

The incorporation of siRNAs dramatically decreased cell death in permissive HeLa cells in parallel with a reduction in viral replication. Three of four siRNAs had potent anti-CVB3 activity. The present study thus demonstrates that the antiviral effect is due to the downregulation of viral replication. In addition, an effective CVB3-specific siRNA had similar antiviral effects in other related enteroviruses possessing sequence homology in the targeted region. Because the CVB3-specific siRNA is effective against other enteroviruses, siRNAs have potential for a universal antienterovirus strategy.Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a major causative agent of many human diseases, such as meningioencephalitis and myocarditis (16\u201318, 20, 21). CVB3 is a member of the Picornaviridae family and consists of a positive single-stranded RNA genome coated with capsid proteins, including VP1-4 (Fig. 1A)(23). Previous studies by our group and others have implied that CVB3 infection causes productive virus replication, which results in cell death in both permissive and target cells (1, 2, 9), a process closely associated with CVB3-related human illness (6, 27, 28).

A user\u2019s demand is often changing over time, indicating that it is difficult to keep the high resource utilization all the time for cost efficiency. Resource sharing is a classical and effective approach for high resource utilization. In view of the heterogeneous resource demands of users\u2019 workloads, multi-resource allocation fairness is a must for resource sharing in such pay-as-you-use computing systems. However, we find that, existing multi-resource fair policies such as Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), implemented in currently popular resource management systems such as Apache YARN [4] and Mesos [23], are not suitable for the pay-as-you-use computing systems. We show that this is because of their memoryless characteristic that can cause the following problems in the pay-as-you-use computing systems: 1). users can get resource benefits by cheating; 2). users might not be able to get the total amount of resources that they are entitled to in terms of their resource contributions. In this paper, we propose a new policy called H-MRF, which generalizes DRF and Asset Fairness with the long-term notion. We show that it can address these problems and is suitable for pay-as-you-use computing systems. We have implemented it into YARN by developing a prototype called MRYARN. Finally, we evaluate H-MRF using both testbed and simulated experiments.

For single-level resource allocation, we propose a novel fair resource allocation mechanism called Long-Term Resource Fairness (LTRF) for such computing. For hierarchical resource allocation, we propose Hierarchical Long-Term Resource Fairness (H-LTRF) by extending LTRF. We show that both LTRF and H-LTRF can address these fairness problems of current resource allocation policy and are thus suitable for cloud computing.

However, the slot-based MapReduce system (eg, Hadoop MRv1) can suffer from poor performance due to its unoptimized resource allocation. To address it, this paper identifies and optimizes the resource allocation from three key aspects. First, due to the pre-configuration of distinct map slots and reduce slots which are not fungible, slots can be severely under-utilized. Because map slots might be fully utilized while reduce slots are empty, and vice-versa. We proposes an alternative technique called Dynamic Hadoop Slot Allocation by keeping the slot-based model. It relaxes the slot allocation constraint to allow slots to be reallocated to either map or reduce tasks depending on their needs. Second, the speculative execution can tackle the straggler problem, which has shown to improve the performance for a single job but at the expense of the cluster efficiency. In view of this, we propose Speculative Execution Performance Balancing to balance the performance tradeoff between a single job and a batch of jobs. Third, delay scheduling has shown to improve the data locality but at the cost of fairness. Alternatively, we propose a technique called Slot PreScheduling that can improve the data locality but with no impact on fairness. Finally, by combining these techniques together, we form a step-by-step slot allocation system called DynamicMR that can improve the performance of MapReduce workloads substantially.

Nevertheless, its performance is limited due to the burgeoning volume of scientific data, and parallelism is necessary and crucial to keep the computation time at acceptable levels. The intrinsically strong data dependency of dynamic programming makes it difficult and error-prone for the programmer to write a correct and efficient parallel program. Therefore this paper builds a runtime system named EasyPDP aiming at parallelizing dynamic programming algorithms on multi-core and multi-processor platforms. Under the concept of software reusability and complexity reduction of parallel programming, a DAG Data Driven Model is proposed, which supports those applications with a strong data interdependence relationship. Based on the model, EasyPDP runtime system is designed and implemented. It automatically handles thread creation, dynamic data task allocation and scheduling, data partitioning, and fault tolerance. Five frequently used DAG patterns from biological dynamic programming algorithms have been put into the DAG pattern library of EasyPDP, so that the programmer can choose to use any of them according to his/her specific application. Besides, an ideal computing distribution model is proposed to discuss the optimal values for the performance tuning arguments of EasyPDP.

The cost of the algorithm is also analyzed, and the performance of the algorithm is studied using a simulation.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TyytTfQAAAAJ&cstart=500&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TyytTfQAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "title": "TSCloud-2012 Organizing and Program Committees", "authors": ["Ryan KL Ko", "Markus Kirchberg", "Stephane Bressan", "Aloysius Cheang", "Liqun Chen", "Raymond Choo", "Debabrata Dash", "Elena Ferrari", "Terence Hung", "Yixin Jiang", "Kashif Kifayat", "Dirk Kuhlmann", "Bu Sung Lee", "Patrick PC Lee", "Sebastian Link", "John CS Lui", "Peter Martini", "Leonardo A Martucci", "Miranda Mowbray", "Valtteri Niemi", "Graeme Proudler", "Tomas Sander", "Thar Baker Shamsa", "Kian Lee Tan", "Joseph CM Teo", "Claire Vishik", "Guojun Wang", "Lena Wiese", "Peng Zhang", "Qing Zhang"], "description": "TSCloud Organizing and Program Committees Toggle navigation IEEE Computer Society \nDigital Library Jobs Tech News Resource Center Press Room Advertising About Us IEEE \nIEEE Computer Society IEEE Computer Society Digital Library My Subscriptions Magazines \nJournals Conference Proceedings Institutional Subscriptions IEEE IEEE Computer Society \nMore Jobs Tech News Resource Center Press Room Advertising About Us Cart All \nAdvanced Search Conference Cover Image Download 1.Home 2.Proceedings 3.trustcom \n2012 TSCloud Organizing and Program Committees 2012, pp. liii, DOI Bookmark: 10.1109/TrustCom.2012.316 \nKeywords Authors Abstract Provides a listing of current committee members.

This standard covers Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and Physical (PHY) layer of OSI (Open System Interconnection) model. Currently, the number of WLAN cards which support this standard is limited and on the other hand many users already have WLAN cards. We proposed a MAC-Independent service differentiation mechanism which is called Ad Hoc Qs. In this paper we compare the performance of IEEE 802.11 e and Ad Hoc Qs in service differentiation in wireless networks. The simulation results show that Ad Hoc Qs surpasses IEEE 802.11 e in some features: Firstly, Ad Hoc Qs is implemented just by software upgrade in contrast to IEEE 802.11 e which needs hardware upgrade. Secondly, By increasing the amount of high priority traffics, the low priority traffics will suffer from\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}]
