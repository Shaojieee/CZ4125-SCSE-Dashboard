We propose as an alternative a new family of erasure codes called self-repairing codes (SRC) taking into account the peculiarities of distributed storage systems, specifically the maintenance process.

The responsibility ranges of the participating peers and navigability principles (greedy routing) heavily depend on the ring structure. For correctness guarantees, each node needs to eagerly maintain its immediate neighboring links-the ring invariant. However, the ring maintenance is an expensive task and it may not even be possible to maintain the ring invariant continuously under high churn, particularly as the network size grows. Furthermore, routing anomalies in the network, peers behind firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs) create non-transitivity effects, which inevitably lead to the violation of the ring invariant. We argue that reliance on the ring structure is a serious impediment for real life deployment and scalability of structured overlays. In this paper we propose an overlay called Fuzzynet, which does not rely on the ring invariant, yet have all the functionalities of structured overlays. Fuzzynet takes the idea of lazy overlay maintenance further by dropping any explicit connectivity and data maintenance requirement, relying merely on the actions performed when new Fuzzynet peers join the network.

However, unlike delta encoding techniques, DEC opportunistically exploits the sparsity (i.e., when the differences between two successive versions have few non-zero entries) in the updates to store the deltas using compressed sensing techniques applied with erasure coding. We first show that DEC provides significant savings in the storage size for versioned data whenever the update patterns are characterized by in-place alterations. Subsequently, we propose a practical DEC framework so as to reap storage size benefits against not just in-place alterations but also real-world update patterns such as insertions and deletions that alter the overall data sizes.

We devise a system that allows data owners to specify fine-grained policies associated with their data streams, then to encrypt the streams and relay them to the cloud for live processing and storage for future use. The access control policies are enforced by the cloud, without the latter learning about the data, while ensuring that unauthorized access is not feasible. To realize these ends, we employ a novel cryptographic primitive, namely proxy-based attribute-based encryption, which not only provides security but also allows the cloud to perform expensive computations on behalf of the users.

However, existing approaches are impaired by three critical concerns: illegal authorization, key disclosure, and privacy leakage. To address these, we propose a blockchain-based data governance system that employs blockchain technology and attribute-based encryption to prevent privacy leakage and credential misuse. First, our ABE encryption system can handle multi-authority use cases while protecting identity privacy and hiding access policy, which also protects data sharing against corrupt authorities. Second, applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption makes the whole system efficient and responsive to real-world conditions. Furthermore, the encrypted data is stored in a decentralized storage system such as IPFS, which does not rely on any centralized service provider and is, therefore, resilient against single-point failures.

Cross-chain services cannot violate transaction atomicity, and are disincentivized from other types of misbehavior -- i.e., causing delays or misrepresenting information -- through an audit system. BlockChain I/O uses stablecoins to mitigate price fluctuations, and a Digital ID system to allow users to prove aspects of their identity without violating privacy.

In this paper we present CloudMine, a cloud-based service which allows multiple data owners to perform privacy-preserved computation over the joint data using their clouds as delegates. CloudMine protects data privacy with respect to semi-honest data owners and semi-honest clouds. It furthermore ensures the privacy of the computation outputs from the curious clouds. It allows data owners to reliably detect if their cloud delegates have been lazy when carrying out the delegated computation. CloudMine can run as a centralized service on a single cloud, or as a distributed service over multiple, independent clouds. CloudMine supports a set of basic computations that can be used to construct a variety of highly complex, distributed privacy-preserving data analytics. We demonstrate how a simple instance of CloudMine (secure sum service) is used to implement three classical data mining tasks (classification, association rule mining and clustering) in a cloud environment.

A P2P network where numerous users come together to share resources like data content, bandwidth, storage space and CPU resources is an excellent platform for distributed classification. However, two important aspects of the learning environment have often been overlooked by other works, viz., 1) location of the peers which results in variable communication cost and 2) heterogeneity of the peers\u2019 data which can help reduce redundant communication. In this paper, we examine the properties of network and data heterogeneity and propose a simple yet efficient P2P classification approach that minimizes expensive interregion communication while achieving good generalization performance.

These challenges pose difficulties for deploying conventional machine learning techniques in P2P networks, which may be hard to achieve classification accuracies comparable to regular centralized solutions. We recently investigated the classification problem in P2P networks and proposed a novel P2P classification approach by cascading Reduced Support Vector Machines (RSVM). Although promising results were obtained, the existing solution has some drawback of redundancy in both communication and computation. In this paper, we present a new approach to over the limitation of the previous approach. The new method can effectively reduce the redundancy and thus significantly improve the efficiency of communication and computation, meanwhile it still maintains good classification accuracies comparable to both the centralized solution and the previously proposed P2P solution.

Traditional designs consider incremental or possibly even parallelized construction of a single overlay, which implicitly assumes global control and coordination to enforce the construction of an unique overlay. However, if merger of originally isolated overlays is made possible, then one can realize decentralized bootstrapping of overlays. So to say, smaller overlays can be constructed using any of the traditional mechanisms, which can then organically coalesce to form a larger overlay. Such a self-organizational attribute of decentralized bootstrapping is of paramount importance for large scale systems. In our previous works, we explained the challenges of merging important families of (tree and ring) structured overlays [6], and identified that tree structured overlays are relatively easier to merge in a transparent manner [5]. In this paper we investigate how two ring structured overlays can be merged, both in terms of the necessary algorithms, as well as how it performs during the merger process. We also introduce interesting new metrics to evaluate the merger process and carry out asymptotic analysis for estimating the same, besides conducting simulation experiments to validate the theory as well as measure other aspects of the overlays\u2019 performance.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=VWi3_OIAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=VWi3_OIAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "title": "Coalitional Auctions for Complex Projects: Centralized and Decentralized View", "authors": ["Piotr Skowron", "Krzysztof Rzadca", "Anwitaman Datta"], "description": "To successfully complete a complex project, be it a construction of an airport or of a backbone IT system, agents (companies or individuals) must form a team (a coalition) having required competences and resources.

In these models, we investigate rational strategies of the agents (what salary should they ask? with whom should they team up?) under different organizations of the market.
