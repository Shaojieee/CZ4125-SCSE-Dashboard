Many approaches address the issue of unlabelled datasets by tightly coupling machine learning algorithms with interactive visualisations. Using appropriate techniques, analysts can play an active role in a highly interactive and iterative machine learning process to label the dataset and create meaningful partitions. While this principle has been implemented either for unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised machine learning tasks, the combination of all three methodologies remains challenging. In this paper, a visual analytics approach is presented, combining a variety of machine learning capabilities with four linked visualisation views, all integrated within the mVis (multivariate Visualiser) system. The available palette of techniques allows an analyst to perform exploratory data analysis on a multivariate dataset and divide it into meaningful labelled partitions, from which a classifier can be built. In the workflow, the analyst can label interesting patterns or outliers in a semi-supervised process supported by active learning. Once a dataset has been interactively labelled, the analyst can continue the workflow with supervised machine learning to assess to what degree the subsequent classifier has effectively learned the concepts expressed in the labelled training dataset. Using a novel technique called automatic dimension selection, interactions the analyst had with dimensions of the multivariate dataset are used to steer the machine learning algorithms.

In the simulation phase, the cutting paths are detected on the collision triangles and then mapped to local 2D coordinates systems in which the intersections between visual mesh and the cutting paths are calculated.

For each mesh patch, four boundary condition curves are calculated via the parameterization for local PDE patch construction.

The model depends on a representative physical property of the alveolar region termed the effective diffusivity, a function of the diffusivity, solubility, morphology and interface topography of each alveolar constituent. Unfortunately, the direct determination of the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region is impractical because of the difficulty in describing the internal geometry of each alveolar constituent. However, the transient solution of the macroscopic model can be used in conjunction with the lung-diffusing capacity (measured in a clinical setting) to determine the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region. With the effective diffusivity known, the three-dimensional effects of red blood-cell distribution on the lung-diffusing capacity can be predicted via numerical simulations. The results, obtained for normal (random), uniform, center-cluster, cornercluster, and several chain-like distributions, reveal a strong relationship between the type of red-cell distribution and the lung-diffusing capacity. The model developed has been used in order to study the impact of microscopic particles whose presence in the alveolar region may affect the lung-diffusing capacity.

As a result, when teaching subjects richly infused with geometry and mathematics it is usually a challenge for the learners to follow the instructor and visualize how mathematical concepts reflect in 3D geometry and colors. We have proposed an approach that allows for defining geometry, visual appearance and tangible physical properties of virtual objects by using mathematical formulas. It allows the learners to get immersed within the 3D scene and explore the shapes which are being modeled visually and haptically. We illustrate this concept with our function-based extension of X3D and VRML.

We define geometry, appearance and density of the solid objects by implicit, explicit and parametric functions straight in the VRML/X3D code or in dynamic-link libraries.

Cyberworlds are information worlds formed on the web either intentionally or spontaneously, with or without visual design. As information worlds, they can be virtual or real, or both. In terms of information modeling, the theoretical ground for cyberworlds is far above the level of integrating spatial database models and temporal database models. In conjunction with web-based activities, cyberworlds have been leading the real world in finance, business, commerce, manufacturing and politics.

The increased complexity of many challenges in computational science demands the use of supercomputing, parallel processing, sophisticated algorithms, and advanced system software and architecture.
