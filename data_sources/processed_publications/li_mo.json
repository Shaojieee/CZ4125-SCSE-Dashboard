For the past decades, increasing efforts have been put into exploring an accurate, efficient, and inexpensive way to instantly monitor the urban traffic conditions. Conventional methods rely on intrusive sensing, where people deploy infrastructural devices like loop detectors or traffic cameras at roadsides to actively detect traffic references. Installing such intrusive devices incurs substantial deployment and maintenance costs and can only provide limited observation at sparse positions. Recent studies resort to the GPS traces collected from \"probe vehicles\" like taxis or private cars to estimate the road traffic conditions [2, 5].

The downlink transmission often suffers from its short range and vulnerability to interference, which limits the practical application and deployment of backscatter communication systems.

Passive DSSS is able to increase the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by using direct sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) techniques to suppress interference and noise. The key challenge lies in the demodulation of DSSS signals, where the conventional solutions require power-hungry computations to synchronize a locally generated spreading code with the received DSSS signal, which is infeasible on energy-constrained backscatter devices. Passive DSSS addresses such a challenge by shifting the generation and synchronization of the spreading code from the receiver to the gateway side, and therefore achieves ultra-low power DSSS demodulation. We prototype passive DSSS for proof of concept.

It is challenging, however, to perform route planning over a large number of students each having multiple potential pickup locations. We develop a graph-based data structure that embeds potential pickup locations of all students with the awareness of real-world constraints and existing public transits. Based on the graph structure, we prove that the optimal last-mile school shuttle planning problem is NP-hard and thereafter design a Tabu-based expansion algorithm to solve the problem, which strikes at a proper balance between the savings of students\u2019 commute time and the total cost of operating the shuttle buses. Extensive experiments with large-scale real-world crowdsensed trajectory data demonstrate that our last-mile school shuttles can save the traveling time for most students by over 20% and the savings can be up to 65% for 10% of the students.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}]
