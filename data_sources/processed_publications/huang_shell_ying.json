In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the technology of AGV systems and rapid progress has been witnessed. As one of the enabling technologies, scheduling and routing of AGVs have attracted considerable attention. Many algorithms for the scheduling and routing of AGVs have been proposed. However, most of the existing results are applicable to systems with a small number of AGVs, offering a low degree of concurrency. With a drastically increased number of AGVs in recent applications (e.g. in the order of a hundred in a container handling system), efficient algorithms are needed to resolve the increased contention of resources (e.g. path, loading and unloading buffers) among AGVs.

For human-like agents, the independent intentions should be scheduled based on their priorities, which show the respective importance and urgency of the intentions. We propose to enrich the BDI agent architecture with 2 processing components, a PCF (Priority Changing Function) Selector and a Priority Controller. These enable a BDI agent to assign an initial priority value to an intention and change it with time according to the chosen PCF. The initial priority value reflects its urgency at the time of intention creation. The PCF selected defines how the priority should change with time. As an example, we design a function by simulating human behaviors when dealing with several things at the same time. The priority first increases with time according to the Gaussian function to simulate that people are more inclined to do something which has been on their mind for sometime. After a certain time, if the intention still does not get executed because of other higher priority intentions, its priority will decrease according to the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.

Although goal generation results in an increase in the agent\u2019s knowledge about its goals, the overall autonomy of the agent does not increase as its goals are derived from its preferences (which are programmed). We argue that to achieve greater autonomy, an agent must be able to generate new preferences.

However, a change in the number of supersteps can also introduce load imbalances within supersteps into the simulation. This observation becomes apparent with the FET protocol in particular. The performance of the refined protocols is compared through several semiconductor supply-chain simulation models.

Introduction. Parallel discrete-event simulation (PDES) has been a well-researched area for many years. An important area in PDES has been the design and development of new synchronization protocols. In PDES, a simulation is decomposed into logical processes (LPs) that can be simulated in parallel. PDES synchronization protocols are used to ensure that parallel execution of these LPs does not violate the causality constraint, ie events are strictly processed in timestamp order. PDES synchronization protocols can be broadly classified into two categories, conservative and optimistic. Conservative protocols [7, 4] strictly enforce the causality constraint by allowing the simulation to progress up to a safetime. A safetime is a time guarantee that no events with a lower timestamp will be\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2002, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zWYCmiAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=zWYCmiAAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "title": "A Guide to Research in Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance Systems in Constraint Satisfaction", "authors": ["J Tay", "C Quek", "S Huang"], "description": "Publisher SummaryThe reason maintenance problem-solving architecture presents a new paradigm for organizing data and control.

These two cranes cannot cross each other and have to maintain safety distance at all times. Thus they may block each other in their storage and retrieval operations. This will severely lower their combined productivity unless careful planning of the crane operations is done. In this paper, we propose a real-time yard crane scheduling method for twin yard cranes when end-loading block layout is used. The method is executed every time a crane is about to complete its current operation. It selects its next job from a rolling planning window and schedules its operation time. The method adopts the non-zero-sum game approach to induce the cooperative behaviour of the two cranes. Two algorithms, the two-step lookahead algorithm and the three-step lookahead algorithm are presented. The objective is to minimize the average makespan of the two yard cranes. Our experiments to evaluate the algorithm performance showed that the both algorithms are effective and efficient. The three-step lookahead is more complex but produces better results.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zWYCmiAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=zWYCmiAAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "title": "A Randomized Heuristic Algorithm for Cyclic Routing of UAVs", "authors": ["Cheng Siang Lim", "Shell Ying Huang"], "description": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly used in military and civilian applications. Even though the UAV routing problems have similarities with Vehicle Routing Problems, there are still many problems where effective and efficient solutions are lacking. We propose a randomized heuristic algorithm for the cyclic routing of a single UAV. The UAV is required to visit a set of target areas where the time interval between consecutive visits to each area cannot exceed its relative deadline. The PSPACE-complete problem has a solution whose length may be exponential. Our algorithm tries to compute a feasible cyclic route while trying to keep short the cycle time. Our tests of 57 instances of the problem show that the algorithm has good effectiveness and efficiency.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zWYCmiAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=zWYCmiAAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "title": "Dynamic Utility of Preferences and Goal Adoption in Autonomous Intelligent Agents", "authors": ["Umair Rafique", "Shell Ying Huang"], "description": "An autonomous intelligent agent situated in an environment needs to know the preferred states of its environment it wants to achieve so that it can work towards achieving them. We refer to these preferred states as \u201cpreferences\u201d of the agent. The preferences an agent selects to achieve at a given time are called its \u201cgoals\u201d while this selection process is called \u201cgoal adoption\u201d. In essence goal adoption for an autonomous intelligent agent is about determining 1) which preference to adopt as a goal at a given time and 2) when to adopt a goal. The popular approach to goal adoption is to assign static utility values to preferences and then adopt the one with the highest utility as goal at a given time. However there are two problems with this approach. Firstly a preference can be useful to a varying degree depending upon the situation the agent is in. For example the preference to play your favorite game will be more attractive if you have not done so for a while compared to when you have just played it. Static utility value of a preference cannot represent its usefulness in such different situations. Secondly such an approach does not specify \u201cwhen\u201d an agent should adopt a goal. In this paper we propose an approach to goal adoption where we model preferences of an agent as the means to satisfy its motivations where a motivation represents the internal state of the agent with respect to a certain feeling. The satisfaction level of motivations of an agent is affected by changes in its situation and by its own activities. The collective state of an agent\u2019s motivations at a given time determines how satisfied the agent is at that time. We represent the utility of a\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}}]
