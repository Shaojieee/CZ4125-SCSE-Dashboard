Utilizing explainable AI techniques, the research revealed that city lockdowns, contact tracing, and wearing face masks were the most effective strategies. However, the study also found that mass testing alone did not yield significant results in curbing the spread of the virus.", "intermediate_results": {"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=N2O4KmIAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=N2O4KmIAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC": "The research article investigates the effectiveness of different measures implemented to combat COVID-19 in 18 countries and regions, using explainable AI techniques.
