In this paper, we start from a different perspective and propose a robust learning paradigm called JoCoR, which aims to reduce the diversity of two networks during training. Specifically, we first use two networks to make predictions on the same mini-batch data and calculate a joint loss with Co-Regularization for each training example. Then we select small-loss examples to update the parameters of both two networks simultaneously. Trained by the joint loss, these two networks would be more and more similar due to the effect of Co-Regularization. Extensive experimental results on corrupted data from benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M demonstrate that JoCoR is superior to many state-of-the-art approaches for learning with noisy labels.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC"}, {"title": "Provably consistent partial-label learning", "description": "Partial-label learning (PLL) is a multi-class classification problem, where each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels.

In this paper, we propose the first generation model of candidate label sets, and develop two PLL methods that are guaranteed to be provably consistent, ie, one is risk-consistent and the other is classifier-consistent. Our methods are advantageous, since they are compatible with any deep network or stochastic optimizer. Furthermore, thanks to the generation model, we would be able to answer the two questions above by testing if the generation model matches given candidate label sets.

Unfortunately, the problem setting only allows a single CL for each example, which notably limits its potential since our labelers may easily identify multiple CLs (MCLs) to one example. In this paper, we propose a novel problem setting to allow MCLs for each example and two ways for learning with MCLs. In the first way, we design two wrappers that decompose MCLs into many single CLs, so that we could use any method for learning with CLs. However, the supervision information that MCLs hold is conceptually diluted after decomposition. Thus, in the second way, we derive an unbiased risk estimator; minimizing it processes each set of MCLs as a whole and possesses an estimation error bound. We further improve the second way into minimizing properly chosen upper bounds. Experiments show that the former way works well for learning with MCLs but the latter is even better.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC"}, {"title": "Learning efficient multi-agent communication: An information bottleneck approach", "description": "We consider the problem of the limited-bandwidth communication for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents cooperate with the assistance of a communication protocol and a scheduler.

Meanwhile, an unnecessary communication connection should not be established because it occupies limited resources in vain. In this paper, we develop an Informative Multi-Agent Communication (IMAC) method to learn efficient communication protocols as well as scheduling. First, from the perspective of communication theory, we prove that the limited bandwidth constraint requires low-entropy messages throughout the transmission. Then inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we learn a valuable and compact communication protocol and a weight-based scheduler.

TMEs can capture many realistic scenarios, including: 1) a team of players play against a target player in poker games; and 2) defense resources schedule and patrol independently in security games. However, the study of efficiently finding TMEs within any given accuracy in EFGs is almost completely unexplored. To fill this gap, we first study the inefficiency caused by computing the equilibrium where team players correlate their strategies and then transforming it into the mixed strategy profile of the team and show that this inefficiency can be arbitrarily large. Second, to efficiently solve the non-convex program for finding TMEs directly, we develop the Associated Recursive Asynchronous Multiparametric Disaggregation Technique (ARAMDT) to approximate multilinear terms in the program with two novel techniques: 1) an asynchronous precision method to reduce the number of constraints and variables for approximation by using different precision levels to approximate these terms; and 2) an associated constraint method to reduce the feasible solution space of the mixed-integer linear program resulting from ARAMDT by exploiting the relation between these terms.

Existing algorithms are inefficient to compute TMEs in large games, especially when the strategy space is too large to be represented due to limited memory. In two-player games, the Incremental Strategy Generation (ISG) algorithm is an efficient approach to avoid enumerating all pure strategies.

There are security domains where the payoffs for preventing the different types of adversaries may take different forms (seized money, reduced crime, saved lives, etc) which are not readily comparable. Thus, it can be difficult to know how to weigh the different payoffs when deciding on a security strategy. To address the challenges of these domains, we propose a fundamentally different solution concept, multi-objective security games (MOSG), which combines security games and multiobjective optimization. Instead of a single optimal solution, MOSGs have a set of Pareto optimal (non-dominated) solutions referred to as the Pareto frontier. The Pareto frontier can be generated by solving a sequence of constrained single-objective optimization problems (CSOP), where one objective is selected to be maximized while lower bounds are specified for the other objectives. Our contributions include:(i) an algorithm, Iterative \u03f5-Constraints, for generating the sequence of CSOPs;(ii) an exact approach for solving an MILP formulation of a CSOP (which also applies to multi-objective optimization in more general Stackelberg games);(iii) heuristics that achieve speedup by exploiting the structure of security games to further constrain a CSOP;(iv) an approximate approach for solving an algorithmic formulation of a CSOP, increasing the scalability of our approach with quality guarantees.

The optimal reserve price depends on bidders' value distributions, which, however, are generally unknown to auctioneers. A common practice for auctioneers is to first collect information about the value distributions by a sampling procedure and then apply the reserve price estimated with the sampled bids to the following auctions. In order to maximize the total revenue over finite auctions, it is important for the auctioneer to find a proper sample size to trade off between the cost of the sampling procedure and the optimality of the estimated reserve price. We investigate the sample size optimization problem for Generalized Second Price auctions, which is the most widely-used mechanism in ad auctions, and make three main contributions along this line. First, we bound the revenue losses in the form of competitive ratio during and after sampling. Second, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal sample size as a non-convex mixed integer optimization problem. Then we characterize the properties of the problem and prove the uniqueness of the optimal sample size. Third, we relax the integer optimization problem to a continuous form and develop an efficient algorithm based on the properties to solve it.

Moreover, existing work in container inspection neglects the sophisticated behavior of the smuggler who can surveil the inspector\u2019s strategy and decide the optimal (sequential) smuggling plan. This paper is the first to tackle this challenging container inspection problem, where a novel Container Inspection Model (CIM) is proposed, which models the interaction between the inspector and the smuggler as a leader-follower Stackelberg game and formulates the smuggler\u2019s sequential decision behavior as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The special structure of the CIM results in a non-convex optimization problem, which cannot be addressed by existing approaches. We make several key contributions including: i) a linear relaxation approximation with guarantee of solution quality which reformulates the model as a bilinear optimization problem, ii) an algorithm inspired by the Multipleparametric Disaggregation Technique (MDT) to solve the reformulated bilinear optimization, and iii) a novel iterative algorithm to further improve the scalability.

Our analysis starts from scenarios where there is only one credential and then extends to more general scenarios with multiple credentials. For single-credential scenarios, we demonstrate that the optimal defense strategy can be found by solving a binary combinatorial optimization problem called PEDS. For multiple-credential scenarios, we formulate it as a bilevel optimization problem for finding the optimal defense strategy and then reduce it to a single level optimization problem called PEMS using complementary slackness conditions.

Moreover, a terrorist planner may strategically choose to arouse terrorists considering the security agency's monitoring strategy.

Notwithstanding the progress, issues still remain. Because of the widely complained disadvantages of limited battery capacity and long charging time, charging convenience has become a top concern that greatly hinders the adoption of EVs. Specialized EV charging station, which provides more than 10 times faster charging speed than domestic charging, is therefore a critical element for successful EV promotion. While most existing researches focus on optimizing spatial placement of charging stations, they are inflexible and inefficient against rapidly changing urban structure and traffic pattern. Therefore, this paper approaches the management of EV charging stations from the pricing perspective as a more flexible and adaptive complement to established charging station placement. In this paper, we build a realistic pricing model in consideration of residential travel pattern and EV drivers\u2019 self-interested charging behavior, traffic congestion, and operating expense of charging stations.

However, in real-world application, the users are not uniformly distributed (ie, different users may have different browsing history, recommended items, and user profiles.

In this paper, we show that these two processes are in fact intrinsically interrelated. Motivated by this observation, we make an attempt to simultaneously optimize pricing and dispatch strategies.

The novelty of proposed solution lies specifically in efficient chromosome-based game encoding and dedicated local improvement heuristics. In vast majority of test cases with known equilibrium profiles, the method leads to optimal solutions with high stability and approximately linear time scalability. Another advantage is an iteration-based construction of the system, which makes the approach essentially an anytime method.

However, given the large number of Internet links, the defender can only monitor a subset of the links simultaneously, whereas any link might be attacked. Therefore, it remains challenging to practically deploy detection methods.

As opposed to the weak Stackelberg equilibrium (WSE), the SSE assumes that the follower breaks ties in favor of the leader and this is widely acknowledged and justified by the assertion that the defender can often induce the attacker to choose a preferred action by making an infinitesimal adjustment to her strategy. Unfortunately, in security games with resource assignment constraints, the assertion might not be valid; it is possible that the defender cannot induce the desired outcome. As a result, many results claimed in the literature may be overly optimistic. To remedy, we first formally define the utility guarantee of a defender strategy and provide examples to show that the utility of SSE can be higher than its utility guarantee. Second, inspired by the analysis of leader\u2019s payoff by Von Stengel and Zamir (2004), we provide the solution concept called the inducible Stackelberg equilibrium (ISE), which owns the highest utility guarantee and always exists. Third, we show the conditions when ISE coincides with SSE and the fact that in general case, SSE can be extremely worse with respect to utility guarantee.

As a key finding, attacker manipulation normally leads to the defender learning a maximin strategy, which effectively renders the learning attempt meaningless as to compute a maximin strategy requires no additional information about the other player at all. We then apply a game-theoretic framework at a higher level to counteract such manipulation, in which the defender commits to a policy that specifies her strategy commitment according to the learned information.

Therefore, the leader, i.e., the manager of the company or the league, needs to provide bonuses to followers for efficient coordination, which we call expensive coordination. The main difficulties of expensive coordination are that i) the leader has to consider the long-term effect and predict the followers' behaviors when assigning bonuses and ii) the complex interactions between followers make the training process hard to converge, especially when the leader's policy changes with time. In this work, we address this problem through an event-based deep RL approach. Our main contributions are threefold.

In this paper, we propose ResAct which seeks a policy that is close to, but better than, the online-serving policy. In this way, we can collect sufficient data near the learned policy so that state-action values can be properly estimated, and there is no need to perform online exploration. ResAct optimizes the policy by first reconstructing the online behaviors and then improving it via a Residual Actor. To extract long-term information, ResAct utilizes two information-theoretical regularizers to confirm the expressiveness and conciseness of features.

Meanwhile, recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown their effectiveness in a variety of long-term goal optimization tasks. For this reason, RL is widely considered as a promising framework for optimizing long-term user engagement in recommendation. Despite being a promising approach, the application of RL heavily relies on well-designed rewards, but designing rewards related to long-term user engagement is quite difficult. To mitigate the problem, we propose a novel paradigm, Preference-based Recommender systems (PrefRec), which allows RL recommender systems to learn from preferences about users' historical behaviors rather than explicitly defined rewards. Such preferences are easily accessible through techniques such as crowdsourcing, as they do not require any expert knowledge. With PrefRec, we can fully exploit the advantages of RL in optimizing long-term goals, while avoiding complex reward engineering. PrefRec uses the preferences to automatically train a reward function in an end-to-end manner. The reward function is then used to generate learning signals to train the recommendation policy. Furthermore, we design an effective optimization method for PrefRec, which uses an additional value function, expectile regression and reward model pre-training to improve the performance.

Unfortunately, in spite of its success, ACL's applicability is restricted due to: (1) lack of a general student framework to deal with the varying number of agents across tasks and the sparse reward problem, and (2) the non-stationarity in the teacher's task due to the ever-changing student strategies.

Existing works on off-policy ranking (OPR) adopt a supervised training paradigm, which assumes that there are plenty of deployed policies and the labels of their performance are available. However, this assumption does not apply to most OPE scenarios because collecting such training data might be highly expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel OPR framework called SOCCER, where the existing OPE methods are modeled as workers in a crowdsourcing system. SOCCER can be trained in a self-supervised way as it does not require any ground-truth labels of policies. Moreover, in order to capture the relative discrepancies between policies, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture to learn effective pairwise policy representations. Experimental results show that SOCCER achieves significantly high accuracy in a variety of OPR tasks. Surprisingly, SOCCER even performs better than baselines trained in a supervised way using additional labeled data, which further demonstrates the superiority of SOCCER in OPR tasks.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "topics": "Information Retrieval, Machine Learning"}, {"title": "RPM: Generalizable Multi-Agent Policies for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "description": "Despite the recent advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the MARL agents easily overfit the training environment and perform poorly in evaluation scenarios where other agents behave differently. Obtaining generalizable policies for MARL agents is thus necessary but challenging mainly due to complex multi-agent interactions. In this work, we model the MARL problem with Markov Games and propose a simple yet effective method, called ranked policy memory (RPM), i.e., to maintain a look-up memory of policies to achieve good generalizability. The main idea of RPM is to train MARL policies via gathering massive multi-agent interaction data. In particular, we first rank each agent\u2019s policies by its training episode return, i.e., the episode return of each agent in the training environment; we then save the ranked policies in the memory; when an episode starts, each agent can randomly select a policy from the RPM as the behavior policy. Each agent uses the behavior policy to gather multi-agent interaction data for MARL training. This innovative self-play framework guarantees the diversity of multi-agent interaction in the training data. Experimental results on Melting Pot demonstrate that RPM enables MARL agents to interact with unseen agents in multi-agent generalization evaluation scenarios and complete given tasks.

In our approach, agents utilize a time-dependent negotiation strategy in which the reserve price of each negotiation issue is dynamically determined by 1) the likelihood that negotiation will not be successfully completed (conflict probability), 2) the expected agreement price of the issue, and 3) the expected number of final agreements.

The determination of which resources to reserve to accomplish a task need not be known a priori, because there exist multiple plans for accomplishing the same task and they may require access to different resources [3]. While these plans can be functionally equivalent, they may have different performance/cost tradeoffs and may use a variety of resources, both local and belonging to other sites. The negotiation schedule, ie, the order in which remote resources are negotiated, determines how quickly one plan can be selected and deployed; it also decides the utility for running the plan. This paper studies the problem of optimizing negotiation schedules in cooperative systems with multiple plans. We first provide a votingbased heuristic that reduces the complexity O (n!) of the exhaustive search to O (mnq). We also present a weight-based heuristic that further reduces the complexity to O (mn). Experimental results show that, on average, 1) the voting-based approach achieved 6% higher utility than the weight-based approach but the voting-based approach has a much higher computation cost than the weightbased approach, 2) the two proposed approaches achieved almost 50% higher utility than a randomized approach; and 3) the average utility produced by the two proposed approaches are within almost 90% of that of the optimal results with reasonable plan sizes.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC"}], "2023": [{"title": "Reinforcement learning for quantitative trading", "description": "Quantitative trading (QT), which refers to the usage of mathematical models and data-driven techniques in analyzing the financial market, has been a popular topic in both academia and financial industry since 1970s.

Describing an agent's desired behaviors and properties can be difficult, even for experts. A new paradigm called reinforcement learning from human preferences (or preference-based RL) has emerged as a promising solution, in which reward functions are learned from human preference labels among behavior trajectories. However, existing methods for preference-based RL are limited by the need for accurate oracle preference labels. This paper addresses this limitation by developing a method for crowd-sourcing preference labels and learning from diverse human preferences. The key idea is to stabilize reward learning through regularization and correction in a latent space. To ensure temporal consistency, a strong constraint is imposed on the reward model that forces its latent space to be close to the prior distribution. Additionally, a confidence-based reward model ensembling method is designed to generate more stable and reliable predictions.

Cross Entropy (CE) loss has been shown to be not robust to noisy labels due to its unboundedness. To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design specialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to the underfitting issue. In this paper, our key idea is to induce a loss bound at the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustness of existing losses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the norm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In this manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded, mitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels. Moreover, we present theoretical analyses to certify the noise-tolerant ability of LogitClip. Extensive experiments show that LogitClip not only significantly improves the noise robustness of CE loss, but also broadly enhances the generalization performance of popular robust losses.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC"}, {"title": "Consistent Complementary-Label Learning via Order-Preserving Losses", "description": "In contrast to ordinary supervised classification tasks that require massive data with high-quality labels, complementary-label learning (CLL) deals with the weakly-supervised learning scenario where each instance is equipped with a complementary label, which specifies a class the instance does not belong to.

In this paper, we aim to propose overfitting-resistant and theoretically grounded methods for CLL.

Many works propose to abstract teammate instances into high-level representation of types and then pre-train the best response for each type. However, most of them do not consider the distribution of teammate instances within a type. This could expose the agent to the hidden risk of \\emph{type confounding}. In the worst case, the best response for an abstract teammate type could be the worst response for all specific instances of that type. This work addresses the issue from the lens of causal inference. We first theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the spurious correlation brought by uncontrolled teammate distribution. Then, we propose our solution, CTCAT, which disentangles such correlation through an instance-wise teammate feedback rectification. This operation reweights the interaction of teammate instances within a shared type to reduce the influence of type confounding. The effect of CTCAT is evaluated in multiple domains, including classic ad hoc teamwork tasks and real-world scenarios.

To solve this problem, we first propose a simple baseline method that takes the average loss incurred by candidate labels as the predictive loss. The drawback of this method lies in that the loss incurred by the true label may be overwhelmed by other false labels. To overcome this drawback, we propose an identification method that takes the least loss incurred by candidate labels as the predictive loss. We further improve it by proposing a progressive identification method to differentiate candidate labels using progressively updated weights for incurred losses.

A majority of current methods address such issue by training context encoders to identify environment parameters. Data with dynamics shift are separated according to their environment parameters to train the corresponding policy. However, these methods can be sample inefficient as data are used \\textit{ad hoc}, and policies trained for one dynamics cannot benefit from data collected in all other environments with different dynamics. In this paper, we find that in many environments with similar structures and different dynamics, optimal policies have similar stationary state distributions. We exploit such property and learn the stationary state distribution from data with dynamics shift for efficient data reuse. Such distribution is used to regularize the policy trained in a new environment, leading to the SRPO (\\textbf{S}tate \\textbf{R}egularized \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization) algorithm. To conduct theoretical analyses, the intuition of similar environment structures is characterized by the notion of homomorphous MDPs.

To this end, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent games with different population sizes. However, either deriving the closed-form solution for each game is theoretically intractable, training a distinct policy for each game is computationally intensive, or directly applying the policy trained in a game to other games is sub-optimal. We address these challenges through the Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO). Our contributions are three-fold. First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games with different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural options (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better performance. PAPO consists of three components: i) the population-size encoding which transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent encoding to avoid training collapse, ii) a hypernetwork to generate a distinct policy for each game conditioned on the population size, and iii) the population size as an additional input to the generated policy. Next, we construct a multi-task-based training procedure to efficiently train the neural networks of PAPO by sampling data from multiple games with different population sizes.

However, common MARL algorithms still suffer from scalability and sparse reward issues. One promising approach to resolving them is automatic curriculum learning (ACL). ACL involves a student (curriculum learner) training on tasks of increasing difficulty controlled by a teacher (curriculum generator). Despite its success, ACL's applicability is limited by (1) the lack of a general student framework for dealing with the varying number of agents across tasks and the sparse reward problem, and (2) the non-stationarity of the teacher's task due to ever-changing student strategies. As a remedy for ACL, we introduce a novel automatic curriculum learning framework, Skilled Population Curriculum (SPC), which adapts curriculum learning to multi-agent coordination. Specifically, we endow the student with population-invariant communication and a hierarchical skill set, allowing it to learn cooperation and behavior skills from distinct tasks with varying numbers of agents. In addition, we model the teacher as a contextual bandit conditioned by student policies, enabling a team of agents to change its size while still retaining previously acquired skills.

Many recent works consider the last-iterate convergence no-regret algorithms. Among them, the two most famous algorithms are Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) and Optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update (OMWU). However, OGDA has high per-iteration complexity. OMWU exhibits a lower per-iteration complexity but poorer empirical performance, and its convergence holds only when NE is unique. Recent works propose a Reward Transformation (RT) framework for MWU, which removes the uniqueness condition and achieves competitive performance with OMWU. Unfortunately, RT-based algorithms perform worse than OGDA under the same number of iterations, and their convergence guarantee is based on the continuous-time feedback assumption, which does not hold in most scenarios. To address these issues, we provide a closer analysis of the RT framework, which holds for both continuous and discrete-time feedback. We demonstrate that the essence of the RT framework is to transform the problem of learning NE in the original game into a series of strongly convex-concave optimization problems (SCCPs). We show that the bottleneck of RT-based algorithms is the speed of solving SCCPs. To improve the their empirical performance, we design a novel transformation method to enable the SCCPs can be solved by Regret Matching+ (RM+), a no-regret algorithm with better empirical performance, resulting in Reward Transformation RM+ (RTRM+).

With strong capabilities in sequential decision-making, Reinforcement Learning (RL) technology has achieved remarkable success in quantitative trading. Nonetheless, most existing RL-based MM methods focus on optimizing single-price level strategies which fail at frequent order cancellations and loss of queue priority. Strategies involving multiple price levels align better with actual trading scenarios. However, given the complexity that multi-price level strategies involves a comprehensive trading action space, the challenge of effectively training profitable RL agents for MM persists. Inspired by the efficient workflow of professional human market makers, we propose Imitative Market Maker (IMM), a novel RL framework leveraging both knowledge from suboptimal signal-based experts and direct policy interactions to develop multi-price level MM strategies efficiently. The framework start with introducing effective state and action representations adept at encoding information about multi-price level orders. Furthermore, IMM integrates a representation learning unit capable of capturing both short- and long-term market trends to mitigate adverse selection risk. Subsequently, IMM formulates an expert strategy based on signals and trains the agent through the integration of RL and imitation learning techniques, leading to efficient learning.

Due to the trade-off nature of trading computation time for solution quality, Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) methods have shown great success in online planning. However, the exponential growth of global joint-action space makes it challenging to apply MCTS to online multiagent planning (MAP). Our goal in this paper is to design an efficient and scalable coordinated MCTS method for online MAP. Combining with coordination graphs, recent Factored Value MCTS (FV-MCTS) has attempted to recover the trade-off property for MCTS-based online MAP. However, FV-MCTS directly uses the global payoff to reward each agent, and has difficulty in finding coordination actions in multiagent MCTS settings where other agents are also taking exploratory actions. We overcome this limitation by designing a generalized structural credit assignment (SCA)-guided coordinated MCTS, where SCA is used to promote coordination and MCTS is used to search promising global joint-actions. Specially, we use the Shapley value to provide a fair SCA, which can be efficiently computed by exploiting locality of interaction between agents. Moreover, theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method can bound the bias of the estimated value of the global join-action under certain conditions.

However, previous works rarely consider the uncertainty when humans provide feedback, especially in cases that the optimal actions are not obvious to the trainers. For example, the reward of a sub-optimal action can be stochastic and sometimes exceeds that of the optimal action, which is common in games or real-world. Trainers are likely to provide positive feedback to sub-optimal actions, negative feedback to the optimal actions and even do not provide feedback in some confusing situations. Existing works, which utilize the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and treat the feedback model as hidden parameters, do not consider uncertainties in the learning environment and human feedback. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel feedback model that considers the uncertainty of human feedback. However, this incurs intractable calculus in the EM algorithm.

Thus, it can be difficult to know how to weigh the different payoffs when deciding on a security strategy. To address the challenges of these domains, we propose a fundamentally different solution concept, multi-objective security games (MOSG), which combines security games and multiobjective optimization. Instead of a single optimal solution, MOSGs have a set of Pareto optimal (non-dominated) solutions referred to as the Pareto frontier.

In this work, we propose a new latent representation model POI2Vec that is able to incorporate the geographical influence, which has been shown to be very important in modeling user mobility behavior.

In all of these challenges, we have limited security resources that prevent full security coverage at all times. Instead, limited security resources must be deployed intelligently, taking into account differences in priorities of targets requiring security coverage, the responses of adversaries to the security posture, and potential uncertainty over the types, capabilities, knowledge, and priorities of adversaries faced. Game theory is well suited to adversarial reasoning for security resource allocation and scheduling problems. Casting the problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game in consideration of uncertainties, we have developed new algorithms for efficiently solving such games to provide randomized patrolling or inspection strategies.

Better defense solutions could therefore be potentially achieved by placing resources in a space outside of actual targets (eg, between targets). To address this limitation, we propose a model called Security Game on a Plane (SGP) in which targets are distributed on a 2-dimensional plane, and security resources, to be allocated on the same plane, protect targets within a certain effective distance.

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic ETC (DyETC) scheme which adjusts tolls to traffic conditions in realtime. The DyETC problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), the solution of which is very challenging due to its 1) multi-dimensional state space, 2) multi-dimensional, continuous and bounded action space, and 3) time-dependent state and action values. Due to the complexity of the formulated MDP, existing methods cannot be applied to our problem. Therefore, we develop a novel algorithm, PG-beta, which makes three improvements to traditional policy gradient method by proposing 1) time-dependent value and policy functions, 2) Beta distribution policy function and 3) state abstraction.

Thus, existing pricing solutions might be far from optimal in realistic markets. This paper provides the first study of service providers' dynamic pricing in consideration of market competition and makes three key contributions along this line. First, we propose a comprehensive model that takes into account the dynamic demand and interaction among providers, and formulate the optimal pricing policy in the competitive market as an equilibrium.

To overcome this issue, inspired by the notion of inducibility and the pessimistic Stackelberg equilibrium [20, 21], this paper presents the inducible Stackelberg equilibrium (ISE), which is guaranteed to exist and avoids overoptimism as the outcome can always be induced with infinitesimal strategy deviation.

However, users have very significant differences in both their susceptibility to phishing attacks as well as their access to critical information and credentials that can cause damage. Recent work has considered setting personalized thresholds for individual users based on a Stackelberg game model. We consider two important extensions of the previous model. First, in our model user values can be substitutable, modeling cases where multiple users provide access to the same information or credential. Second, we consider attackers who make sequential attack plans based on the outcome of previous attacks. Our analysis starts from scenarios where there is only one credential and then extends to more general scenarios with multiple credentials.

Specialized EV charging station, which provides more than 10 times faster charging speed than domestic charging, is therefore a critical element for successful EV promotion. While most existing researches focus on optimizing spatial placement of charging stations, they are inflexible and inefficient against rapidly changing urban structure and traffic pattern.

A CSG consists of a set of attackers connected by a (communication or trust) network who can form coalitions as connected subgraphs of this network so as to attack a collection of targets. A defender in a CSG can delete a set of edges, incurring a cost for deleting each edge, with the goal of optimally limiting the attackers\u2019 ability to form effective coalitions (in terms of successfully attacking high value targets).

A key advance of the deployed version of PAWS is that it incorporates the complex terrain information and generates a strategy consisting of easy-to-follow routes. In this demonstration, we provide 1) a video introducing the PAWS system; 2) an interactive visualization of the patrol routes generated by PAWS in an example area with complex terrain; and 3) a machine-human competition in designing patrol strategy given complex terrain and animal distribution.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C"}, {"title": "Alternating-offers bargaining in one-to-many and many-to-many settings", "description": "Automating negotiations in markets where multiple buyers and sellers operate is a scientific challenge of extraordinary importance.

To date, such cooperative decision making among attackers has been ignored in the security games literature. To address the issue of cooperation among attackers, we introduce a novel coalitional security game (CSG) model.

Although most of the robust loss functions stem from Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE) loss, they fail to embody the intrinsic relationships between CCE and other loss functions. In this paper, we propose a general framework dubbed Taylor cross entropy loss to train deep models in the presence of label noise.

However, in real-world application, the users are not uniformly distributed (ie, different users may have different browsing history, recommended items, and user profiles.

The nonstationarity also leads to the data efficiency problem: policies need more data at non-stationary states to stabilize training. To address these issues, we propose a novel HRL method: Interactive Influence-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (I2HRL). First, inspired by agent modeling, we enable the interaction between the lowlevel and high-level policies, ie, the low-level policy sends its policy representation to the highlevel policy. The high-level policy makes decisions conditioned on the received low-level policy representation as well as the state of the environment.

However, most of incomplete algorithms for DCOPs are context-free, ie, agents make a decision purely based on the state of their neighbors, which makes them prone to get trapped in poor local convergence. On the other hand, context-based algorithms use tables to exactly store all the information (eg, costs, confidence bounds), which limits their scalability. This paper tackles the limitation by incorporating deep neural networks in solving DCOPs for the first time and presents a neural context-based sampling scheme built upon regret-matching. In the algorithm, each agent trains a neural network to approximate the regret related to its local problem under current context and performs sampling according to the estimated regret. Furthermore, to ensure exploration, we propose a regret rounding scheme that rounds small regret values to positive numbers.

The three most prominent contemporary online equilibrium finding algorithms are adapted to the context of OEF, creating three model-based variants: OEF-PSRO and OEF-CFR, which generalize the widely-used algorithms PSRO and Deep CFR to compute Nash equilibria (NEs), and OEF-JPSRO, which generalizes the JPSRO to calculate (Coarse) Correlated equilibria ((C)CEs). We also combine the behavior cloning policy with the model-based policy to further improve the performance and provide a theoretical guarantee of the solution quality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over offline RL algorithms and the importance of using model-based methods for OEF problems. We hope our work will contribute to advancing research in large-scale equilibrium finding.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "topics": "Offline Reinforcement Learning, Multiplayer-game Setting, Model-based Methods"}, {"title": "Online collective multiagent planning by offline policy reuse with applications to city-scale mobility-on-demand systems", "description": "The popularity of mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems boosts the need for online collective multiagent planning, where spatially distributed servicing agents are planned to meet dynamically arriving demands. For city-scale MoDs with a population of agents, it is necessary to find a balance between computation time (ie, realtime) and solution quality (ie, the number of demands served). Directly using an offline policy can guarantee real-time, but cannot be dynamically adjusted to real agent and demand distributions. On the other hand, search-based online planning methods are adaptive. However, they are computationally expensive and cannot scale up. In this paper, we propose a principled online multiagent planning method, which reuses and improves the offline policy in an anytime manner. We first model MoDs as a collective Markov Decision Process (C-MDP) where the history collective behavior of agents affects the joint reward. We propose a novel state value function to evaluate the policy, and a gradient ascent (GA) technique to improve the policy. We show that GA-based policy iteration (GA-PI) on local policy can converge. Finally, given real-time information, the offline policy is used as the default plan and GA-PI is used to improve it and generate an online plan.

In this paper, we focus on an alternative solution concept in zero-sum multiplayer extensive-form games called Team-Maxmin Equilibrium (TME). It is a Nash equilibrium that maximizes each team member\u2019s utility. As TME is unique in general, it avoids the equilibrium selection problem. However, it is still difficult (FNP-hard) to find a TME. Computing it can be formulated as a non-convex program, but existing algorithms are capable of solving this program for only very small games.

Second, we propose an efficient correlation-based algorithm to solve the non-convex program for TME in games not belonging to this class. The algorithm combines two special correlation plans based on Mc-Cormick envelopes for convex relaxation and von Stengel-Forges polytope for correlated equilibria.

However, common MARL algorithms still suffer from scalability and sparse reward issues. One promising approach to resolve them is automated curriculum learning (ACL), where a student (curriculum learner) train on tasks of increasing difficulty controlled by a teacher (curriculum generator). Unfortunately, in spite of its success, ACL's applicability is restricted due to: (1) lack of a general student framework to deal with the varying number of agents across tasks and the sparse reward problem, and (2) the non-stationarity in the teacher's task due to the ever-changing student strategies. As a remedy for ACL, we introduce a novel automatic curriculum learning framework, Curriculum Oriented Skills and Tactics (COST), adapting curriculum learning to multi-agent coordination. To be specific, we endow the student with population-invariant communication and a hierarchical skill set. Thus, the student can learn cooperation and behavior skills from distinct tasks with a varying number of agents. In addition, we model the teacher as a contextual bandit conditioned by student policies. As a result, a team of agents can change its size while retaining previously acquired skills.

We prove that due to the representation limitation, LVF is only perfectly applicable to an extremely narrow class of tasks, which we define as the decomposable Markov game. Secondly, to handle the indecomposable Markov game where the LVF is inapplicable, we turn to value factorization with complete representation capability (CRC) and explore the general form of the value factorization function that satisfies both Independent Global Max (IGM) and CRC conditions. A common problem of these value factorization functions is the representation interference among true Q values with shared local Q value functions. As a result, the policy could be trapped in local optimums due to the representation interference on the optimal true Q values. Thirdly, to address the problem, we propose a novel value factorization method, namely Q Factorization with Representation Interference Suppression (QFRIS).

In traditional Stackelberg security game models the attacker knows only the probability that each target is covered by the defender, but is oblivious to the detailed timing of the coverage schedule. In many real-world situations, however, the attacker can observe the current location of the defender and can exploit this knowledge to reason about the defender\u2019s future moves. We show that this general modeling framework can be captured using adversarial patrolling games (APGs) in which the defender sequentially moves between targets, with moves constrained by a graph, while the attacker can observe the defender\u2019s current location and his (stochastic) policy concerning future moves. We offer a very general model of infinite-horizon discounted adversarial patrolling games. Our first contribution is to show that defender policies that condition only on the previous defense move (ie, Markov stationary policies) can be arbitrarily suboptimal for general APGs.

In Stage one, we introduce an efficient ensemble learning method, whose computational and memory costs are significantly lower comparing to traditional ensemble methods, to train multiple groups of trading experts with personalised market understanding and trading styles. In Stage two, we collect diversified investment suggestions through building a pool of trading experts utilizing hyperparameter level and initialization level diversity of neural networks for post hoc ensemble construction. In Stage three, we design three different mechanisms, namely as-needed router, with-replacement selection and integrated expert soup, to dynamically pick experts from the expert pool, which takes the responsibility of a portfolio manager.

Many works propose to abstract teammate instances into high-level representation of types and then pre-train the best response for each type. However, most of them do not consider the distribution of teammate instances within a type. This could expose the agent to the hidden risk of \\emph{type confounding}. In the worst case, the best response for an abstract teammate type could be the worst response for all specific instances of that type. This work addresses the issue from the lens of causal inference. We first theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the spurious correlation brought by uncontrolled teammate distribution. Then, we propose our solution, CTCAT, which disentangles such correlation through an instance-wise teammate feedback rectification. This operation reweights the interaction of teammate instances within a shared type to reduce the influence of type confounding. The effect of CTCAT is evaluated in multiple domains, including classic ad hoc teamwork tasks and real-world scenarios.

To this end, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent games with different population sizes.

We address these challenges through the Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO). Our contributions are three-fold. First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games with different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural options (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better performance. PAPO consists of three components: i) the population-size encoding which transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent encoding to avoid training collapse, ii) a hypernetwork to generate a distinct policy for each game conditioned on the population size, and iii) the population size as an additional input to the generated policy.

Empirical results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four real-world networks.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "topics": "Reinforcement Learning, Influence Maximization, Complex Contagion"}, {"title": "On the Importance of Feature Separability in Predicting Out-Of-Distribution Error", "description": "Estimating the generalization performance is practically challenging on out-of-distribution (OOD) data without ground truth labels. While previous methods emphasize the connection between distribution difference and OOD accuracy, we show that a large domain gap not necessarily leads to a low test accuracy. In this paper, we investigate this problem from the perspective of feature separability, and propose a dataset-level score based upon feature dispersion to estimate the test accuracy under distribution shift. Our method is inspired by desirable properties of features in representation learning: high inter-class dispersion and high intra-class compactness. Our analysis shows that inter-class dispersion is strongly correlated with the model accuracy, while intra-class compactness does not reflect the generalization performance on OOD data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both prediction performance and computational efficiency.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "topics": "Feature Separability, Predicting Out-Of-Distribution Error, Representation Learning"}, {"title": "PrefRec: Recommender Systems with Human Preferences for Reinforcing Long-term User Engagement", "description": "Current advances in recommender systems have been remarkably successful in optimizing immediate engagement. However, longterm user engagement, a more desirable performance metric, remains difficult to improve. Meanwhile, recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown their effectiveness in a variety of long-term goal optimization tasks. For this reason, RL is widely considered as a promising framework for optimizing long-term user engagement in recommendation. Though promising, the application of RL heavily relies on well-designed rewards, but designing rewards related to long-term user engagement is quite difficult. To mitigate the problem, we propose a novel paradigm, recommender systems with human preferences (or Preference-based Recommender systems), which allows RL recommender systems to learn from preferences about users\u2019 historical behaviors rather than explicitly defined rewards. Such preferences are easily accessible through techniques such as crowdsourcing, as they do not require any expert knowledge. With PrefRec, we can fully exploit the advantages of RL in optimizing long-term goals, while avoiding complex reward engineering. PrefRec uses the preferences to automatically train a reward function in an end-to-end manner. The reward function is then used to generate learning signals to train the recommendation policy. Furthermore, we design an effective optimization method for PrefRec, which uses an additional value function, expectile regression and reward model pre-training to improve the performance. We conduct experiments on a variety of long-term user engagement\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC", "topics": "Reinforcement Learning, Recommender Systems, Long-term User Engagement"}, {"title": "Deep FTRL-ORW: An Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Solving Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games", "description": "One of the most popular methods for learning Nash equilibrium (NE) in large-scale imperfect information extensiveform games (IIEFGs) is the neural variants of counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). CFR is a special case of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL). At each iteration, the neural variants of CFR update the agent\u2019s strategy via the estimated counterfactual regrets. Then, they use neural networks to approximate the new strategy, which incurs an approximation error. These approximation errors will accumulate since the counterfactual regrets at iteration t are estimated using the agent\u2019s past approximated strategies. Such accumulated approximation error causes poor performance. To address this accumulated approximation error, we propose a novel FTRL algorithm called FTRL-ORW, which does not utilize the agent\u2019s past strategies to pick the next iteration strategy. More importantly, FTRL-ORW can update its strategy via the trajectories sampled from the game, which is suitable to solve large-scale IIEFGs since sampling multiple actions for each information set is too expensive in such games. However, it remains unclear which algorithm to use to compute the next iteration strategy for FTRL-ORW when only such sampled trajectories are revealed at iteration t. To address this problem and scale FTRL-ORW to large-scale games, we provide a model-free method called Deep FTRL-ORW, which computes the next iteration strategy using model-free Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on two-player zero-sum IIEFGs show that Deep FTRL-ORW significantly outperforms existing model-free neural\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=PEEpuNwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=PEEpuNwAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "topics": "Deep Reinforcement Learning, Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games, Model-Free Deep Reinforcement Learning"}], "2005": [{"title": "A coalition formation framework based on transitive dependence", "description": "Coalition formation in multi-agent systems (MAS) is becoming increasingly important as it increases the ability of agents to execute tasks and maximize their payoffs.
