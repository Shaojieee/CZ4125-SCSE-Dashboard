In brief, observing that a route planning query (RPQ) with closer source and destination is easier to be accurately predicted, we fulfill a promising idea in DRPK to first detect the key segment of an RPQ by a classification model KSD, in order to split\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "topics": "Route Planning, Trajectory Analysis, Machine Learning"}, {"title": "River of No Return: Graph Percolation Embeddings for Efficient Knowledge Graph Reasoning", "description": "We study Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based embedding techniques for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. For the first time, we link the path redundancy issue in the state-of-the-art KG reasoning models based on path encoding and message passing to the transformation error in model training, which brings us new theoretical insights into KG reasoning, as well as high efficacy in practice. On the theoretical side, we analyze the entropy of transformation error in KG paths and point out query-specific redundant paths causing entropy increases. These findings guide us to maintain the shortest paths and remove redundant paths for minimized-entropy message passing. To achieve this goal, on the practical side, we propose an efficient Graph Percolation Process motivated by the percolation model in Fluid Mechanics, and design a lightweight GNN-based KG reasoning framework called Graph Percolation Embeddings (GraPE). GraPE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both transductive and inductive reasoning tasks while requiring fewer training parameters and less inference time.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "topics": "Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graph Reasoning, Graph Percolation Embeddings"}, {"title": "SIMGA: A Simple and Effective Heterophilous Graph Neural Network with Efficient Global Aggregation", "description": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) realize great success in graph learning but suffer from performance loss when meeting heterophily, i.e. neighboring nodes are dissimilar, due to their local and uniform aggregation. Existing attempts in incoorporating global aggregation for heterophilous GNNs usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which entails  computation efficiency for a graph with  nodes, leading to weak scalability to large graphs. In this paper, we propose SIMGA, a GNN structure integrating SimRank structural similarity measurement as global aggregation. The design of SIMGA is simple, yet it leads to promising results in both efficiency and effectiveness. The simplicity of SIMGA makes it the first heterophilous GNN model that can achieve a propagation efficiency near-linear to . We theoretically demonstrate its effectiveness by treating SimRank as a new interpretation of GNN and prove that the aggregated node representation matrix has expected grouping effect. The performances of SIMGA are evaluated with 11 baselines on 12 benchmark datasets, usually achieving superior accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art models. Efficiency study reveals that SIMGA is up to 5 faster than the state-of-the-art method on the largest heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "topics": "Graph Neural Networks, Heterophilous GNNs, Global Aggregation"}, {"title": "Seesaw Counting Filter: A Dynamic Filtering Framework for Vulnerable Negative Keys", "description": "Bloom filter is an efficient data structure for filtering negative keys (keys not in a given set) with substantially small space. However, in real-world applications, there widely exist vulnerable negative keys, which will bring high costs if not being properly filtered, especially when positive keys are added/deleted dynamically. Such problem gets more severe when keys within one set are dynamically added or deleted. Recently, there are works focusing on handling such (vulnerable) negative keys by incorporating learning techniques. These learning-based filters fail to work as the learning techniques can hardly handle incremental insertions or deletions. To address the problem, we propose SeeSaw Counting Filter (SSCF), which is innovated with encapsulating the vulnerable negative keys into a unified counter array named seesaw counter array, and dynamically modulating (or varying) the applied hash functions to\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "topics": "Dynamic Filtering Framework, Vulnerable Negative Keys"}, {"title": "Efficient Community Search in Edge-Attributed Graphs", "description": "Given a graph, searching for a community containing a query vertex is a fundamental problem and has found many applications. Most existing community search models are based on non-attributed or vertex-attributed graphs. In many real-world graphs, however, the edges carry the richest information to describe the interactions between vertices; hence, it is important to take the information into account in community search. In this paper, we conduct a pioneer study on the community search on edge-attributed graphs. We proposed the Edge-Attributed Community Search (EACS) problem, which aims to extract a subgraph that contains the given query vertex while its edges have the maximum attribute similarity. We prove that the EACS problem is NP-hard and propose both exact and 2-approximation algorithms to address EACS. Our exact algorithms run up to 2320.34 times faster than the baseline solution.

In large-scale tasks of finding a number of targets, it is particularly inconvenient as users are required to specify each criterion. To address this issue, we present Example Searcher, a system that allows users to search more efficiently in such tasks. Example Searcher adopts a novel way of location search that allows rich and interactive user inputs and searches for multiple target locations simultaneously. The system is powered by the state-of-the-art spatial search algorithm LORA, which efficiently performs spatial queries and searches for a set of locations that are similar to the given input examples as a whole.

In this paper, we present a general-purpose, distributed, information-centric random walk-based graph embedding framework, DistGER, which can scale to embed billion-edge graphs. DistGER incrementally computes information-centric random walks. It further leverages a multi-proximity-aware, streaming, parallel graph partitioning strategy, simultaneously achieving high local partition quality and excellent workload balancing across machines. DistGER also improves the distributed Skip-Gram learning model to generate node embeddings by optimizing the access locality, CPU throughput, and synchronization efficiency. Experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art distributed graph embedding frameworks, including KnightKing, DistDGL, and Pytorch-BigGraph, DistGER exhibits 2.33x-129x acceleration, 45% reduction in cross-machines communication, and > 10% effectiveness improvement in downstream tasks.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=ZDwbMg4AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "topics": "Distributed Systems, Graph Mining, Machine Learning"}, {"title": "Less is More: Towards Lightweight Cost Estimator for Database Systems", "description": "We present FasCo, a simple yet effective learning-based estimator for the cost of executing a database query plan.
