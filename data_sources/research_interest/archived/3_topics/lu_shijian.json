Distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D open-vocabulary segmentation models helps but it compromises the open-vocabulary feature significantly as the 2D models are mostly finetuned with close-vocabulary datasets. We tackle the challenges in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation by exploiting the open-vocabulary multimodal knowledge and object reasoning capability of pre-trained foundation models CLIP and DINO, without necessitating any fine-tuning. Specifically, we distill open-vocabulary visual and textual knowledge from CLIP into a neural radiance field (NeRF) which effectively lifts 2D features into view-consistent 3D segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce the Relevancy-Distribution Alignment loss and Feature-Distribution Alignment loss to respectively mitigate the ambiguities of CLIP features and distill precise object boundaries from DINO features, eliminating the need for segmentation annotations during training.

Such semantic misalignment circulates in pre-training, leading to inferior zero-shot performance in dense predictions due to insufficient visual concepts captured in textual representations.

In the light of this observation, we design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which disentangles high-frequency information explicitly.

However, most existing work randomly selects point features as anchors while building contrast, leading to a clear bias toward background points that often dominate in 3D scenes. Also, object awareness and foreground-to-background discrimination are neglected, making contrastive learning less effective. To tackle these issues, we propose a general foreground-aware feature contrast (FAC) framework to learn more effective point cloud representations in pre-training. FAC consists of two novel contrast designs to construct more effective and informative contrast pairs. The first is building positive pairs within the same foreground segment where points tend to have the same semantics. The second is that we prevent over-discrimination between 3D segments/objects and encourage foreground-to-background distinctions at the segment level with adaptive feature learning in a Siamese correspondence network, which adaptively learns feature correlations within and across point cloud views effectively. Visualization with point activation maps shows that our contrast pairs capture clear correspondences among foreground regions during pre-training.

In the light of this observation, we design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which disentangles high-frequency information explicitly.

To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach that views each tracklet as a continuous stream: at each timestamp, only the current frame is fed into the network to interact with multi-frame historical features stored in a memory bank, enabling efficient exploitation of sequential information. To achieve effective cross-frame message passing, a hybrid attention mechanism is designed to account for both long-range relation modeling and local geometric feature extraction.

PTTR consists of three novel designs. 1) Instead of random sampling, we design Relation-Aware Sampling to preserve relevant points to the given template during subsampling. 2) We propose a Point Relation Transformer for effective feature aggregation and feature matching between the template and search region. 3) Based on the coarse tracking results, we employ a novel Prediction Refinement Module to obtain the final refined prediction through local feature pooling. In addition, motivated by the favorable properties of the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) of point clouds in capturing object motion, we further design a more advanced framework named PTTR++, which incorporates both the point-wise view and BEV representation to exploit their complementary effect in generating high-quality tracking results. PTTR++ substantially boosts the tracking performance on top of PTTR with low computational overhead.

Based on the observations that text documents normally lie over a planar or smoothly curved surface and have a uniformly colored background, badly illuminated document images are binarized by using a smoothing polynomial surface, which estimates the shading variation and compensates the shading degradation based on the estimated shading variation. Badly illuminated document images are accordingly binarized through the global thresholding of the compensated document images. Compared with the reported methods, the proposed technique is tolerant to the variations in text size and document contrast. At the same time, it is much faster and able to produce a binary text image with little background noise.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uYmK-A0AAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=uYmK-A0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC"}, {"title": "A figure image processing system", "description": "Patent document images maintained by the U.S. patent database have a specific format, in which figures and descriptions are separated into different pages.

Based on the observation that illumination normally varies smoothly and document images often contain a uniformly colored background, the global shading variation is estimated by using a two-dimensional Savitzky-Golay filter that fits a least square polynomial surface to the luminance of a badly illuminated document image. With the knowledge of the global shading variation, shading degradation is then corrected through a compensation process that produces animage with roughly uniform illumination. Badly illuminated document images are accordingly binarized through the global thresholding of the compensated ones. Experiments show that the proposed thresholding technique is fast, robust, and efficient for the binarization of badly illuminated document images.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uYmK-A0AAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=uYmK-A0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC"}], "2006": [{"title": "Automatic document orientation detection and categorization through document vectorization", "description": "This paper presents an automatic orientation detection and categorization technique that is capable of detecting the orientation of multilingual documents with arbitrary skew and categorizing document images according to the underlying languages.
