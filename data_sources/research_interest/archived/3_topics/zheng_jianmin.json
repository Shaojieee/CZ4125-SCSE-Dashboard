The rows of M correspond to moving planes or moving quadrics that follow the parametric surface. Previous papers on the method of moving surfaces have shown that a simple base point has the effect of converting one moving quadric to a moving plane. A much more general version of the method of moving surfaces is presented in this paper that is capable of dealing with multiple base points. For example, a double base point has the effect (in this new version) of converting two moving quadrics into moving planes, eliminating one additional moving quadric, and eliminating a column of the matrix (ie, a blending function of the moving surfaces)\u2014thereby dropping the degree of the implicit equation by four. Furthermore, this is a unifying approach whereby tensor product surfaces, pure degree surfaces, and \u201ccorner-cut\u201d surfaces, can all be implicitized under the same framework and do not need to be treated as distinct cases. The central idea in this approach is that if a surface has a base point of multiplicity k, the moving surface blending functions must have the same base point, but of multiplicity k\u2212 1. Thus, we draw moving surface blending functions from the derivative ideal I, where I is the ideal of the parametric equations.

Unlike traditional multi-view stereo approaches, the neural implicit surface-based methods leverage neural networks to represent 3D scenes as signed distance functions (SDFs). However, they tend to disregard the reconstruction of individual objects within the scene, which limits their performance and practical applications. To address this issue, previous work ObjectSDF introduced a nice framework of object-composition neural implicit surfaces, which utilizes 2D instance masks to supervise individual object SDFs. In this paper, we propose a new framework called ObjectSDF++ to overcome the limitations of ObjectSDF. First, in contrast to ObjectSDF whose performance is primarily restricted by its converted semantic field, the core component of our model is an occlusion-aware object opacity rendering formulation that directly volume-renders object opacity to be supervised with instance masks. Second, we design a novel regularization term for object distinction, which can effectively mitigate the issue that ObjectSDF may result in unexpected reconstruction in invisible regions due to the lack of constraint to prevent collisions.

To find a safe and cost effective way of lifting, a team works for weeks or even months doing site investigation, planning and evaluations. This paper considers the lifting path planning problem for terrain cranes in complex environments. The lifting path planning problem takes inputs such as the plant environment, crane mechanical data, crane position, start and end lifting configurations to generate the optimal lifting path by evaluating costs and safety risks. We formulate the crane lifting path planning as a multi-objective nonlinear integer optimization problem with implicit constraints. It aims to optimize the energy cost, time cost and human operation conformity of the lifting path under constraints of collision avoidance and operational\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sGCf2k0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=sGCf2k0AAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC"}, {"title": "Reconsideration of T-spline data models and their exchanges using STEP", "description": "T-spline is a new approach to define freeform surfaces with relatively less control points than NURBS and is able to represent a model using a single surface without joining errors.

Considering that many real-world objects likely have sparse material distribution, we propose an optimization formulation with a carefully designed objective function and L0 regularization.

Unlike traditional multi-view stereo approaches, the neural implicit surface-based methods leverage neural networks to represent 3D scenes as signed distance functions (SDFs). However, they tend to disregard the reconstruction of individual objects within the scene, which limits their performance and practical applications. To address this issue, previous work ObjectSDF introduced a nice framework of object-composition neural implicit surfaces, which utilizes 2D instance masks to supervise individual object SDFs. In this paper, we propose a new framework called ObjectSDF++ to overcome the limitations of ObjectSDF. First, in contrast to ObjectSDF whose performance is primarily restricted by its converted semantic field, the core component of our model is an occlusion-aware object opacity rendering formulation that directly volume-renders object opacity to be supervised with instance masks. Second, we design a novel regularization term for object distinction, which can effectively mitigate the issue that ObjectSDF may result in unexpected reconstruction in invisible regions due to the lack of constraint to prevent collisions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our novel framework not only produces superior object reconstruction results but also significantly improves the quality of scene reconstruction.

In scenarios involving non-negligible hook mass or long rig-cable, the hook-payload unit exhibits double-pendulum behaviour, making the problem highly challenging. This article introduces an offline multi-objective anti-swing trajectory planning module for a Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system of autonomous double-pendulum tower cranes, addressing all the transient state constraints. A set of auxiliary outputs are selected by methodically analyzing the payload swing dynamics and are used to prove the differential flatness property of the crane operations. The flat outputs are parameterized via suitable B\\'{e}zier curves to formulate the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems in the flat output space. A novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Collective Oppositional Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (CO-GDE3) is employed as the optimizer. To obtain faster convergence and better consistency in getting a wide range of good solutions, a new population initialization strategy is integrated into the conventional GDE3. The computationally efficient initialization method incorporates various concepts of computational opposition. Statistical comparisons based on trolley and slew operations verify the superiority of convergence and reliability of CO-GDE3 over the standard GDE3.
