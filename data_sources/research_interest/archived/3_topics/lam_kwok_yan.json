On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital service providers to improve operational productivity and customer satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users' personal data, which could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a serious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data leaving their stored location. However, depending on the nature of the digital services, data captured at different locations may carry different significance to the business operation, hence a weighted aggregation will be highly desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. Furthermore, to prevent leakage of user data from the aggregated gradients, cryptographic mechanisms are needed to allow secure aggregation of FL. In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhanced FL scheme for supporting secure weighted aggregation.

Their attack was soon improved and several query recovery attacks were discovered recently. In response to the advancements of volumetric leakage attacks, volume-hiding searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) schemes have been proposed (Kamara and Moataz, Eurocrypt\u201919 & Patel et al., CCS\u201919). In these schemes, the database is padded in a clever way so that the volume (ie, the number of responses) for any search query is the same or computationally indistinguishable while keeping the storage complexity and search complexity as small as possible. Unfortunately, existing volume-hiding SSE schemes do not support atomic updates (ie, addition/deletion of an arbitrary keyword-document pair), which is the most common update operation considered in the SSE literature.

Our basic idea is to hide both the identity and reputation of the validators by periodically changing the identity and reputation commitments (i.e., aliases), which makes it much more difficult for slowly adaptive attackers to identify validators with high reputation value.

For example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between 3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to 8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing of ISTCN.

Tensor network decomposition and distributed tensor computation have been widely used in signal processing and machine learning for dimensionality reduction and large-scale optimization.

Therefore, we propose randomized algorithms to decompose big data into randomized tensor network representations and analyze the privacy leakage for 1D to 3D data tensors.

Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that requires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network users. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol participants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of dishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum sharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading process so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized access by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use of blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and traceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading reputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of heterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support users with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam satellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous spectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum.

Experiments on Twitter demonstrate that the behavior-interior-aware CF models achieve better adoption prediction results than the state-ofthe-art methods, and the joint consideration of similarity in user preference and their impact propagation results in a significant improvement than treating them\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC"}, {"title": "A Comparative Study of Transactional and Semantic Approaches for Predicting Cascades on Twitter.", "description": "The availability of massive social media data has enabled the prediction of people\u2019s future behavioral trends at an unprecedented large scale. Information cascades study on Twitter has been an integral part of behavior analysis. A number of methods based on the transactional features (such as keyword frequency) and the semantic features (such as sentiment) have been proposed to predict the future cascading trends. However, an in-depth understanding of the pros and cons of semantic and transactional models is lacking. This paper conducts a comparative study of both approaches in predicting information diffusion with three mechanisms: retweet cascade, url cascade, and hashtag cascade. Experiments on Twitter data show that the semantic model outperforms the transactional model, if the exterior pattern is less directly observable (ie hashtag cascade). When it becomes more directly observable (ie retweet and url cascades), the semantic method yet delivers approximate accuracy (ie url cascade) or even worse accuracy (ie retweet cascade). Further, we demonstrate that the transactional and semantic models are not independent, and the performance gets greatly enhanced when combining both.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC"}, {"title": "Caching Efficiency Enhancement at Wireless Edges with Concerns on User\u2019s Quality of Experience", "description": "Content caching is a promising approach to enhancing bandwidth utilization and minimizing delivery delay for new-generation Internet applications. The design of content caching is based on the principles that popular contents are cached at appropriate network edges in order to reduce transmission delay and avoid backhaul bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a cooperative caching replacement and efficiency optimization scheme for IP-based wireless networks. Wireless edges are designed to establish a one-hop scope of caching information table for caching replacement in cases when there is not enough cache resource available within its own space. During the course, after receiving the caching request, every caching node should determine the weight of the required contents and provide a response according to the availability of its own caching space. Furthermore, to increase the caching efficiency from a practical perspective, we introduce the concept of quality of user experience (QoE) and try to properly allocate the cache resource of the whole networks to better satisfy user demands. Different caching allocation strategies are devised to be adopted to enhance user QoE in various circumstances.

However, data privacy remains a significant concern. Federated Learning (FL) encourages data sharing in ML without requiring data to leave users' devices but imposes heavy computation and communications overheads on mobile devices. Hierarchical FL (HFL) alleviates this problem by performing partial model aggregation at edge servers. HFL can effectively reduce energy consumption and latency through effective resource allocation and appropriate user assignment. Nevertheless, resource allocation in HFL involves optimizing multiple variables, and the objective function should consider both energy consumption and latency, making the development of resource allocation algorithms very complicated. Moreover, it is challenging to perform user assignment, which is a combinatorial optimization problem in a large search space. This article proposes a spectrum resource optimization algorithm (SROA) and a two-stage iterative algorithm (TSIA) for HFL. Given an arbitrary user assignment pattern, SROA optimizes CPU frequency, transmit power, and bandwidth to minimize system cost.

We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n.
