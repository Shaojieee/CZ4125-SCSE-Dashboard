The model depends on a representative physical property of the alveolar region termed the effective diffusivity, a function of the diffusivity, solubility, morphology and interface topography of each alveolar constituent. Unfortunately, the direct determination of the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region is impractical because of the difficulty in describing the internal geometry of each alveolar constituent. However, the transient solution of the macroscopic model can be used in conjunction with the lung-diffusing capacity (measured in a clinical setting) to determine the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region. With the effective diffusivity known, the three-dimensional effects of red blood-cell distribution on the lung-diffusing capacity can be predicted via numerical simulations. The results, obtained for normal (random), uniform, center-cluster, cornercluster, and several chain-like distributions, reveal a strong relationship between the type of red-cell distribution and the lung-diffusing capacity. The model developed has been used in order to study the impact of microscopic particles whose presence in the alveolar region may affect the lung-diffusing capacity.

Many approaches address the issue of unlabelled datasets by tightly coupling machine learning algorithms with interactive visualisations. Using appropriate techniques, analysts can play an active role in a highly interactive and iterative machine learning process to label the dataset and create meaningful partitions. While this principle has been implemented either for unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised machine learning tasks, the combination of all three methodologies remains challenging. In this paper, a visual analytics approach is presented, combining a variety of machine learning capabilities with four linked visualisation views, all integrated within the mVis (multivariate Visualiser) system. The available palette of techniques allows an analyst to perform exploratory data analysis on a multivariate dataset and divide it into meaningful labelled partitions, from which a classifier can be built. In the workflow, the analyst can label interesting patterns or outliers in a semi-supervised process supported by active learning. Once a dataset has been interactively labelled, the analyst can continue the workflow with supervised machine learning to assess to what degree the subsequent classifier has effectively learned the concepts expressed in the labelled training dataset. Using a novel technique called automatic dimension selection, interactions the analyst had with dimensions of the multivariate dataset are used to steer the machine learning algorithms.

The model depends on a representative physical property of the alveolar region termed the effective diffusivity, a function of the diffusivity, solubility, morphology and interface topography of each alveolar constituent. Unfortunately, the direct determination of the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region is impractical because of the difficulty in describing the internal geometry of each alveolar constituent. However, the transient solution of the macroscopic model can be used in conjunction with the lung-diffusing capacity (measured in a clinical setting) to determine the effective diffusivity of the alveolar region. With the effective diffusivity known, the three-dimensional effects of red blood-cell distribution on the lung-diffusing capacity can be predicted via numerical simulations. The results, obtained for normal (random), uniform, center-cluster, cornercluster, and several chain-like distributions, reveal a strong relationship between the type of red-cell distribution and the lung-diffusing capacity. The model developed has been used in order to study the impact of microscopic particles whose presence in the alveolar region may affect the lung-diffusing capacity.

To avoid these problems, we propose to use bimanual interaction and separate the functions of a hand --- the dominant hand controls 3D position and rotation, while the other hand controls grasping and releasing. This interaction is similar to playing the theremin --- an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by hands of the performer.

We have proposed a function-defined VRML shape node, which allows the content creators to describe any complex models with relatively small functions compared to the large-size polygonal mesh models. These function-defined shapes can be used together with the common VRML shapes. The design, the implementation details, and the application examples of the proposed node are discussed.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC"}, {"title": "Organized by", "description": "The following topics on cyberworld are discussed: philosophy, ethics, law and security of cyberworlds; distributed simulation and distributed virtual environment; shared and virtual worlds; geometric modeling and visualization for cyberworlds; intelligent agents; datamining and warehousing; cyberbusiness; cyberlearning; cybermuseums; and cyberinformation.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8A7kHCYAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=8A7kHCYAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C"}], "1994": [{"title": "Time dependent set-theoretic operations for functionally represented solid objects", "description": "The uniform function representation of multidimensional geometric objects and the theory of R-functions are used to implement set-theoretic operations over time dependent solids.
