We prove that with conformance to specific rules regulating the advancement of LPs, the events to be cancelled by a straggler message can be determined using a range of the state vector. Thus, knowledge of the range enables any LP to recover from the receipt of a straggler message at the cost of at most one rollback (i.e., rollback optimal).

Each LP contains a portion of the state corresponding to the PP it models, and maintains a local clock of how far it has progressed in the simulation. Processing of an LP is driven by some changes of state in the corresponding PP, and may also induce a change of state at some other PPs. To model the interaction between PPs (ie, changes of an PP a ecting PPs somewhere else), timestamped messages are transferred between LPs. Therefore, a simulator (or referred to as the simulation network) is constructed by LPs and message-passing links.Intuitively, parallelism in the physical system seems to be automatically translated into the computational concurrency. However, this exploration of parallelism in discrete event simulation is elusive because temporal aspects of simulation cannot be easily mapped to parallel computers. To ensure the correctness of simulation, one must guarantee that all LPs obey the local causality constrains, that is, an LP must process events in nondecreasing timestamp order 9]. Since LPs are executed in parallel, their local time may advance asynchronously.

As Area-Of-Interest (AOI) defines each player's interests, an entity normally maintains a subscriber list of players whose AOIs cover the position of the entity. To maintain the subscriber list, players are required to send AOI updates. Unfortunately, AOI update is vulnerable to information exposure (IE) attack especially on P2P infrastructure. Sensitive information, such as player's position, can be revealed during AOI update without owner's authorization and attention. This eventually results in an unfair game.

State saving and recovery are necessary for cloning a federate at runtime. However it is very difficult to have a generic state manipulation mechanism for any existing federate, as these can be developed independently and freely. The correctness of replicating a running federate significantly depends on the Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) software. The distributed simulation also needs fault tolerance to provide robustness at runtime. This paper proposes a decoupled federate architecture to address the above issues. A normal federate is decoupled into two processes, which execute the simulation model (virtual federate) and the local RTI component (physical federate) respectively. The decoupled approach interlinks the two processes together via Inter-Process Communication. The virtual federate interacts with the RTI through the standard RTI service interface supported by a customized library. The decoupled architecture ensures the correct replication of federates and facilitates fault tolerance at the RTI level. At the same time, it provides user transparency and reusability to existing federate codes.

In the recent decade, video anomaly detection (VAD) techniques have achieved remarkable success in detecting individual-level abnormal behaviors (eg, sudden running, fighting and stealing), but research on VAD for CABs is rather limited. Unlike individual-level anomaly, CABs usually do not exhibit salient difference from the normal behaviors when observed locally, and the scale of CABs could vary from one scenario to another. In this paper, we present a systematic study to tackle the important problem of VAD for CABs with a novel crowd motion learning framework, multi-scale motion consistency network (MSMC-Net). MSMC-Net first captures the spatial and temporal crowd motion consistency information in a graph representation. Then, it simultaneously trains multiple feature graphs constructed at different scales to capture rich crowd patterns.

Since LPs are executed in parallel, their simulation time may advance asynchronously. Thus, an LP may not always receive messages with increasing timestamps. However, in order to correctly simulate the physical system, each LP has to process its incoming messages in their global timestamp order. In the past 20 years, there are many protocols that have been proposed to solve the above synchronization problem. In general, these parallel simulation protocols can be broadly classi ed into two groups: conservative or optimistic.In a conservative approach [1], an LP can make progress in simulation only when the causality is preserved.

Each LP contains a portion of the state corresponding to the PP it models, and maintains a local clock of how far it has progressed in the simulation. Processing of an LP is driven by some changes of state in the corresponding PP, and may also induce a change of state at some other PPs. To model the interaction between PPs (ie, changes of an PP a ecting PPs somewhere else), timestamped messages are transferred between LPs. Therefore, a simulator (or referred to as the simulation network) is constructed by LPs and message-passing links.Intuitively, parallelism in the physical system seems to be automatically translated into the computational concurrency. However, this exploration of parallelism in discrete event simulation is elusive because temporal aspects of simulation cannot be easily mapped to parallel computers. To ensure the correctness of simulation, one must guarantee that all LPs obey the local causality constrains, that is, an LP must process events in nondecreasing timestamp order 9]. Since LPs are executed in parallel, their local time may advance asynchronously. Therefore, time synchronization protocols have to be exploited, which broadly fall into two paradigms: conservative (eg 2, 5, 6]) and optimistic (eg 11]).

However, a purely time-stepped execution is inefficient in situations where the states of individual agents are independent of other agents and thus easily predictable far into the simulated future. In this work, we propose a method to accelerate microscopic traffic simulations based on identifying independence among agent state updates. Instead of iteratively updating an agent's state throughout a sequence of time steps, a computationally inexpensive \"fast-forward\" function advances the agent's state to the time of its earliest possible interaction with other agents.

Can M&S help improve AI/ML predictions?", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QdmIiyIAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=QdmIiyIAAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC", "topics": "Intelligent Modeling and Simulation Lifecycle, High Performance Computing (HPC), Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)"}, {"title": "Spatial iterative coordination for parallel simulation-based optimization of large-scale traffic signal control", "description": "Applying simulation-based optimization to city-scale traffic signal optimization can be challenging due to the large search space resulting in high computational complexity. A divide-and-conquer approach can be used to partition the problem and optimized separately, which leads to faster convergence. However, the lack of coordination among the partial solutions may yield a poor-quality global solution. In this paper, we propose a new method for simulation-based optimization of traffic signal control, called spatially iterative coordination for parallel optimization (SICPO), to improve coordination among the partial solutions and reduce synchronization between the partitioned regions. The traffic scenario is simulated to obtain the interactions, which is used to spatially decompose the scenario into regions and identify interdependencies between the regions. Based on the regions, the problem is divided into\u00a0\u2026", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QdmIiyIAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=QdmIiyIAAAAJ:bXQfdp6S9ecC", "topics": "Parallel Computing, Optimization, Traffic Signal Control"}], "1990": [{"title": "Highly Transparent Monitoring of Real-Time", "description": "Tel: UK. 0392-264061 Monitoring is fundamental to program testing, debugging and performance analysis. It can provide both statistical data for evaluating the performance of a program and dynamic execution information for demonstrating execution states, thus presenting the overall behaviour of a program to the user. However, in monitoring distributed real-time systems, a major difficulty arises from the intrusive nature of the monitor. This paper describes an approach, based on\" Logical Clocks\u201d, which aims to minimize the amount of interference, thus achieving a high transparency. Since the logical time of a process now plays the same role as that of real time when running without the monitor, it is possible to replace real-time constraints with logical-time constraints. In this way, the approach may be applied to the monitoring of real-time systems.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QdmIiyIAAAAJ&cstart=400&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=QdmIiyIAAAAJ:4n0clTBhZ78C"}]}
