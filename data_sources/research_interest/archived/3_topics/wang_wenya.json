The emergence of opinion mining techniques comes along with the excessive volume of text data from social media made available to the public, such as product reviews, blog posts, forum discussions and Twitter website for social network.   Sentiment analysis has been actively studied among the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community since 2000. At this early stage, the main focus of sentiment analysis dealt with the overall sentiment polarity towards a given sentence or document, which we call coarse-grained sentiment analysis. For example, given a review sentence: \"The sound is clean and clear\", the desired output should be positive, without knowing the exact object the reviewer is talking about. For this task, various machine learning classifiers and deep learning models were developed to learn opinion-bearing features for the whole sentence or document to make predictions. However, a mere sentiment score is far from enough to provide all the necessary information for decision making. That's the reason why fine-grained opinion mining becomes more popular in a later stage.   Fine-grained opinion mining, or aspect-based sentiment analysis, mainly focuses on finding the opinion targets (aspects) from a given sentence and the emotions expressed towards them. This is more related to information extraction. Take the previous example review sentence, the model should be able to extract sound as the aspect and clean and clear as the opinion.

The emergence of opinion mining techniques comes along with the excessive volume of text data from social media made available to the public, such as product reviews, blog posts, forum discussions and Twitter website for social network.   Sentiment analysis has been actively studied among the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community since 2000. At this early stage, the main focus of sentiment analysis dealt with the overall sentiment polarity towards a given sentence or document, which we call coarse-grained sentiment analysis. For example, given a review sentence: \"The sound is clean and clear\", the desired output should be positive, without knowing the exact object the reviewer is talking about. For this task, various machine learning classifiers and deep learning models were developed to learn opinion-bearing features for the whole sentence or document to make predictions. However, a mere sentiment score is far from enough to provide all the necessary information for decision making. That's the reason why fine-grained opinion mining becomes more popular in a later stage.   Fine-grained opinion mining, or aspect-based sentiment analysis, mainly focuses on finding the opinion targets (aspects) from a given sentence and the emotions expressed towards them. This is more related to information extraction. Take the previous example review sentence, the model should be able to extract sound as the aspect and clean and clear as the opinion.

Various attempts have been proposed for IE via feature engineering or deep learning. However, most of them fail to associate the complex relationships inherent in the task itself, which has proven to be especially crucial. For example, the relation between 2 entities is highly dependent on their entity types. These dependencies can be regarded as complex constraints that can be efficiently expressed as logical rules. To combine such logic reasoning capabilities with learning capabilities of deep neural networks, we propose to integrate logical knowledge in the form of first-order logic into a deep learning system, which can be trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. The integrated framework is able to enhance neural outputs with knowledge regularization via logic rules, and at the same time update the weights of logic rules to comply with the characteristics of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed model on multiple IE tasks.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eOKISncAAAAJ&citation_for_view=eOKISncAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC"}, {"title": "Syntactically meaningful and transferable recursive neural networks for aspect and opinion extraction", "description": "In fine-grained opinion mining, extracting aspect terms (a.k.a. opinion targets) and opinion terms (a.k.a. opinion expressions) from user-generated texts is the most fundamental task in order to generate structured opinion summarization.

We adopt the MaxSAT semantics to model logic inference process and smoothly incorporate a weighted version of MaxSAT that connects deep neural networks and a graphical model in a joint framework. The joint model feeds deep learning outputs to a weighted MaxSAT layer to rectify the erroneous predictions and can be trained via end-to-end gradient descent.

However, the training process for quantization is non-differentiable, which leads to either infinite or zero gradients () wrt .

In this paper, we propose a novel layer-wise quantization method for deep neural networks, which only requires limited training data (1% of original dataset). Specifically, we formulate parameters quantization for each layer as a discrete optimization problem, and solve it using Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which gives an efficient closed-form solution. We prove that the final performance drop after quantization is bounded by a linear combination of the reconstructed errors caused at each layer. Based on the proved theorem, we propose an algorithm to quantize a deep neural network layer by layer with an additional weights update step to minimize the final error.
