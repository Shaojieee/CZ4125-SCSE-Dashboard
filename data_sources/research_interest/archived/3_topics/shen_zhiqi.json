Existing reputation-based decision-making models cannot help workers decide when and to whom to sub-delegate tasks. In this paper, we proposed a reputation aware task sub-delegation (RTS) approach to bridge this gap. By jointly considering a worker's reputation, workload, the price of its effort and its trust relationships with others, RTS can be implemented as an intelligent agent to help workers make sub-delegation decisions in a distributed manner.

For outcomes, we assessed frailty status using the modified Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP) and CFS; physical performance using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); and Hand Grip Strength (HGS) at baseline and 8-week. User experience was explored using the System Usability Scale (SUS), interest-enjoyment subscale of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and open-ended questions. We analyzed effectiveness using repeated-measures tests on pre-post scores, and usability using a convergent mixed-method approach via thematic analysis of open-ended responses and descriptive statistics of usability/interest-enjoyment scales. Results Sixteen participants (71.8\u00b15.5 years) completed the 8-week study. There was a significant improvement in FFP score (-0.5, p<.05, effect size, r=0.43), but not CFS (-1.0, p=.10, r=0.29).

However, new technologies and devices normally used to develop the exergames may be over complex and difficult for the elderly to use, mainly because the hardware and software components involved in modern exergames appear unfamiliar or even alien to the elderly mentally. Moreover, the elderly consider the investment to acquire the unfamiliar technology is too high. Therefore, the study of familiarity issues of the elderly is important and necessary to guide the interaction design of new technologies so that they can be built upon the elderly's prior knowledge of real world interactions to help the elderly to apply their existing skills to a new domain. In this paper, we propose three dimensions of familiarity design and the approach to design familiar exergames for the elderly. By following this approach, we hope to increase the usability of the exergames that the elderly can naturally interact with. For case study, we introduce the design principles followed when implementing the Virtual Escape Exergame to illustrate the usage of our proposed familiarity design approach to develop an exergame in a familiar virtual environment for the elderly.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC"}, {"title": "Less Annotation on Personalized Activity Recognition Using Context Data", "description": "Miscellaneous mini-wearable devices (e.g. wristbands, smartwatches, armbands) have emerged in our life, capable of recognizing activities of daily living, monitoring health information, so on.

In a QPDF, we use contextual priority to represent the relative importance of combinations of goals in different contexts and define associated strategies for deriving decision preferences based on prioritized goal combinations. To automate the decision computation, we map QPDFs to Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) frameworks so that we can utilize existing ABA argumentative engines for our implementation.

To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems. Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial applications and a valuable baseline for future research.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC", "topics": "Information Retrieval"}, {"title": "CSP-RM: Reputation Management Decision Support for Crowdsourcing Service Providers", "description": "The increasing popularity of crowdsourcing has resulted in the emergence of multiple crowdsourcing service providers (CSPs), such as Mechnical Turk and Crowdflower, which compete to attract crowd workers (CWs).

Its main objective is to predict the user's next interested POI based on her previous check-in information. Most existing methods directly use users' historical check-in trajectories to construct various graphs to assist sequential models to complete this task. However, as users' check-in data is extremely sparse, it is difficult to capture the potential relations between POIs by directly using these check-in data. To this end, we propose the Sequence-based Neighbour search and Prediction Model (SNPM) for next POI recommendation. In SNPM, the RotatE knowledge graph embedding and Eigenmap methods are used to extract POI relationships implied in check-in data, and build the POI similarity graph. Then, we enhance the model's generalized representations of POIs' general features by aggregating similar POIs. As the context is typically rich and valuable when making Next POI predictions, the sequence model selects which POIs to aggregate not only depends on the current state, but also needs to consider the previous POI sequence. Therefore, we construct a Sequence-based, Dynamic Neighbor Graph (SDNG) to find the similarity neighbourhood and develop a Multi-Step Dependency Prediction model (MSDP) inspired by RotatE, which explicitly leverage information from previous states. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C", "topics": "Graph Mining, Knowledge Graph Embedding, Recommendation Systems"}, {"title": "Revisiting Item Promotion in GNN-Based Collaborative Filtering: A Masked Targeted Topological Attack Perspective", "description": "Graph neural networks (GNN) based collaborative filtering (CF) has attracted increasing attention in e-commerce and financial marketing platforms. However, there still lack efforts to evaluate the robustness of such CF systems in deployment. Fundamentally different from existing attacks, this work revisits the item promotion task and reformulates it from a targeted topological attack perspective for the first time. Specifically, we first develop a targeted attack formulation to maximally increase a target item's popularity. We then leverage gradient-based optimizations to find a solution. However, we observe the gradient estimates often appear noisy due to the discrete nature of a graph, which leads to a degradation of attack ability. To resolve noisy gradient effects, we then propose a masked attack objective that can remarkably enhance the topological attack ability. Furthermore, we design a computationally efficient approach to the proposed attack, thus making it feasible to evaluate large-large CF systems. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our attack in analyzing the robustness of GNN-based CF more practically.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=EA2T_lwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=EA2T_lwAAAAJ:PyEswDtIyv0C", "topics": "Graph Neural Networks, Collaborative Filtering, Topological Attack"}, {"title": "A Teachable Agent to Enhance Elderly's Ikigai", "description": "Ikigai is a Japanese term that is argued to be the most used index of well-being in Japanese studies about the elderly.

Most existing works of 3D generative models directly take the Gaussian prior as input for the decoder to generate 3D point clouds, which fail to learn disentangled latent codes, leading noisy interpolated results. Most of the GAN-based models fail to discriminate the local geometries, resulting in the point clouds generated not evenly distributed at the object surface, hence degrading the point cloud generation quality. Moreover, prevailing methods adopt computation-intensive frameworks, such as flow-based models and Markov chains, which take plenty of time and resources in the training phase. To resolve these limitations, this paper proposes a unified style-aware network architecture combining both point-wise distance loss and adversarial loss, StarNet which is able to reconstruct and generate high-fidelity and even 3D point clouds using a mapping network that can effectively disentangle the Gaussian prior from input's high-level attributes in the mapped latent space to generate realistic interpolated objects.
