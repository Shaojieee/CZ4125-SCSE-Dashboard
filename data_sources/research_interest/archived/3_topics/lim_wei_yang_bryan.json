Recently, hierarchical FL (HFL) has been proposed in which data owners, i.e., workers, can first transmit their updated model parameters to edge servers for intermediate aggregation. This reduces the instances of global communication and straggling workers. To enable efficient HFL, it is important to address the issues of edge association in the context of non-cooperative players, i.e., workers, edge servers, and model owner.
