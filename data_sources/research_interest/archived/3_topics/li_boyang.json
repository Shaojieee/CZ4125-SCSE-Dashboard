However, a crucial impediment to this end lies in the difficulty of generalizing to data distributions that come from real-world scenarios. Typically such distributions follow Zipf's law which states that only a small portion of the collected object classes will have abundant examples (head); while most classes will contain just a few (tail). In this paper, we propose to study a novel task concerning the generalization of visual relationships that are on the distribution's tail, i.e. we investigate how to help AI systems to better recognize rare relationships like <S:dog, P:riding, O:horse>, where the subject S, predicate P, and/or the object O come from the tail of the corresponding distributions. To achieve this goal, we first introduce two large-scale visual-relationship detection benchmarks built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets. We also propose an intuitive evaluation protocol that gives credit to classifiers who prefer concepts that are semantically close to the ground truth class according to wordNet- or word2vec-induced metrics. Finally, we introduce a visiolinguistic version of a Hubless loss which we show experimentally that it consistently encourages classifiers to be more predictive of the tail classes while still being accurate on head classes.

However, the perception of humor is personal due to different humor preferences. Thus, a given passage can be regarded as funny to different degrees by different readers. This makes training humorous text recognition models that can adapt to diverse humor preferences highly challenging. In this paper, we propose the FedHumor approach to recognize humorous text contents in a personalized manner through federated learning (FL). It is a federated BERT model capable of jointly considering the overall distribution of humor scores with humor labels by individuals for given texts. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant advantages of FedHumor in recognizing humor contents accurately for people with diverse humor preferences compared to 9 state-of-the-art humor recognition approaches.", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QwL4z2UAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=QwL4z2UAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC"}, {"title": "Joint understanding of actors, literary characters, and movies", "description": "Systems, methods, and articles of manufacture are disclosed for learning models of movies, keywords, actors, and roles, and querying the same.

Such training produces an optimized model with the Gaussian distributions representing movies, keywords, and actors, as well as shift vectors that change the means of movie Gaussian distributions and model archetypical roles.
