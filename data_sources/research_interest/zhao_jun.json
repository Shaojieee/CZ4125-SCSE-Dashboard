On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital service providers to improve operational productivity and customer satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users' personal data, which could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a serious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data leaving their stored location. However, depending on the nature of the digital services, data captured at different locations may carry different significance to the business operation, hence a weighted aggregation will be highly desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. Furthermore, to prevent leakage of user data from the aggregated gradients, cryptographic mechanisms are needed to allow secure aggregation of FL. In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhanced FL scheme for supporting secure weighted aggregation.

Information from the Metaverse Map can then be downloaded into individual IoVs on demand and be delivered as AR scenes to the driver.

Extensive label noise will lead to sub-optimal solutions doubtlessly. To solve these problems, we propose an Anti-Noise Learning (ANL) approach, which contains two modules.

Among them, model extraction attacks fool the target model by generating adversarial examples on a substitute model. The core of such an attack is training a substitute model as similar to the target model as possible, where the simulation process can be categorized in a data-dependent and data-free manner. Compared with the data-dependent method, the data-free one has been proven to be more practical in the real world since it trains the substitute model with synthesized data. However, the distribution of these fake data lacks diversity and cannot detect the decision boundary of the target model well, resulting in the dissatisfactory simulation effect. Besides, these data-free techniques need a vast number of queries to train the substitute model, increasing the time and computing consumption and the risk of exposure.

Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that requires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network users. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol participants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of dishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum sharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading process so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized access by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use of blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and traceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading reputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of heterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support users with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam satellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous spectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum. By leveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic spectrum sharing mechanism with traceability, openness and transparency for whole trading process is presented. Numerical results are also provided to evaluate the system benefits and spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.", "publication_year": 2020, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=C5_aIrgAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=C5_aIrgAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "title": "POSTER: Blockchain-Based Differential Privacy Cost Management System", "authors": ["Leong Mei Han", "Yang Zhao", "Jun Zhao"], "description": "Privacy preservation is a big concern for various sectors.

In this paper, we propose a Foreground-Guided Texture-Focused Network (FTN) for Re-ID, which can weaken the representation of unrelated background and highlight the attributes person-related in an end-to-end manner. FTN consists of a semantic encoder (S-Enc) and a compact foreground attention module (CFA) for Re-ID task, and a texture-focused decoder (TF-Dec) for reconstruction task. Particularly, we build a foreground-guided semi-supervised learning strategy for TF-Dec because the reconstructed ground-truths are only the inputs of FTN weighted by the Gaussian mask and the attention mask generated by CFA. Moreover, a new gradient loss is introduced to encourage the network to mine the texture consistency between the inputs and the reconstructed outputs.

Ten years down the road, the awareness of blockchain has evolved to not just being known as cryptocurrency and the trading of the coins, but the unique characteristics of the technology itself are becoming more recognised and appealing to business services than ever before. The BT today, has advanced to Blockchain 3.0, where improvements are made to flaws identified from previous generations and more developers are exploring ways to adopt the technology in the Internet of Things. However, there are still many challenges faced that are hindering the growth and adoption of BT by businesses and they remain persistent even in today\u2019s context. In this paper, we will look into some of the more prominent challenges of BT and discuss further on one of them-the scalability issue and off-chain approaches. The review of scalability challenge and discussion on off-chain approaches shall provide some insights to benefits, design patterns, solutions and considerations that stakeholders and developers can reference in their blockchain project that look to scale and be future proof.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=C5_aIrgAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=C5_aIrgAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "title": "Results of k-Connectivity and Minimum Vertex Degree in Random s-Intersection Graphs", "authors": ["Jun Zhao", "Osman Yagan", "Virgil Gligor"], "description": "Random s-intersection graphs have recently received much interest [1\u20139]. In a random s-intersection graph, each vertex is assigned to a set of items in some manner, and two vertices have an edge in between if and only if they share at least s item (s). In particular, in a uniform random s-intersection graph, each vertex independently selects the same number of items uniformly at random from a common item pool, while in a binomial random s-intersection graph, each item in a item pool is independently attached to each vertex with the same probability. These two graph models have numerous applications; eg, using uniform random s-intersection graph for cryptanalysis [10, 11], and to model secure wireless sensor networks [2, 7, 12] and online social networks [13, 14], and using a binomial random s-intersection graph for clustering analysis [15], classification [16] and the design of integrated circuits [17]. For binomial/uniform random s-intersection graphs, we present results related to k-connectivity and minimum vertex degree. Specifically, we derive the asymptotically exact probabilities and asymptotic zero\u2013one laws for the following three properties:(i) k-vertex-connectivity,(ii) k-edge-connectivity and (iii) the property of minimum vertex degree being at least k.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=C5_aIrgAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=C5_aIrgAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "title": "Topological Properties of Wireless Sensor Networks Under the Q-Composite Key Predistribution Scheme With Unreliable Links (CMU-CyLab-14-002)", "authors": ["Jun Zhao", "Osman Yagan", "Virgil D Gligor"], "description": "The seminal q-composite key predistribution scheme [3] (IEEE S&P 2003) is used prevalently for secure communications in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Yagan [12] (IEEE IT 2012) and we [15] (IEEE ISIT 2013) explore topological properties of WSNs employing the q-composite scheme in the case of q = 1 with unreliable communication links modeled as independent on/off channels. However, it is challenging to derive results for general q under such on/off channel model. In this paper, we resolve such challenge and investigate topological properties related to node degree in WSNs operating under the q-composite scheme and the on/off channel model. Our results apply to general q, yet there has not been any work in the literature reporting the corresponding results even for q = 1, which are stronger than those about node degree in [12], [15]. Specifically, we show that the number of nodes with an arbitrary degree asymptotically converges to a Poisson distribution, present the asymptotic probability distribution for the minimum node degree of the network, and establish the asymptotically exact probability for the property that the minimum node degree is at least an arbitrary value. Numerical experiments confirm the validity our analytical findings. References: [3] H. Chan, A. Perrig, and D. Song. Random key predistribution schemes for sensor networks.
