To overcome this limitation, we introduce Object-level Representation Learning (ORL), a new self-supervised learning framework towards scene images. Our key insight is to leverage image-level self-supervised pre-training as the prior to discover object-level semantic correspondence, thus realizing object-level representation learning from scene images. Extensive experiments on COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on several downstream tasks. Furthermore, ORL improves the downstream performance when more unlabeled scene images are available, demonstrating its great potential of harnessing unlabeled data in the wild.

Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental results on ImageNet and several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches.

Considering the power of implicit parallelism, we are drawn to the idea that population-based search strategies provide an idyllic setting for leveraging the underlying synergies between objective function landscapes of seemingly distinct optimization tasks, particularly when they are solved together in a unified space with a single population of evolving individuals. Allowing the principles of evolution to autonomously exploit the available synergies can often lead to accelerated convergence for otherwise complex tasks.

We propose SkipE-RNN, a self-evolutionary recurrent neural network with dynamically evolving skipped-recurrent-connection for the best utilization of previously observed label information while classifying the current data. When the data label is unavailable, SkipE-RNN uses an auto-learned mapping function to find the best match from the already known data labels and updates the network parameter accordingly. Later, upon availability of true data label, if the previously mapped label is found to be incorrect, SkipE-RNN employs a regularization technique along with the parameter updating process, so as to penalize the model. In addition, SkipE-RNN has inborn power of self-adjusting the network capacity by growing/pruning hidden nodes to cope with the evolving nature of data stream.

Particularly, we propose a memetic multi-agent demonstration learning approach (MeMAS-P) with improvement over existing work to allow agents to improve their performance by building candidate models and accord-ingly predicting behaviors of their opponents. Experiments based on an adapted mine eld navigation task have shown that MeMAS-P could provide agents with ability to acquire increasing level of learning capability and reduce the candi-date model space by sharing meme-inspired demonstrations with respect to their representative knowledge and unique candidate models.", "publication_year": 2016, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0]}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "title": "A tree-structured covalent-bond-driven molecular memetic algorithm for optimization of ring-deficient molecules", "authors": ["MM Ellabaan", "Stephanus Daniel Handoko", "Yew-Soon Ong", "Chee Keong Kwoh", "SA Bahnassy", "FM Elassawy", "HY Man"], "description": "With enormous success in both science and engineering, the recent advances in evolutionary computation\u2014particularly memetic computing\u2014is gaining increasing attention in the molecular optimization community.

CLAP entails using agents to seek a concurrent allocation of one different object for every agent, to optimize a linear sum efficiency function as their (soft) social goal. Anchoring in the standard framework of automated negotiation allows an original belief-desire-intention (BDI) negotiation model for CLAP to be conceptually separated into a BDI assignment protocol and an adopted strategy. Facilitated by this conceptual separation, the contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) providing a rigorous analysis of the protocol and demonstrating its salient properties and 2) formulating new strategies using a novel idea of cooperative concession. Four different strategies for a negotiation agent and the arbitration agent provide 16 arbitration-negotiation combinations running with the protocol, and these are\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2008, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=h9oWOsEAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=h9oWOsEAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "title": "Grid technology in financial planning-a methodology for portfolio structuring", "authors": ["Jing Tang", "Meng Hiot Lim", "Yew Soon Ong"], "description": "This report outlines the development of a grid-enabled computational methodology for solving the portfolio optimization problem. Unlike the classical treatment of a set of mean-variance optimized portfolios as a deterministic efficient frontier, we adopt a novel treatment of the frontier as a distribution of points on a statistical front. This is made possible by our stochastic algorithms, specifically an evolutionary programming (EP) approach that is able to derive meaningful portfolios for the statistical front. More importantly, the EP approach is inherently a parallel search algorithm, making it amenable to exploit the immense computational resources that a grid computing architecture can provide. In order to derive statistically meaningful front, one requires a great number of points to form the efficient band. With a grid computing framework, one is able to farm out such computationally expensive tasks and derive\" interesting\" portfolios to create the band. Such a capability lays the necessary backbone for developing further analytic methodology for portfolio rebalancing, an important aspect of financial planning. This is significant since in recent years, financial planning has permeated into the mindset of the population.

Given such an issue, we denote the frame importance as its contribution to the expected reward on a particular frame, and hypothesize that adapting such frame importance could benefit the performance of the distilled student policy. To verify our hypothesis, we analyze why and how frame importance matters in RL settings. Based on the analysis, we propose an importance prioritized PD framework that highlights the training on important frames, so as to learn efficiently.
