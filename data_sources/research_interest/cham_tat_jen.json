This method of generating hypotheses from state-space search does not require the use of discrete features unlike classical multiple-hypothesis tracking.

In this paper, we present an approach for pluralistic image completion-the task of generating multiple and diverse plausible solutions for image completion. A major challenge faced by learning-based approaches is that usually only one ground truth training instance per label. As such, sampling from conditional VAEs still leads to minimal diversity. To overcome this, we propose a novel and probabilistically principled framework with two parallel paths. One is a reconstructive path that utilizes the only one given ground truth to get prior distribution of missing parts and rebuild the original image from this distribution. The other is a generative path for which the conditional prior is coupled to the distribution obtained in the reconstructive path. Both are supported by GANs. We also introduce a new short+ long term attention layer that exploits distant relations among decoder and encoder features, improving appearance consistency.

It has been recently used in solving the imbalanced classification problem eg, in asymmetric boosting. However, to date, the relationship between an empirical asymmetric error and its generalization counterpart has not been addressed. Bounds on the classical generalization error are not directly applicable since different penalties are associated with the false positive rate and the false negative rate respectively, and the class probability is typically ignored in the training set. In this paper, we present a bound on the expected asymmetric error of any convex combination of classifiers based on its empirical asymmetric error. We also show that the bound is a generalization of one of the latest (and tightest) bounds on the classification error of the combined classifier.", "publication_year": 2012, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=Lx3X7W0AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "title": "Image relighting by analogy", "authors": ["Xiao Teng", "Tat-Jen Cham"], "description": "We propose and analyze an example-based framework for relighting images. In this framework, there are a number of images of reference objects captured under different illumination conditions. Given an input image of a new object captured under one of the previously observed illumination conditions, new images can be synthesized for the input object under all the other illumination conditions that are present in the reference images. It does not require any other prior knowledge on the reference and target objects, except that they share the same albedo. Though it is appreciated if the reference objects have similar shape as the target object, sphere or ellipsoid which has plenty of local geometry samples are sufficient to build up a look-up table, as this method solves the problem locally.

The co-occurrence statistics between features across a pair of images are learned from a training set comprising matched and mismatched image pairs - these are expressed in the form of a cross-feature ratio table. The proposed method does not require feature-to-feature correspondences, but instead identifies and exploits feature co-occurrences that are able to provide discriminative result from the transformation.

These interactive display walls are implemented using multiple cost-effective video cameras and ultra-portable computer projectors, circumventing the need for special, expen- sive and cumbersome equipment. In this report, we document the achievements made during the course of the research project, and describe some of the ma- jor research and development work carried out. These include (i) a display wall based on casually-placed projectors, (ii) virtual persistent displays that are able to dynamically eliminate shadows cast by users blocking the projectors, and (iii) a framework for detecting and recognizing symbolic hand gestures.

It has been recently used in the imbalanced binary classification problem, where the probability of one class far outweighs that of the other. Classical bounds on the generalization error are not directly applicable to explain the ability to generalize of a binary classifier learned with an asymmetric error. Because in this context, there are different penalties associated with the false positive rate and the false negative rate respectively. In this paper, we present some margin-based bounds on an asymmetric error of a binary classifier based on its empirical asymmetric error. We focus our study on convex combinations of classifiers like classifiers learned from boosting and neural networks. Based on our bounds, it is suggested that machine learning methods that use an asymmetric error to learn should produce a classifier that has different margins for examples coming from different classes, rather than treating the margins equally like current methods do.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}]
