Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers.

In this paper, we propose a novel drug-target interaction prediction algorithm, namely neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization (NRLMF). Specifically, the proposed NRLMF method focuses on modeling the probability that a drug would interact with a target by logistic matrix factorization, where the properties of drugs and targets are represented by drug-specific and target-specific latent vectors, respectively. Moreover, NRLMF assigns higher importance levels to positive observations (i.e., the observed interacting drug-target pairs) than negative observations (i.e., the unknown pairs). Because the positive observations are already experimentally verified, they are usually more trustworthy. Furthermore, the local structure of the drug-target interaction data has also been exploited via neighborhood regularization to achieve better prediction accuracy.

In crowdsourcing systems that can be modeled as multi-agent trust networks consist of resource constrained trustee agents (ie, workers), workers may need to further sub-delegate tasks to others if they determine that they cannot complete all pending tasks before the stipulated deadlines. Existing reputation-based decision-making models cannot help workers decide when and to whom to sub-delegate tasks. In this paper, we proposed a reputation aware task sub-delegation (RTS) approach to bridge this gap. By jointly considering a worker's reputation, workload, the price of its effort and its trust relationships with others, RTS can be implemented as an intelligent agent to help workers make sub-delegation decisions in a distributed manner. The resulting task allocation maximizes social welfare through efficient utilization of the collective capacity of a crowd, and provides provable performance guarantees.

Notwithstanding the progress, issues still remain. Because of the widely complained disadvantages of limited battery capacity and long charging time, charging convenience has become a top concern that greatly hinders the adoption of EVs. Specialized EV charging station, which provides more than 10 times faster charging speed than domestic charging, is therefore a critical element for successful EV promotion. While most existing researches focus on optimizing spatial placement of charging stations, they are inflexible and inefficient against rapidly changing urban structure and traffic pattern. Therefore, this paper approaches the management of EV charging stations from the pricing perspective as a more flexible and adaptive complement to established charging station placement. In this paper, we build a realistic pricing model in consideration of residential travel pattern and EV drivers\u2019 self-interested charging behavior, traffic congestion, and operating expense of charging stations.

Nevertheless, these approaches require additional information (ie, labeled or unlabeled data, meta-information) from the target domain during the training stage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Generalizable Independent Latent Excitation (GILE) for human activity recognition, which greatly enhances the cross-person generalization capability of the model. Our proposed method is superior to existing methods in the sense that it does not require any access to the target domain information. Besides, this novel model can be directly applied to various target domains without re-training or fine-tuning. Specifically, the proposed model learns to automatically disentangle domain-agnostic and domain-specific features, the former of which are expected to be invariant across various persons. To further remove correlations between the two types of features, a novel Independent Excitation mechanism is incorporated in the latent feature space.

The DyETC problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), the solution of which is very challenging due to its 1) multi-dimensional state space, 2) multi-dimensional, continuous and bounded action space, and 3) time-dependent state and action values. Due to the complexity of the formulated MDP, existing methods cannot be applied to our problem. Therefore, we develop a novel algorithm, PG-beta, which makes three improvements to traditional policy gradient method by proposing 1) time-dependent value and policy functions, 2) Beta distribution policy function and 3) state abstraction. Experimental results show that, compared with existing ETC schemes, DyETC increases traffic volume by around 8%, and reduces travel time by around 14: 6% during rush hour.

Moreover, GCL4SR uses subgraphs of WITG to augment the representation of each interaction sequence. Two auxiliary learning objectives have also been proposed to maximize the consistency between augmented representations induced by the same interaction sequence on WITG, and minimize the difference between the representations augmented by the global context on WITG and the local representation of the original sequence.

Furthermore, a distributed computing network may include straggling nodes that run intermittently slower. This results in a longer overall time needed to execute the computation tasks, thereby limiting the performance of distributed computing.

As such, it is necessary to synchronize a DT with its physical counterpart to ensure that its status is accurate for virtual businesses in the Metaverse.

Based on the collected sensing data and the value decay rate of the DTs, the VSPs can determine synchronization intensities to maximize their payoffs. In our proposed dynamic hierarchical framework, the lower-level evolutionary game captures the VSPs selection by the IoT device population, and the upper-level differential game captures the VSPs payoffs, which are affected by the synchronization strategy, IoT devices selections, and the DTs value status, given VSPs are simultaneous decision makers. We further consider the case in which some VSPs are first movers and extend it as a Stackelberg differential game.

In this paper, we approach this problem systematically by developing a model-agnostic Contrastive-Curiosity-Driven Learning Framework (CCLF), which can fully exploit sample importance and improve learning efficiency in a self-supervised manner. Facilitated by the proposed contrastive curiosity, CCLF is capable of prioritizing the experience replay, selecting the most informative augmented inputs, and more importantly regularizing the Q-function as well as the encoder to concentrate more on under-learned data. Moreover, it encourages the agent to explore with a curiosity-based reward. As a result, the agent can focus on more informative samples and learn representation invariances more efficiently, with significantly reduced augmented inputs.

Extending these methods to multi-attribute face image editing scenarios will introduce undesired excessive attribute change, e.g., text-relevant attributes are overly manipulated and text-irrelevant attributes are also changed. In order to address these challenges and achieve natural editing over multiple face attributes, we propose a new decoupling training scheme where we use group sampling to get text segments from same attribute categories, instead of whole complex sentences. Further, to preserve other existing face attributes, we encourage the model to edit the latent code of each attribute separately via a entropy constraint. During the inference phase, our model is able to edit new face images without any test-time optimization, even from complex textual prompts.

A large scale MAS may have billions of possible ways of organization, depending on the number of agents, the roles, and the relationships among these agents.

In this report, we propose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing hierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm, called the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with a repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic hierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array representation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operatorliterate. A case study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is provided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which lead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. Compared with the traditional genetic operators, the newly introduced operators produced better organizations of higher utility more consistently in a variety of test cases.

Recommendation scenarios can be divided into different type (eg, pre-, during-, post-purchase, campaign, promotion, bundle) for different user groups or different businesses. For different scenarios, the goals of recommendation are different. This is reflected by the different performance metrics employed. In addition, online promotional campaigns, which attract high traffic volumes, are also a critical factor affecting e-commerce recommender systems. Typically, prior to a promotional campaign, the Add-to-Cart Rate (ACR) is the target of optimization. During the campaign, this changes to Gross Merchandise Volumes (GMV).

Results and Conclusion The aortic structural remodeling developed progressively at 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks after SAD. Aortic structural remodeling after SAD expressed mainly as aortic hypertrophy due to SMC growth and collagen accumulation. The aortic contraction elicited by norepinephrine (NE) was progressively increased 8, 16 and 32 weeks after SAD. The aortic relaxation elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) was depressed 8, 16 and 32 weeks after SAD. In addition, in 32-week SAD rats the NE-induced contraction was not increased by endothelial denudation. These indicated that the increased contraction and depressed relaxation after SAD were related to the change of endothelium and/or the change of interaction between endothelium and SMC.

It pulls together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications. 2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less ``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE. Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the distribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise mutual information estimation. We furthermore discuss the superiority of proposed loss functions with other design alternatives.

Self-supervised frameworks are adopted in vision and language fields to solve this issue, but the lack of EEG-specific theoretical foundations hampers their applicability across various tasks. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven cross-view contrastive learning framework (KDC2), which integrates neurological theory to extract effective representations from EEG with limited labels. The KDC2 method creates scalp and neural views of EEG signals, simulating the internal and external representation of brain activity. Sequentially, inter-view and cross-view contrastive learning pipelines in combination with various augmentation methods are applied to capture neural features from different views.

Compared with the existing average similarity method (AvgSim), vMF-Sim considers the variance of each class in addition to the average similarity. With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy.

To date, such cooperative decision making among attackers has been ignored in the security games literature. To address the issue of cooperation among attackers, we introduce a novel coalitional security game (CSG) model.

A defender in a CSG can delete a set of edges, incurring a cost for deleting each edge, with the goal of optimally limiting the attackers\u2019 ability to form effective coalitions (in terms of successfully attacking high value targets).

It aims to automatically detect human faces from a photo image and further name the faces with the corresponding human names. Recently, mining web facial images on the internet has emerged as a promising paradigm towards auto face annotation. In this paper, we present a demonstration system of search-based face annotation: FANS\u2014Face ANnotation by Searching large-scale web facial images. Given a query facial image for annotation, we first retrieve a short list of the most similar facial images from a web facial image database, and then annotate the query facial image by mining the topranking facial images and their corresponding labels with sparse representation techniques. Our demo system was built upon a large-scale real-world web facial image database with a total of 6, 025 persons and about 1 million facial images. This paper demonstrates the potential of searching and mining web-scale weakly labeled facial images on the internet to tackle the challenging face annotation problem, and addresses some open problems for future exploration by researchers in web community.

In our model, topics are represented by embedding vectors, and are shared across documents. The probability of each word is influenced by both its local context and its topic. A variational inference method yields the topic embeddings as well as the topic mixing proportions for each document. Jointly they represent the document in a low-dimensional continuous space.

To fully mine those information, this paper proposes a novel framework of Learning to Name Faces (L2NF)\u2013a unified multimodal learning approach for search-based face annotation, which consists of the following major components:(i) we enhance the weak labels of top-ranked similar images by exploiting the \u201clabel smoothness\" assumption;(ii) we construct the multimodal representations of a facial image by extracting different types of features;(iii) we optimize the distance measure for each type of features using distance metric learning techniques; and finally (iv) we learn the optimal combination of multiple modalities for annotation through a learning to rank scheme.

Most of the existing disambiguation methods are built on similarity measures, eg,\u201cJaccard Coefficient\u201d, between two sets of papers to be disambiguated, each set represented by a set of categorical features, eg, coauthors and published venues 1. Such measures perform bad when the two sets are small, which is typical in Author Name Disambiguation. In this paper, we propose a novel categorical set similarity measure. We model an author\u2019s preference, eg, to venues, using a categorical distribution, and derive a likelihood ratio to estimate the likelihood that the two sets are drawn from the same distribution. This likelihood ratio is used as the similarity measure to decide whether two sets belong to the same author. This measure is mathematically principled and verified to perform well even when the cardinalities of the two compared sets are small.
