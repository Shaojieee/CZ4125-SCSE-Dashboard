Though many approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of unfair ratings, most of them use the credibility of the rating provider alone to decide whether the rating is unfair without considering other aspects of the rating itself. Models that do consider multiple aspects often combine them through arbitrarily set weights. Therefore, they cannot work well when the credibility is not evaluated accurately or when the weights are not set properly. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a reputation model which considers and combines the temporal, similarity and quantity aspects of the user ratings based on fuzzy logic to improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation.

However, determining the interestingness of items based on user preferences alone is not sufficient. In human psychology, researchers have found an important intrinsic motivation, ie, curiosity, for seeking interestingness in social context. Instead of focusing on users\u2019 preferences, curiosity highlights the impact of the unknown and unexpectedness on a person\u2019s feeling of interestingness.

However, the problem of unfair testimonies makes it difficult and remains an open issue for the consumer to accurately evaluate the provider's reputation. To address this problem, various approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of unfair testimonies. However, most existing works focus on countering unfair testimonies for reputation systems supporting binary ratings. To resolve this limitation, in this paper, we propose a two-stage clustering approach to filter unfair testimonies, especially for reputation systems using multi-nominal ratings.
