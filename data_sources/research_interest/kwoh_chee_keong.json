As the increasing amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data are available, we are able to identify protein complexes from PPI networks.

However, experimentally determined protein complex data, especially of those involving more than two protein partners, are relatively limited in the current state-of-the-art high-throughput experimental techniques. Nevertheless, many techniques (such as yeast-two-hybrid) have enabled systematic screening of pairwise protein-protein interactions en masse. Thus computational approaches for detecting protein complexes from protein interaction data are useful complements to the limited experimental methods. They can be used together with the experimental methods for mapping the interactions of proteins to understand how different proteins are organized into higher-level substructures to perform various cellular functions. Given the abundance of pairwise protein interaction data from high-throughput genome-wide experimental screenings, a protein interaction network can be constructed from protein interaction data by considering individual proteins as the nodes, and the existence of a physical interaction between a pair of proteins as a link. This binary protein interaction graph can then be used for detecting protein complexes using graph clustering techniques. In this paper, we review and evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques for computational detection of protein complexes, and discuss some promising research directions in this field.

The reduction of the number of samples, hence, the reduction of computational cost is especially important when hierarchical clustering is used in the second stage.

The resulting pairwise protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is then mined for densely connected regions that are identified as putative protein complexes.

We model and evaluate the spread of influenza epidemic with intervention strategies of workforce shift and its combination with school closure, and examine the impacts of temporal factors, namely the trigger threshold and the duration of an intervention. By comparing simulation results for intervention scenarios with different temporal factors, we find that combined interventions do not always outperform individual interventions and are more effective only when the duration is longer than 6 weeks or school closure is triggered at the 5% threshold; combined interventions may be more effective if school closure starts first when the duration is less than 4 weeks or workforce shift starts first when the duration is longer than 4 weeks.

We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses.

The first step, interaction binning or InterBIN, groups PPIs together to more accurately estimate the likelihood (Bin-Confidence score) that the protein pairs interact for each biological or computational evidence source.

Existing methods for finding DNA sequence motifs of recombination hotspots often rely on the enrichment of co-localizations between hotspots and short DNA patterns, which ignore the cross-individual variation of recombination rates and sequence polymorphisms in the population.

Protein binding interfaces and their atomic contacts are typically defined by simple criteria, such as distance-based definitions that only use some threshold of spatial distance in previous studies. These definitions neglect the nearby atomic organization of contact atoms, and thus detect predominant contacts which are interrupted by other atoms. It is questionable whether such kinds of interrupted contacts are as important as other contacts in protein binding. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new definition called beta (\u03b2) atomic contacts. Our definition, founded on the \u03b2-skeletons in computational geometry, requires that there is no other atom in the contact spheres defined by two contact atoms; this sphere is similar to the van der Waals spheres of atoms. The statistical analysis on a large dataset shows that \u03b2 contacts are only a small fraction of conventional distance-based contacts. To empirically quantify the importance of \u03b2 contacts, we design \u03b2ACV, an SVM classifier with \u03b2 contacts as input, to classify homodimers from crystal packing. We found that our \u03b2ACV is able to achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance superior to SVM classifiers with distance-based contacts as input. Our \u03b2ACV also outperforms several existing methods when being evaluated on several datasets in previous works.

Recently, many computational models have been developed to predict the antigenic variants without considerations of explicitly modeling the interdependencies between the channels of feature maps.

However, existing deep learning methods for RUL prediction are not completely successful due to the following two reasons. First, relying on a single objective function to estimate the RUL will limit the learned representations and thus affect the prediction accuracy. Second, while longer sequences are more informative for modelling the sensor dynamics of equipment, existing methods are less effective to deal with very long sequences, as they mainly focus on the latest information. To address these two problems, we develop a novel attention-based sequence to sequence with auxiliary task (ATS2S) model. In particular, our model jointly optimizes both reconstruction loss to empower our model with predictive capabilities (by predicting next input sequence given current input sequence) and RUL prediction loss to minimize the difference between the predicted RUL and actual RUL. Furthermore, to better handle longer sequence, we employ the attention mechanism to focus on all the important input information during training process. Finally, we propose a new dual-latent feature representation to integrate the encoder features and decoder hidden states, to capture rich semantic information in data.

Previous works of active learning, however, focused on the tasks of entity recognition and protein-protein interactions, but not on event extraction tasks for multiple event types. They also did not consider the evidence of event participants, which might be a clue for the presence of events in unlabeled documents. Moreover, the confidence scores of events produced by event extraction systems are not reliable for ranking documents in terms of informativity for supervised learning. We here propose a novel committee-based active learning method that supports multi-event extraction tasks and employs a new statistical method for informativity estimation instead of using the confidence scores from event extraction systems. Our method is based on a committee of two systems as follows: We first employ an event extraction system to filter potential false negatives among unlabeled documents, from which the system does not extract any event. We then develop a statistical method to rank the potential false negatives of unlabeled documents 1) by using a language model that measures the probabilities of the expression of multiple events in documents and 2) by using a named entity recognition system that locates the named entities\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2016, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0]}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jVn0wDMAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=jVn0wDMAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "title": "ARG-walker: inference of individual specific strengths of meiotic recombination hotspots by population genomics analysis", "authors": ["Hao Chen", "Peng Yang", "Jing Guo", "Chee Keong Kwoh", "Teresa M Przytycka", "Jie Zheng"], "description": "Meiotic recombination hotspots play important roles in various aspects of genomics, but the underlying mechanisms for regulating the locations and strengths of recombination hotspots are not yet fully revealed. Most existing algorithms for estimating recombination rates from sequence polymorphism data can only output average recombination rates of a population, although there is evidence for the heterogeneity in recombination rates among individuals. For genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of recombination hotspots, an efficient algorithm that estimates the individualized strengths of recombination hotspots is highly desirable. In this work, we propose a novel graph mining algorithm named ARG-walker, based on random walks on ancestral recombination graphs (ARG), to estimate individual-specific recombination hotspot strengths. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ARG-walker is able to distinguish the hot allele of a recombination hotspot from the cold allele. Integrated with output of ARG-walker, we performed GWAS on the phased haplotype data of the 22 autosome chromosomes of the HapMap Asian population samples of Chinese and Japanese (JPT+CHB).

Unlike existing approaches that either use statistical distances or adversarial techniques, we leverage contrastive learning solely to mitigate the distribution shift across the different domains. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal mixup strategy to generate two intermediate augmented views for the source and target domains. Subsequently, we leverage contrastive learning to maximize the similarity between each domain and its corresponding augmented view. The generated views consider the temporal dynamics of time-series data during the adaptation process while inheriting the semantics among the two domains. Hence, we gradually push both domains towards a common intermediate space, mitigating the distribution shift across them.

Due to limited computational resources, the protein-protein docking approach has been developed under the assumption of rigid docking, in which one of the two protein partners remains rigid during the protein associations and water contribution is ignored or implicitly presented. Despite obtaining a number of acceptable complex predictions, it seems to-date that most initial rigid docking algorithms still find it difficult or even fail to discriminate successfully the correct predictions from the other incorrect or false positive ones. To improve the rigid docking results, re-ranking is one of the effective methods that help re-locate the correct predictions in top high ranks, discriminating them from the other incorrect ones. In this paper, we propose a new re-ranking technique using a new energy-based scoring function, namely IFACEwat - a combined Interface Atomic Contact Energy (IFACE) and water effect. The IFACEwat aims to further improve the discrimination of the near-native structures of the initial rigid docking algorithm ZDOCK3.0.2. Unlike other re-ranking techniques, the IFACEwat explicitly implements interfacial water into the protein interfaces to account for the water-mediated contacts during the protein interactions. Our results showed that the IFACEwat increased both the numbers of the near-native structures and improved their ranks as compared to the initial rigid docking ZDOCK3.0.2.

This mutation, located at the side of an abnormally large cluster of water in the inter-subunit interface, reduces the thermostability of the enzyme. Why and how these water molecules are directly related to the excessive thermolability of the mutant have not been investigated in structural biology. This work compares the structure of the E104D mutant with its wild type counterparts. It is found that the water topology in the dimer interface of HsTIM is atypical, having a \"wet-core-dry-rim\" distribution with 16 water molecules tightly packed in a small deep region surrounded by 22 residues including GLU104. These water molecules are co-conserved with their surrounding residues in non-archaeal TIMs (dimers) but not conserved across archaeal TIMs (tetramers), indicating their importance in preserving the overall quaternary structure. As the structural permutation induced by the mutation is not significant, we hypothesize that the excessive thermolability of the E104D mutant is attributed to the easy propagation of atoms' flexibility from the surface into the core via the large cluster of water. It is indeed found that the B factor increment in the wet region is higher than other regions, and, more importantly, the B factor increment in the wet region is maintained in the deeply buried core.

When the datasets are noisy, our method can still successfully identify most BNs with the same efficiency. When compared with two existing methods with the same settings, our method achieves a better comprehensive performance than both of them, especially for small training sample sizes.

It remains a surprisingly open problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large number of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly exploit the multi-level diversity in the large number of metrics, subspaces, and clusters, in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel multi-diversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can thereby be constructed.

In many applications, feature is the input of models so as to generate a meaningful prediction. While a large amount of model-centric solutions are proposed to improve the capabilities of models, there is very limited exploration on how to discover useful feature interactions from a data-centric perspective.  In this work, we propose a general framework named Feature Shapley with the purpose of discovering useful high-order feature interactions based on Feature Shapely values and thereby generating new features.  Since computing exact Feature Shapley values is computationally infeasible, Monte-Carlo approximation and early truncation trick are applied for efficient estimation of Feature Shapley values in this work.  Experimental results indicate that the decisive feature interactions exploited by Feature Shapley are of vital importance for the Click-through rate (CTR) prediction and asset pricing task.  With decisive feature interactions exploited by Feature Shapley, even simple models (e.g., linear regression (LR) or shallow neural network) could achieve similar or even better performance comparing with more complex approaches and keep their superior interpretability at the same time.", "publication_year": 2021, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jVn0wDMAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=jVn0wDMAAAAJ:ji7lAbPyDbYC", "title": "A Systematic Evaluation of Domain Adaptation Algorithms On Time Series Data", "authors": ["Mohamed Ragab", "Emadeldeen Eldele", "Wee Ling Tan", "Chuan-Sheng Foo", "Zhenghua Chen", "Min Wu", "Chee Kwoh", "Xiaoli Li"], "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation methods aim to generalize well on unlabeled test data that may have a different (shifted) distribution from the training data. Such methods are typically developed on image data, and their application to time series data is less explored. Existing works on time series domain adaptation suffer from inconsistencies in evaluation schemes, datasets, and base neural network architectures. Moreover, labeled target data are usually employed for model selection, which violates the fundamental assumption of unsupervised domain adaptation. To address these issues, we propose AdaTime, a standard framework to systematically and fairly evaluate different domain adaptation methods on time series data. Specifically, we standardize the base neural network architectures and benchmarking datasets, while also exploring more realistic model selection approaches that can work with no labeled data or few labeled samples. Our evaluation includes adaptations of state-of-the-art visual domain adaptation methods to time series data in addition to recent methods specifically developed for time series data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate 10 state-of-the-art methods on 3 representative datasets spanning 15 cross-domain scenarios. Our results suggest that with careful selection of hyper-parameters, visual domain adaptation methods are competitive with methods proposed for time series domain adaptation. In addition, we find that model selection plays a key role and different selection strategies can significantly affect performance.

The evolution of influenza viruses remains to be the main obstacle in the effectiveness of antiviral treatments due to rapid mutations. Previous work has been investigated to reveal the determinants of virulence of the influenza A virus. To further facilitate flu surveillance, explicit detection of influenza virulence is crucial to protect public health from potential future pandemics.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a weighted ensemble convolutional neural network for the virulence prediction of influenza A viruses named VirPreNet that uses all 8 segments. Firstly, mouse lethal dose 50 is exerted to label the virulence of infections into two classes, namely avirulent and virulent. A numerical representation of amino acids named ProtVec is applied to the 8-segments in a distributed manner to encode the biological sequences. After splittings and embeddings of influenza strains, the ensemble convolutional neural network is constructed as the base model on the influenza dataset of each segment, which serves as the VirPreNet\u2019s main part. Followed by a linear layer, the initial predictive outcomes are integrated and assigned with different weights for the final prediction. The experimental results on the collected influenza dataset indicate that VirPreNet achieves state-of-the-art performance combining ProtVec with our proposed architecture. It outperforms baseline methods on the independent testing data. Moreover, our proposed model reveals the importance of PB2 and HA segments on the virulence prediction.

Nonetheless, the approaches mainly rely on sequence alignments which could potentially lead to spurious mutations obtained by comparing sequences from different clades that coexist during particular periods of time. To address this issue, we propose a phylogenetic tree-based pipeline that takes into account the evolutionary structure in the sequence data. Assuming that the sequences evolve progressively under a strict molecular clock, considering a competitive model that is based on a certain Markov model, and using a resampling approach to obtain robust estimates, we could capture statistically significant single-mutations and co-mutations during the sequence evolution. Moreover, by considering the results obtained from analyses that consider all paths and the longest path in the resampled trees, we can categorize the mutational sites and suggest their relevance. Here we applied the pipeline to investigate the 50 years of evolution of the HA sequences of influenza A/H3N2 viruses.

Since the method takes into account the evolutionary structure presents in the sequence data, spurious mutations obtained by comparing sequences from different clades could be removed.

An important type of cellular responses to the signals is the cell fate decision, e.g., apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of cell fate regulation are still unclear, thus comprehensive and detailed kinetic models are not yet available. Alternatively, data-driven models are promising to bridge signaling data with the phenotypic measurements of cell fates. The traditional linear model for data-driven modeling of signaling pathways has its limitations because it assumes that the a cell fate is proportional to the activities of signaling proteins, which is unlikely in the complex biological systems. Therefore, we propose a power-law model to relate the activities of all the measured signaling proteins to the probabilities of cell fates. In our experiments, we compared our nonlinear power-law model with the linear model on three cancer datasets with phosphoproteomics and cell fate measurements, which demonstrated that the nonlinear model has superior performance on cell fates prediction.

Design Subjects underwent total sleep deprivation and completed a 10-min PVT every 1\u20132 h in a controlled laboratory setting. Participants were categorized as vulnerable or resistant to sleep deprivation, based on a median split of lapses that occurred following sleep deprivation. Standard reaction time, drift diffusion model (DDM), and wavelet metrics were derived from PVT response times collected at baseline. A support vector machine model that incorporated maximum relevance and minimum redundancy feature selection and wrapper-based heuristics was used to classify subjects as vulnerable or resistant using rested data. Setting Two academic sleep laboratories. Participants Independent samples of 135 (69 women, age 18 to 25 y), and 45 (3 women, age 22 to 32 y) healthy adults. Measurements and Results In both datasets, DDM measures, number of consecutive reaction times that differ by more than 250 ms, and two wavelet features were selected by the model as features predictive of vulnerability to sleep deprivation. Using the best set of features selected in each dataset, classification accuracy was 77% and 82% using fivefold stratified cross-validation, respectively.

Most existing algorithms for estimating recombination rates from sequence polymorphism data can only output average recombination rates of a population, although there is evidence for the heterogeneity in recombination rates among individuals. For genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of recombination hotspots, an efficient algorithm that estimates the individualized strengths of recombination hotspots is highly desirable.  Results In this work, we propose a novel graph mining algorithm named ARG-walker, based on random walks on ancestral recombination graphs (ARG), to estimate individual-specific recombination hotspot strengths. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ARG-walker is able to distinguish the hot allele of a recombination hotspot from the cold allele. Integrated with output of ARG-walker, we performed GWAS on the phased haplotype data of the 22 autosome chromosomes of the HapMap Asian population samples of Chinese and Japanese (JPT+CHB). Significant cis-regulatory signals have been detected, which is corroborated by the enrichment of the well-known 13-mer motif CCNCCNTNNCCNC of PRDM9 protein.

Thus uncovering its regulatory mechanisms has broad impact on biomedical research. Despite the recent identification of the zinc finger protein PRDM9 and its 13-mer binding motif as major regulators for meiotic recombination hotspots, other regulators remain to be discovered. Existing methods for finding DNA sequence motifs of recombination hotspots often rely on the enrichment of co-localizations between hotspots and short DNA patterns, which ignore the cross-individual variation of recombination rates and sequence polymorphisms in the population. Our objective in this paper is to capture signals encoded in genetic variations for the discovery of recombination-associated DNA motifs. Results Recently, an algorithm called \"LDsplit\" has been designed to detect the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and proximal meiotic recombination hotspots. The association is measured by the difference of population recombination rates at a hotspot between two alleles of a candidate SNP. Here we present an open source software tool of LDsplit, with integrative data visualization for recombination hotspots and their proximal SNPs. Applying LDsplit on SNPs inside an established 7-mer motif bound by PRDM9 we observed that SNP alleles preserving the original motif tend to have higher recombination rates than the opposite alleles that disrupt the motif.

The quality of the in utero environment significantly influences health over the lifecourse.

Accordingly, neonate methylomes contain molecular memory of the individual in utero experience. However, interindividual variation in methylation can also be a consequence of DNA sequence polymorphisms that result in methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTLs) and, potentially, the interaction between fixed genetic variation and environmental influences. We surveyed the genotypes and DNA methylomes of 237 neonates and found 1423 punctuate regions of the methylome that were highly variable across individuals, termed variably methylated regions (VMRs), against a backdrop of homogeneity. MethQTLs were readily detected in neonatal methylomes, and genotype alone best explained \u223c25% of the VMRs.

Recently, many genomic and epigenomic features have been associated with recombination hotspots, but none of them can explain hotspots consistently. It is highly desirable to integrate the different features into a predictive model, and study the relation of the features with hotspots and themselves with a systems approach. Moreover, due to rapid and dynamic evolution of recombination hotspots, regulatory mechanisms of hotspots that are evolutionarily conserved among species remain unclear.  We propose a machine learning approach that encode genomic and epigenomic features into a support vector machine (SVM). Trained on known hotspots and coldspots in human and mouse genomes, the model is able to predict hotspots based on the features with good performance in both species.

There can be different types of cardiac arrhythmias depending upon causes like point of origin of action potential and obstruction of normal conduction path. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is one of them in which the ventricles contract before the atrial contraction. PVC itself is not life threatening except when number of premature ventricular beats exceed four per minute. This cardiac arrhythmia is certainly a precursor to a life threatening disease called ventricular fibrillation, in which a patient could die minutes after he gets a heart attack unless some defibrillation is performed. Hence there is a need to detect PVC. The most commonly used signal in clinical practice for arrhythmia detection is the electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG conveys information regarding the electrical function of the heart by altering the shape of its constituent waves, namely the P, QRS, and T waves. Thus the required tasks of ECG processing are reliable recognition of these waves, and accurate measurement of clinically important parameters measured from the temporal distribution of the ECG constituent waves.A general approach of ECG analysis for arrhythmia detection has been to preprocess ECG signal to filter out the noise along with the P and T waves. Then the signal is passed through a nonlinear transformation, for example, derivative and square, etc., to enhance the QRS complex [5]. Finally, either using threshold or by applying certain decision rules, QRS complexes present in the signal are determined.

Many ML/DL models have been developed for malware detection using features extracted from dynamic analysis. Most of these models are based on API calls, eg, API sequence, API occurrence, or API frequency, which may change due to the evolution of operating systems. For instance, the list of APIs available in Windows 10 differs from that of Windows 7. It causes the performance degradation of malware detection models when deploying across domains, eg, using a model trained with Windows 7 features on a Windows 10 system. Maintaining multiple models, each for a specific domain, is challenging and costly due to the technical complexity and execution overhead of dynamic analysis. In this paper, we develop a domain adaptation technique named Proteus for malware detection models. Given a small number of feature vectors in both domains (namely source and target domains), we construct a transformation matrix using the least square approximation technique. The transformation matrix enables the conversion of feature vectors among domains. We run experiments with a recent dataset with around 84979 samples validated with VirusTotal. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves a detection accuracy of 91.15%, approximating the upper-bound performance of the model trained in the target domain with the entire dataset. The proposed approach also significantly reduces the overhead of training and maintaining the model of the target domain.

However, they work under the assumption that training data and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. Practical scenarios have varying operating conditions, which results in a domain shift problem that significantly deteriorate the diagnosis performance. Recently domain adaptation has been explored to address the domain shift problem by transferring the knowledge from labeled source domain (eg, source working condition) to unlabeled target domain (eg, target working condition). Yet all the existing methods are working under single source single target (1S1T) settings. Hence, a new model need to be trained for each new target domain. This shows limited scalability in handling multiple working conditions since different models should be trained for different target working conditions, which is clearly not a viable solution in practice. To address this problem, we propose a novel adversarial multiple domain adaptation (AMDA) method for single source multiple target (1SmT) scenario, where the model can generalize to multiple target domains concurrently. Adversarial adaptation is applied to transform the multiple target domains features to be invariant from the single source domain features. This leads to a scalable model with a novel capability of generalizing to multiple target domains. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one self-collected dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art methods consistently.

While various computational methods have been proposed for disease gene prediction, with the recent increasing availability of biological information for genes, it is highly motivated to leverage these valuable data sources and extract useful information for accurately predicting disease genes.Results: We present an integrative framework called N2VKO to predict disease genes. Firstly, we learn the node embeddings from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for genes by adapting the well-known representation learning method node2vec. Secondly, we combine the learned node embeddings with various biological annotations as rich feature representation for genes, and subsequently build binary classification models for disease gene prediction. Finally, as the data for disease gene prediction is usually imbalanced (ie the number of the causative genes for a specific disease is much less than that of its non-causative genes), we further address this serious data imbalance issue by applying oversampling techniques for imbalance data correction to improve the prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed N2VKO significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art methods for disease gene prediction across seven diseases.

To better address the problem, we develop an individual-based simulation model based on the real-life contact data in Singapore. By conducting extensive simulations on the model, we evaluate the impacts of temporal factors, namely the trigger threshold and duration, on the effectiveness of school closure as a mitigation policy. Our observations show that there exists an upper bound of the duration of school closure, further extension beyond which will not bring additional benefits to suppressing the attack rate and peak incidence. We also show that, for school closure with a relatively short duration (< 6 weeks), it is more effective to start it with a relatively longer delay from the first day of infection; if the duration of school closure is long (> 6 weeks), however, it is better to start it as early as reasonable. Our studies reveal the critical importance of timing in school closure, especially in cost-cautious situations.

Existing methods that predict protein complexes from Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) data usually convert the co-complex relationships in TAP data into binary interactions to form a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, the densely connected regions in the PPI network are identified as putative protein complexes. Currently, how to convert the TAP data to accurate PPI data is still inconvenient and challenging but totally unnecessary if we can detect protein complexes directly from TAP data. Additionally, existing methods also ignore to identify the internal substructures of protein complexes (ie, core-attachment structures) from TAP data. In this paper, we propose a method called CACHET that detects protein complexes with Core-AttaCHment structures directly from bipartitE TAP data. Our CACHET models the TAP data as a bipartite graph in which two vertex sets are the baits and the preys respectively, with edges between these two vertex sets representing the bait-prey relationships. CACHET first focuses on detecting high quality protein-complex cores. To minimize the effects of false positive interactions, the bait-prey relationships are indexed with reliability scores. Only the non-redundant, reliable bicliques collected from the TAP bipartite graph are regarded as protein-complex cores. CACHET then obtains protein complexes by including attachment proteins into the cores.

It can be clearly noticed that the haplotype blocks reported in the original work were approximately the same as the regions produced by LD measure r2. Meanwhile, the measure D shows lower sensitivity compared with r2. Under such scenario, we should reconsider the application of LD: these known LD measures may not be applicable to arbitrary data sets and researchers have to make particular modification to the definition of LD or choose the most suitable one from kinds of the measures.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jVn0wDMAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=jVn0wDMAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "title": "Poster Committee Guillaume Bourque (chair) Alan Christoffels Radha Krishna Murthy Karuturi", "authors": ["Olivo Miotto", "Chee Keong Kwoh", "Dong-Yup Lee", "Xiaoli Li", "Sanjay Swarup"], "description": "This year, we received a number of quality poster abstracts with authors coming from a total of 18 different countries.

The main reason for this contradiction is that the FS scores are calculated from DIP data while the positive interactions are from BioGrid data and thus 4,986 positive interactions cannot be assigned with FS scores. After removing these 4,986 positive interactions, FS scores can achieve an AUC 0.997 for the rest 21,862 interactions.

Supervised prediction with bipartite Local Model recently has been shown to be effective for prediction of drug-target interactions. However, this pure \u201clocal\u201d model is unapplicable to new drug or target candidates that currently have no known interactions. In this paper, we extend the existing supervised learning approach\u2013bipartite local model (BLM) by integrating a strategy for handling new drug and target candidates. Based on the assumption that similar drugs and targets have similar interaction profiles, we present a simple neighbor-based training data inferring procedure and integrate it into the frame work of BLM. This globalized BLM called bipartite local model with neighbor-based inferring (BLMN) then has an extended functionality for prediction interactions between new drug candidates and target candidates. Consistent good performance of BLMN has been observed in the experiment for the prediction of interaction between drugs and four important categories of targets. For the Nuclear Receptors dataset, where there are more chances for the presented strategy to be applied, 20% improvement in terms of AUPR has been achieved. This demonstrates the effectiveness of BLMN and its potential in drug-target interaction prediction.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jVn0wDMAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=jVn0wDMAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "title": "Application Comparison and Analysis of Computational Methods for Haplotype Inference Problem", "authors": ["Yan Zhang", "Yiyu Jia", "Chee Keong Kwoh", "Jianjun Liu"], "description": "SNP haplotypes are drawing increasing attention for the study of disease mapping and for tracing population migration events.
