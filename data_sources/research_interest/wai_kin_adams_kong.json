Among biometric technologies,  IrisCode developed by Daugman in 1993 is regarded as a highly accurate approach, being able to support real-time personal identification of large databases. Since 1993, on the top of IrisCode, different coding methods have been proposed for iris and fingerprint identification. In this research, I extend and generalize IrisCode for real-time secure palmprint identification.  PalmCode, the first coding method for palmprint identification developed by me in 2002, directly applied IrisCode to extract phase information of palmprints as features. However, I observe that the PalmCodes from the different palms are similar, having many 45o streaks. Such structural similarities in the PalmCodes of different palms would reduce the individuality of PalmCodes and the performance of palmprint identification systems. To reduce the correlation between PalmCodes, in this thesis, I employ multiple elliptical Gabor filters with different orientations to compute different PalmCodes and merge them to produce a single feature, called Fusion Code. Experimental results demonstrate that Fusion Code performs better than PalmCode. Based on the results of Fusion Code, I further identify that the orientation fields of palmprints are powerful features.

Specifically, to improve unimodal representations, a unimodal refinement module is designed to refine modality-specific learning via iteratively updating the distribution with transformer-based attention layers. Self-quality improvement layers are followed to generate the desired weighted representations progressively. Subsequently, those unimodal representations are projected into a common latent space, regularized by a multimodal Jensen-Shannon divergence loss for better crossmodal refinement. Lastly, a crossmodal refinement module is employed to integrate all information. By hierarchical explorations on unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions, UCRN is highly robust against missing modality and noisy data.

Unlike offline PMS with prior knowledge on the load profiles, real-time PMS is more challenging because of unknown load profiles. Two typical real-time PMS methods are equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) and model prediction control (MPC). However, ECMS can only make instantaneous decisions without the ability to handle large load demand changes, and MPC normally relies on pre-defined input references to guide the optimization. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based method is proposed with a reward function guided by worst-case to minimize the fuel consumption.

Undoubtedly, the rectification network improves the overall text recognition performance. However, in some cases, the rectification network generates unnecessary distortions on images, resulting in incorrect predictions in images that would have otherwise been correct without it. In order to alleviate the unnecessary distortions, the portmanteauing of features is proposed.

In addition, we adopt a mask based statistical measurement to extract texture feature in palmprints, which is characterized by its high convergence of inner-palm similarities and good dispersion of inter-palm discrimination. Furthermore, we apply fuzzy set technology to detect dominant feature, points (\" interest\" points) and lines (\" interest\" lines) to guide matching.
