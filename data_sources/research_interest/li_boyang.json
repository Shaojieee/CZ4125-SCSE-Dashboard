To address this issue, we propose Img2Prompt, a plug-and-play module that provides the prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task disconnections, so that LLMs can perform zero-shot VQA tasks without end-to-end training. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic models to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed question-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform zero-shot VQA tasks.

Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing classification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric learning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper, we bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance Selection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the probability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples. Specifically, we propose a novel method, namely the von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity (vMF-Sim), to calculate this probability by estimating a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution for each data class. Compared with the existing average similarity method (AvgSim), vMF-Sim considers the variance of each class in addition to the average similarity. With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy.
