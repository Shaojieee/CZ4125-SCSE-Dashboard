This paper presents a regularization and aggregation technique for CSP in a small-sample setting (SSS). Conventional CSP is based on a sample-based covariance-matrix estimation. Hence, its performance in EEG classification deteriorates if the number of training samples is small.

Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions.

We found that the representation of place of articulation involved broad networks of brain regions during all phases of speech production: preparation, execution and monitoring.

The activity of populations of single neurons was recorded using multiple electrode arrays implanted in the arm region of primary motor cortex, and decoded to achieve brain control of the platform. We found that free-running brain control of the platform (which was not equipped with any machine intelligence) was fast and accurate, resembling the performance achieved using joystick control.

Interestingly, we found that the response properties of some neurons differed greatly depending on the mode of control (joystick or brain control), suggesting different roles for these neurons in encoding movement intention and movement execution.

Sessions were administered once a week for 4 weeks (1 hour each) to an analogue sample of 50 young adults who reported at least minimal social anxiety symptoms. Participants in both intervention and waitlist control groups completed assessments for social anxiety symptoms at the baseline, week 5, and week 10.Results: Most participants found the intervention acceptable (82.0%, 95% CI 69.0%-91.0%). Seven (14.9%, 95% CI 7.0%-28.0%) participants reported at least one mild adverse event over the course of study. No moderate or serious adverse events were reported. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated greater improvements on all outcome measures of public speaking anxiety from baseline to week 5 as compared to the waitlist control group (Cohen d= 0.61-1.39). Effect size of the difference in mean change on the overall Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale was small (Cohen d= 0.13).Conclusions: Our results indicated that it is worthwhile to proceed to a larger trial for our treatment program. This new medium of administration for exposure therapy may be feasible for treating a subset of social anxiety symptoms. Additional studies are warranted to explore its therapeutic mechanisms.Trial\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2019, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 0]}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sg4vxPoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=sg4vxPoAAAAJ:GZelqfngyKEC", "title": "Spectrum and Phase Adaptive CCA for SSVEP-based Brain Computer Interface", "authors": ["Zhuo Zhang", "Chuanchu Wang", "Kai Keng Ang", "Aung Aung Phyo Wai", "Cuntai Guan"], "description": "Among various brain activity patterns, Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based Brain Computer Inter-face (BCI) requires the least training time while carrying the fastest information transfer rate, making it highly suitable for deploying efficient self-paced BCI systems. In this study, we propose a Spectrum and Phase Adaptive CCA (SPACCA) for subject-and device-specific SSVEP-based BCI. Cross subject heterogeneity of spectrum distribution is taken into consideration to improve the prediction accuracy. We design a library of phase shifting reference signals to accommodate subjective and device-related response time lag. With the flexible reference signal generating approach, the system can be optimized for any specific flickering source, include LED, computer screen and mobile devices.

Poor subjects' performance, known as BCI deficiency, can be due to the subjects' inability to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs). In this work, we investigated the feasibility of improving the BCI performance through neurofeedback (NF) training of the resting state alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz). Thirteen healthy subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental or the control group. The experimental group participated in a MI-BCI session, followed by 12 NF sessions, and a final MI-BCI sessions. The control group performed a MI-BCI session followed by a final MI-BCI session. The results showed that the performances of the experimental group after 12 sessions of NF significantly improved upon the initial MI-BCI performance (p=0.02) but not the control group (p=0.14\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2015, "citations_by_year": {"year": [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, "unknown"], "num_citations": [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 0]}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sg4vxPoAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=sg4vxPoAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "title": "A clinical study of motor imagery BCI performance in stroke by including calibration data from passive movement", "authors": ["Kai Keng Ang", "Cuntai Guan", "Karen Sui Geok Chua", "Kok Soon Phua", "Chuanchu Wang", "Zheng Yang Chin", "Longjiang Zhou", "Ka Yin Tang", "Gopal Joseph Ephraim Joseph", "Christopher Kuah"], "description": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from performing motor imagery are usually used to calibrate a subject-specific model in Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI).
