For such systems, schemes based on incremental relaying have great potential to improve the spectral efficiency by adapting the transmission to time varying channel conditions. The performance enhancement brought about by the presence of relays in such incremental relaying based cooperative systems is dependent on the level of cooperation (based on the relay information quality) and on coordination among the nodes. Coordination is achieved through the use of feedback channels, which incurs significant bandwidth penalty and brings down the spectral efficiency. In order to mitigate this, one can exploit an implicit feedback channel available due to broadcast nature of relay transmissions. Instead of using dedicated feedback channels, the implicit feedback channel is used to measure the relay information quality. Based on this information, the transmitter (source/relay) for the additional coded (redundancy) bits is determined. Such a mechanism enhances the reliability as it ensures the availability of correct information at the destination node for decoding. This paper studies the impact of such an implicit feedback channel by employing powerful codes which exhibit inherent incremental redundancy features, such as rate-compatible codes (rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes and punctured low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes) and rateless codes (Luby Transform (LT) codes).

In order to meet those challenges stated above, future mobile communication systems need to revolve from the current systems in order for it to be able to compete with fixed-line  communication providers. This project focuses on a novel transmission scheme for future wireless communication systems which would reduce the amount of processing complexity and simplify the transceiver structure, while at the same time offering performance improvements to conventional techniques. It is in this context, this project has examined available CDMA transmission methods and proposed a block operation technique for CDMA processing which leads to symboldomain operation instead of chip-domain as in conventional systems\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2008, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=7_AzrLwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=7_AzrLwAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "title": "Overlap cut frequency domain equalization for two-layer spreading CDMA uplink system", "authors": ["Khiam-Boon Png", "Xiaoming Peng", "Farn-Wei Khong", "AS Madhukumar"], "description": "In this paper, we introduced a two-layer spreading CDMA (TLS-CDMA) system with overlap cut frequency domain equalization to seek higher throughput in uplink systems.

We evaluate the throughput performance of a TLS-CDMA system that does not employ CP insertion but instead relies on overlap cut frequency domain equalization (FDE) to mitigate inter block interference.
