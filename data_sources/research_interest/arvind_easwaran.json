To overcome the inefficiencies in resource utilization of such a static scheme, the concept of mixed-criticality real-time scheduling has emerged as a promising solution.

BACKGROUND For safety-critical embedded systems, an increasing trend is to integrate multiple independent functionalities on a single shared computing platform; this trend is evident in industry-driven initiatives and standards such as ARINC653 [1] and IMA and AUTOSAR [2] in automotive. However among all the functionalities in a system, only some functionalities are critical for the correctness of the system and need to be certificated by statutory certification authorities (CAs) and the rest of the functionalities will not influence the safety of the system to the same extent. Under normal conditions, all tasks providing different functionalities will receive enough processing resource. But more critical tasks should be given preference if something abnormal happens in the system (ie when tasks exceed their expected worst-case execution times (WECTs)[3] which in fact is highly unlikely to happen). Such systems comprised of tasks of different criticalities are called mixed-criticality (MC) systems.

Device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities can be exploited to enable geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing excess demand to allow movement of devices.

To duly ensure the performance of components, a software-based resilience manager is a flexible choice to detect and recover from faults quickly. However, a single resilience manager, placed at the centre of the system to deal with every fault, suffers from decision-making overburden; and therefore, is out of the question for distributed large-scale CPS. On the other hand, prompt detection of failures and efficient recovery from them are challenging for decentralised resilience managers. In this regard, we present a novel resilience management framework that utilises the concept of management hierarchy.

An important challenge in designing MCS is to handle uncertainties in the execution behaviour such as a budget overrun of a software element (or task) in a safe and effective manner. For this purpose, functional safety standards such as ISO 26262 [1] specify a set of rules and rigorous process which necessitate the system design to incorporate sufficient mechanisms to prevent the propagation of faults from tasks certified to lower criticality level to tasks certified to higher criticality level. A majority of the existing MCS task models (reviewed in [2]) consider criticality to denote the relative importance of a task and use it to achieve graceful degradation of the system either by suspending or degrading tasks with relatively lower criticality level than the overloading task. As pointed out in [3], notion of criticality as the relative importance of a task may be appropriate only for dual-criticality MCS models (where a task can be either high critical or low critical). For instance, it has been observed that in a system with 4 criticality levels, to handle budget overrun of any task at criticality level 4 (highest), degradation of tasks with criticality level 3 may not be acceptable. As stated in [4], the notion of criticality, relative importance and degradation of a functionality in an MCS should be loosely coupled entities. To achieve this, we consider a context-aware degradation strategy with the following\u00a0\u2026", "publication_year": 2019, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=B_ouhTgAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=B_ouhTgAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "title": "Management for Cyber-Physical Systems", "authors": ["Mohammad Shihabul Haque", "Daniel Jun Xian Ng", "Arvind Easwaran"], "description": "Cyber-physical Systems SG tisfy User requirements through ClOSe COllCbOrGflOn GmOng physicGl Gnd Cyber COmponents.

DaCO delivers these improvements with a custom instruction datapath that exploits the raw parallelism exposed by the dataflow triggering rule - instructions execute asynchronously as soon as their operands are available. However, this simple triggering logic can expose large amounts of irregular instruction-level parallelism that can be hard to manage. This thesis addresses this challenge in three steps: (1) design of a lightweight scheduling circuit inside each DaCO soft-processor that enables large- scale out-of-order instruction execution at runtime, (2) design of a priority-aware communication framework that delivers improved quality of service to critical communication packets, and (3) compiler support that optimizes the dataflow graph structure for improved runtime execution. DaCO is optimized for the Arria 10 AX115S (20nm SoC) FPGA board in order to take advantage of the hard on-chip floating-point DSP blocks. Overall, when benchmarked with sparse-matrix vector multiply kernels, DaCO improves throughput performance by up to 2.4x over existing in-order dataflow overlays, and delivers a peak operational throughput of up to 38 MFLOPs/processor, or a peak total throughput of 3.5 GFLOPs/sec.

The online-tuned controller is fully-automatic in the sense that it can automatically deal with intra- and inter-patient variabilities and compensate for unannounced meal disturbances without any prior knowledge of patient parameters, patient specific characteristics or patient specific input\u2013output data. A data driven Volterra model of patients is used to design IMC algorithms. For online-tuned controller, the Volterra kernels of the model are computed online by recursive least squares algorithm. The IMC algorithms are evaluated using different scenarios in the UVA/Padova metabolic simulator for validation, comparison with a fully-automatic zone model predictive controller and robustness analysis. Unlike offline-tuned IMC and semi-automated IMC, the online-tuned IMC in the AP system performs satisfactorily for every patient condition without patients\u2019 intervention. Experimental results show that the online-tuned IMC compensates unannounced meal disturbances with low frequency of hypoglycemic events and most importantly, with low insulin infusion even with variations in insulin sensitivity, in the presence of irregular amounts of meal disturbances at random times, and in the presence of very high noise levels in the sensors and actuators.

We show that under miscellaneous adversarial attacks, SVD based input defense method improves the accuracy of robust ImageNet models on the RobustBench leaderboard by 4-6%, the best among existing input defense methods in comparison.", "publication_year": null, "citations_by_year": {"year": [], "num_citations": []}, "topic": null, "agg_topic": null, "final_topic": null}, {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=B_ouhTgAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=B_ouhTgAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "title": "Gabriel Parmer Roberto Passerone Nuno Pereira Linh Thi Xuan Phan", "authors": ["Luca Abeni", "Masud Ahmed", "Bader Al-Ahmad", "Luis Almeida", "Mikael \u00c5sberg", "Neil Audsley", "Philip Axer", "Paulo Baltarejo Sousa", "Mario Bambagini", "Laura Barros Bastante", "Tseesuren Batsuuri", "Moris Behnam", "Sven Buente", "Julie Chambon", "Bekim Cilku", "Rodrigo Coehlo", "Dakshina Dasari", "Farhana Dewan", "Robert Diemer", "Benedikt Dietrich", "Bjoern Doebel", "Arvind Easwaran", "Christian El Salloum", "Benjamin Engel", "Dario Faggioli", "Daniele Fontanelli", "Torsten Frenzel", "Shelby Funk", "Joe Gaudet", "Martin Geier", "Jo\u00ebl Goossens", "Raphael Guerra", "Mike Holenderski", "Benedikt Huber", "Giancarlo Iannizzotto", "Matthias Ivers", "Petr Jurcik", "Roland Kammerer", "Susanne Kandl", "Ugur Keskin", "Anis Koubaa", "Jinkyu Lee", "Minsub Lee", "Benjamin Lesage", "Xue Liu", "Yue Lu", "Anwar Mamat", "Ricardo Marau", "Jos\u00e9 Marinho", "Alejandro Masrur", "Anand Meher", "Meha Mehta", "Patrick Meumeu Yomsi", "Pierre Michaud", "Sibin Mohan", "Theepan Moorthy", "Mircea Negrean", "Vincent N\u00e9lis", "Farhang Nemati", "Luis Nogueira", "Daniel Medina Ortega", "Javier Orozco", "Jos\u00e9 Carlos Palencia", "Wolfgang Puffitsch", "Paul Regnier", "Michael Roitzsch", "Keivan Ronasi", "Jonas Rox", "Luca Santinelli", "Abhik Sarkar", "Martin Sch\u00e4fer", "Simon Schliecker", "Reinhard Schneider", "Stefan Schorr", "Maurice Sebastian", "Ramon Serna", "Michal Sojka", "Ondrej Spinka", "Julian Stecklina", "Udo Steinberg", "Premysl Sucha", "Maliha Sultana", "Emanuele Toscano", "Jiri Trdlicka", "Luca Valcarenghi", "Cuong Viet", "Shaohui Wang", "Yunbo Wang", "Armin Wasicek", "Libor Waszniowski", "Carsten Weinhold", "Jack Whitham"], "description": "list-reviewer Toggle navigation IEEE Computer Society Digital Library Jobs Tech News \nResource Center Press Room Advertising About Us IEEE IEEE Computer Society IEEE \nComputer Society Digital Library My Subscriptions Magazines Journals Conference Proceedings \nInstitutional Subscriptions IEEE IEEE Computer Society More Jobs Tech News Resource \nCenter Press Room Advertising About Us Cart All Advanced Search Conference Cover Image \nDownload 1.Home 2.Proceedings 3.ecrts 2010 list-reviewer 2010, pp. xi-xi, DOI Bookmark: \n10.1109/ECRTS.2010.6 Keywords Authors Abstract The conference offers a note of thanks and \nlists its reviewers.

We welcome you in the Mediterranean city of Valencia to spend an exciting time for science and also social gathering around the conference themes.Since its origin back in 1998, ISORC addresses the most interesting topics around real-time applications, object-oriented and component technology for distributed systems, and distribution middleware design. The conference has evolved over the years to address the many emerging challenges that new applications and systems bring to the scientific and technological arena. This event requires the involvement of a number of people that we wish to thank individually. In the first place, we warmly thank the PC chairs, Aniruddha Gokhale, Weichen Liu, and Mathias Pacher for their effort and time in putting together an outstanding pool of reviewers and for handling the review process of the submitted contributions to select the final set of papers that will be presented. Also, we want to thank the Poster/Demo chairs, Prof. Luis Lino Ferreira and Di Liu, who have organized a track on posters and demos for the first time in ISORC. Thanks also to this years\u2019 publicity chairs, Tommaso Cucinotta and Zhenkai Zhang (the latter also acting as Web chair) for their involvement in reaching out to the scientific and technological community.
