Recently, matrix completion (MC) has been developed to deal with multi-label classification tasks.

However, current MC-based multi-label image classification methods only consider data represented by a single-view feature, therefore, do not precisely characterize images that contain several semantic concepts. An intuitive way to utilize multiple features taken from different views is to concatenate the different features into a long vector; however, this concatenation is prone to over-fitting and leads to high time complexity in MC-based image classification. Therefore, we present a novel multi-view learning model for MC-based image classification, called low-rank multi-view matrix completion (lrMMC), which first seeks a low-dimensional common representation of all views by utilizing the proposed low-rank multi-view learning (lrMVL) algorithm. In lrMVL, the common subspace is constrained to be low rank so that it is suitable for MC. In addition, combination weights are learned to explore complementarity between different views. An efficient solver based on fixed-point continuation (FPC) is developed for optimization, and the learned low-rank representation is then incorporated into MC-based image classification.

First, we integrate ring-based allreduce, mixed-precision training, and computation/communication overlap into GradientFlow.

To address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates clients' models with the aggregated global model. It preserves data privacy as each party only has access to its raw data.

Recent works further implement federated learning with SSL to learn from rapidly growing decentralized unlabeled images (e.g., from cameras and phones), often resulted from privacy constraints. Extensive attention has been paid to SSL approaches based on Siamese networks. However, such an effort has not yet revealed deep insights into various fundamental building blocks for the federated self-supervised learning (FedSSL) architecture. We aim to fill in this gap via in-depth empirical study and propose a new method to tackle the non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data problem of decentralized data. Firstly, we introduce a generalized FedSSL framework that embraces existing SSL methods based on Siamese networks and presents flexibility catering to future methods. In this framework, a server coordinates multiple clients to conduct SSL training and periodically updates local models of clients with the aggregated global model. Using the framework, our study uncovers unique insights of FedSSL: 1) stop-gradient operation, previously reported to be essential, is not always necessary in FedSSL; 2) retaining local knowledge of clients in FedSSL is particularly beneficial for non-IID data. Inspired by the insights, we then propose a new approach for model update, Federated Divergence-aware Exponential Moving Average update (FedEMA). FedEMA updates local models of clients adaptively using EMA of the global model, where the decay rate is dynamically measured by model divergence.

Current TML tools usually assume that different domains exploit the same feature representation, and thus are not applicable to tasks where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches handle heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains. The learned transformation can be used to derive a metric, but these approaches are mostly limited by their capability of only handling two domains. This motivates the proposed heterogeneous multi-task metric learning (HMTML) framework for handling multiple domains by combining side information and unlabeled data. Specifically, HMTML learns the metrics for all different domains simultaneously by maximizing their high-order correlation (parameterized by feature covariance of unlabeled data) in a common subspace, which is induced by the transformations derived from the metrics.

Hence, they are not suitable for the applications, in which the data are from heterogeneous domains (feature spaces, modalities and even semantics).

Specifically, the system aims to achieve two goals: 1) Provide the optimal analytics results under the constraints of lower bandwidth usage and shorter round-trip time (RTT) by judiciously managing the computational and bandwidth resources deployed in the client, fog, and cloud environment. 2) Free developers from tedious administration and operation tasks, including DNN deployment, cloud and fog's resource management.

VPaaS adopts serverless computing to enable developers to build a video analytics pipeline by simply programming a set of functions (e.g., model inference), which are then orchestrated to process videos through carefully designed modules. To save bandwidth and reduce RTT, VPaaS provides a new video streaming protocol that only sends low-quality video to the cloud. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs deployed at the cloud can identify regions of video frames that need further processing at the fog ends.

Existing heterogeneous transfer learning (including multi-task learning) approaches handle multiple heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains, but they ignore the high-order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all domains.

A connection between all domains is built by using the transformations to project the pre-learned predictive structures of different domains into a common subspace, and minimizing their divergence in the subspace.

FedFR improves the performance in the target domain by iteratively aggregating knowledge from the source domain through federated learning. It protects data privacy by transferring models instead of raw data between domains. Besides, we propose a new domain constraint loss (DCL) to regularize source domain training. DCL suppresses the data volume dominance of the source domain. We also enhance a hierarchical clustering algorithm to predict pseudo labels for the unlabeled target domain accurately. To this end, FedFR forms an end-to-end training pipeline: (1) pre-train in the source domain; (2) predict pseudo labels by clustering in the target domain; (3) conduct domain-constrained federated learning across two domains. Extensive experiments and analysis on two newly constructed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FedFR. It outperforms the baseline and classic methods in the target domain by over 4% on the more realistic benchmark.

In the meanwhile, Differential Privacy (DP) emerges as a promising countermeasure to defend against gradient leakage attacks. However, the adoption of DP by clients in FL may significantly jeopardize the model accuracy. It is still an open problem to understand the practicality of DP from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the number of conducted iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally derive the convergence rate with DP noises in FL. Then, we theoretically derive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the number of global iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of local iterations (LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By further substituting the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms into the derived convergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg with the Laplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively prohibited by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can converge to a constant number finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI.

This replacement of electronic switching with optical switching at intermediate nodes, however, presents new challenges for fault detection and localization in reconfigurable all-optical networks. Presently, fault detection and localization techniques, as implemented in SONET/G.709 networks, rely on electronic processing of parity checks at intermediate nodes. If similar techniques are adapted to all-optical reconfigurable networks, optical signals need to be tapped out at intermediate nodes for parity checks. This additional electronic processing would break the all-optical transparency paradigm and thus significantly diminish the cost advantages of all-optical networks. In this thesis, we propose new fault-diagnosis approaches specifically tailored to all-optical networks, with an objective of keeping the diagnostic capital expenditure and the diagnostic operation effort low. Instead of the aforementioned passive monitoring paradigm based on parity checks, we propose a proactive lightpath probing paradigm: optical probing signals are sent along a set of lightpaths in the network, and network state (i.e., failure pattern) is then inferred from testing results of this set of end-to-end lightpath measurements.

Specifically, we design a two-stream architecture, which mainly consists of a support-centered stream and query-centered stream, to learn the optimal class prototypes.

Naturally, a source station can allocate the packets to a set of vehicles, which serve as relays to opportunistically deliver these packets to the destination station while performing their own tasks. In this paper, we show that, with packet-level erasure coding (e.g., fountain codes), only a few redundant packets are required to achieve a significant reduction in file delay.

In BAS, each road buffers the data packets with multiple duplicates propagation in order to provide more opportunities for packet switching at intersections. Different from conventional protocols in VANETs, the propagation of duplicates in BAS is bidirectional along the routing path. Moreover, BAS's cost is much lower than other flooding-based protocols due to its spatio-temporally controlled duplicates propagation. Different from recent researches, BAS can deliver packets not only to a stationary node, but also to the stationary or mobile nodes in a specified area.

This task is to localize the objects in the images given only the image-level supervision. Recently, dividing WSOL into two parts (class-agnostic object localization and object classification) has become the state-of-the-art pipeline for this task. However, existing solutions under this pipeline usually suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they are not flexible since they can only localize one object for each image due to the adopted single-class regression (SCR) for localization; 2) the generated pseudo bounding boxes may be noisy, but the negative impact of such noise is not well addressed. To remedy these drawbacks, we first propose to replace SCR with a binary-class detector (BCD) for localizing multiple objects, where the detector is trained by discriminating the foreground and background.

Quite a lot of efforts have been made to develop various algorithms and applications.

Methods In this paper, we propose to address this issue by answering two questions: 1. How does deep learning benefit blockchain? 2. How does blockchain benefit deep learning? Results For the former, we systematically decompose the blockchain system into five layers, including a network layer, a consensus layer, a data model layer, an execution layer, and an application layer, from bottom to top. In each layer, we introduce the major challenge, and the corresponding deep learning-based approach. For the latter, we discuss the benefits of blockchain, including anonymity, decentralization, security and immutability, which can be utilized to protect data privacy and coordinate distributed control in deep learning applications.

In existing distributed hash table (DHT) based metadata management systems, the lookup service could be a performance bottleneck due to its significant CPU overhead. Our investigations showed that the lookup service could reduce system throughput by up to 70%, and increase system latency by a factor of up to 8 compared to ideal scenarios. In this paper, we present MetaFlow, a scalable metadata lookup service utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) techniques to distribute lookup workload over network components. MetaFlow tackles the lookup bottleneck problem by leveraging B-tree, which is constructed over the physical topology, to manage flow tables for SDN-enabled switches. Therefore, metadata requests can be forwarded to appropriate servers using only switches. Extensive performance evaluations in both simulations and testbed showed that MetaFlow increases system throughput by a factor of up to 3.2, and reduce system latency by a factor of up to 5 compared to DHT-based systems.

While several out-of-core graph processing systems and computation models have been proposed, the high disk I/O overhead could significantly reduce performance in many practical cases. In this paper, we propose GraphMP to tackle big graph analytics on a single machine. GraphMP achieves low disk I/O overhead with three techniques. First, we design a vertex-centric sliding window (VSW) computation model to avoid reading and writing vertices on disk. Second, we propose a selective scheduling method to skip loading and processing unnecessary edge shards on disk. Third, we use a compressed edge cache mechanism to fully utilize the available memory of a machine to reduce the amount of disk accesses for edges. Extensive evaluations have shown that GraphMP could outperform existing single-machine out-of-core systems such as GraphChi, X-Stream and GridGraph by up to 30, and can be as highly competitive as distributed graph engines like Pregel+, PowerGraph and Chaos."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=byeygOkAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=byeygOkAAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC": {"external_link": "https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/context/sis_research/article/5769/viewcontent/1704.06738.pdf", "authors": ["Peng SUN", "Yonggang WEN", "Nguyen Binh Duong TA", "Shengen YAN"], "journal": "Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP), May", "pages": "29-31", "description": "Many cluster management systems (CMSs) have been proposed to share a single cluster with multiple distributed computing systems. However, none of the existing approaches can handle distributed machine learning (ML) workloads given the following criteria: high resource utilization, fair resource allocation and low sharing overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a new CMS named Dorm, incorporating a dynamicallypartitioned cluster management mechanism and an utilizationfairness optimizer. Specifically, Dorm uses the container-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one application per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at application runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for resources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead.

Data plays an important part in smart city applications. Deployment of sensors, actuators, and smart objects on a city-scale generates a huge amount of data in real-time. With such diverse and large volume of the collected data for smart cities, ML comes in to perform data analytics for system modeling, trend prediction, and intelligence generation [1].ML provides a wide spectrum of algorithms and technologies, each having its unique design philosophy and analysis mechanism.

We propose a family of failure localization algorithms that exploit the unique properties of all-optical networks. Optical probe signals are sequentially sent along a set of designed lightpaths and the network state is inferred from the result of this set of end-to-end measurements. The design objective is to minimize the diagnosis effort (eg, the average number of probes) to locate failures.By establishing a mathematical equivalence between the fault diagnosis problem and the source coding problem in Information Theory, we obtain a tight lower bound for the minimum average number of probes per edge (of the network modeled as a graph) as Hb (p), the entropy of the individual edges. Using the rich set of results from coding theory to solve the fault diagnosis problem, we show that the \u20182m-splitting\u2019probing scheme is optimum for the special case of single failure over a linear network. We then develop a class of near-optimum run-length probing schemes that have low computation complexity. Analytical and numerical results suggest that the average number of probes per edge for the run-length probing scheme is uniformly bounded above by (1+ \u03b5) Hb (p), and converges to the entropy lower bound as the failure probability decreases. From an information theoretic perspective, we show that the run-length probing scheme outperforms the greedy probing scheme of the same computational complexity.
