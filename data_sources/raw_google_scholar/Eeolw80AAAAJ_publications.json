An optimal strategy for NZBC coding is then derived and experimental results are given for a comparison of the new scheme with uniform bit allocation.Introduction: The FGS video coding technique [1] has been proposed as a new flexible and simple framework for scalable coding, whose major difference from conventional SNR scalability is the adoption of BP coding for discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients instead of the conventional quantization of DCT coefficients. When we deliver the FGS-coded bitstreams through a bandwidth-constrained environment, there is a need to regulate the bitstream and accordingly perform an efficient bit allocation. Recent methods [2, 3] on bit allocation for FGS coding either employ the classical RD model used in general transform coders to express the coding behaviors of FGS layer approximately, or extract the RD relationship from experimental video data; but do not give an analytic RD model that combines the characteristics of FGS coding. In this letter, we will propose a new bit allocation scheme for FGS coding after analyzing the relationship of RD behaviors with respect to NZBC. We observe that there is a linear relationship between the output rate and the percentage of encoded NZBC in each BP, and the distortion (D) is directly determined by the coded NZBC.

Taking the animal classes in Figure 1 as an example, human-beings can easily differentiate the four classes. However, computers are not able to identify the difference in the same way. The varied background environment of the same Arctic Fox class can introduce great variance in global image features, while the subtle fur color difference between Arctic Fox and Fennec Fox makes it difficult to classify from local image features. It is also hard to identify the different distribution of colors over Maned Wolf or Dhole from spatial features. On the other hand, cues from the text on the corresponding web page could make a substantial contribution to the performance of image classification. For example, even a single keyword Kashmir could indicate the Dhole class, as Kashmir is the habitat of Dhole. Similar useful relationships which help to narrow down the final concepts include name, diet, and distribution relationships. Therefore, an effective way is to combine the images features with the text information for image retrieval, where ontology is utilized for this purpose. Ontology, which clearly defines concepts and their relationships in a domain, has been widely used in many information retrieval fields, including document indexing, ie, extracting semantic contents from a set of text document, image retrieval and classification, ie, using concepts either from image features or surrounding text for content representation, and video retrieval, ie, using text in video captions for semantic concept detection.

First, the 3D video signal (xyt) is transformed into the frequency domain by 3D Fourier transform. After applying 3D Fourier transform on the video signal, we derive that the non-zeros coefficients should lie on one plane (coplanarity) under the condition that the video motion is translational. We call this plane video motion plane. Furthermore, the normal of the video motion plane gives the velocity of the motion. Therefore, the video motion estimation problem turns out to be a plane fitting problem in the 3D frequency domain with the nonzero Fourier coefficients. Robust M-estimator is used to fit the plane and give the estimated velocity. Experimental results on both synthetic and real video sequences illustrate robustness against noise and good performance of the proposed approach. keywords"}}
