On the other hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital service providers to improve operational productivity and customer satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users' personal data, which could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a serious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data leaving their stored location. However, depending on the nature of the digital services, data captured at different locations may carry different significance to the business operation, hence a weighted aggregation will be highly desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. Furthermore, to prevent leakage of user data from the aggregated gradients, cryptographic mechanisms are needed to allow secure aggregation of FL. In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhanced FL scheme for supporting secure weighted aggregation.

It is more intuitive and much easier to understand human behaviors with less redundancy in concept by exploring the behavior interior dimensions, compared with directly using behavior exteriors. However, they usually approach from a unidimensional perspective with a lack of a sense of interrelatedness. Thus, integrating multiple behavior dimensions together into some numerical measures to form a more comprehensive view for subsequent prediction processes becomes a pivotal issue.

All these adversarial examples change pixels inside target objects to carry out attacks but only some of them are suitable for physical attacks. According to the best knowledge of the authors, no published work successfully attacks object detector without changing pixels inside the target object. In an unpublished work, the authors designed an adversarial border which tightly surrounds target object and successfully misleads Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3 digitally and physically. Adversarial border does not change pixels inside target object but makes it look weird. In this paper, a new adversarial example named adversarial signboard, which looks like a signboard, is proposed. By putting it below a target object, it can mislead the state-of-the-art object detectors. Using stop sign as a target object, adversarial signboard is evaluated on 48 videos with totally 5416 frames. The experimental results show that adversarial signboard derived from Faster R-CNN with ResNet-101 as a backbone network can mislead Faster R-CNN with a different backbone network, Mask R-CNN, YOLOv3 and R-FCN digitally and physically.", "total_citations": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4385335/", "authors": ["Haiyong Chen", "Hongwei Sun", "Kwok-Yan Lam"], "publication_date": "2007/10/14", "conference": "The International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems, and Technologies (SECUREWARE 2007)", "pages": "211-215", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "Reliably and fast matching fingerprints is still a challenging problem in a fingerprint verification system.

Using the constructed regions, the proposed algorithm can find matched minutiae more rapidly via regional matching. Since each minutia's region is formed from only a small area of the fingerprint, our algorithm is more tolerant to non-linear distortion when compared to global matching approaches.

Experiments on Twitter data show that the semantic model outperforms the transactional model, if the exterior pattern is less directly observable (ie hashtag cascade). When it becomes more directly observable (ie retweet and url cascades), the semantic method yet delivers approximate accuracy (ie url cascade) or even worse accuracy (ie retweet cascade).

The design of content caching is based on the principles that popular contents are cached at appropriate network edges in order to reduce transmission delay and avoid backhaul bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a cooperative caching replacement and efficiency optimization scheme for IP-based wireless networks. Wireless edges are designed to establish a one-hop scope of caching information table for caching replacement in cases when there is not enough cache resource available within its own space. During the course, after receiving the caching request, every caching node should determine the weight of the required contents and provide a response according to the availability of its own caching space. Furthermore, to increase the caching efficiency from a practical perspective, we introduce the concept of quality of user experience (QoE) and try to properly allocate the cache resource of the whole networks to better satisfy user demands. Different caching allocation strategies are devised to be adopted to enhance user QoE in various circumstances.

Through this transformation, lots of personal data are captured which individuals have no ownership or control over, threatening their privacy. It is therefore necessary for the data owners to have control over the ownership, custody and utilization of their data and to protect one's digital assets and identity through proper data governance, cybersecurity control and privacy protection. This results in the notions of data sovereignty and digital sovereignty - two conceptually related terms, but different focuses. This paper first explains these two concepts in terms of their guiding principles, laws and regulations requirements, and analyse and discuss the technical challenges of implementing these requirements.

For example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between 3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to 8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing of ISTCN.

Frequency estimation is a widely used statistical tool which could potentially conflict with the relevant privacy regulations. Privacy preserving analytic methods based on differential privacy have been proposed, which either require a large user base or a trusted server; hence may give big companies an unfair advantage while handicapping smaller organizations in their growth opportunity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fair privacy-preserving sampling-based frequency estimation method and provides a relation between its privacy guarantee, output accuracy, and number of participants. We designed decentralized privacy-preserving aggregation mechanisms using multi-party computation technique and established that, for a limited number of participants and a fixed privacy level, our mechanisms perform better than those that are based on traditional perturbation methods; hence, provide smaller companies a fair growth opportunity. We further propose an architectural model to support weighted aggregation in order to achieve higher accuracy estimate to cater for users with different privacy requirements.

It is therefore desirable to devise techniques that can identify useful patterns with arbitrary window sizes. Attempts to this problem are challenging, however, because it requires a highly efficient searching in a substantially bigger solution space.

However, data privacy remains a significant concern. Federated Learning (FL) encourages data sharing in ML without requiring data to leave users' devices but imposes heavy computation and communications overheads on mobile devices. Hierarchical FL (HFL) alleviates this problem by performing partial model aggregation at edge servers. HFL can effectively reduce energy consumption and latency through effective resource allocation and appropriate user assignment. Nevertheless, resource allocation in HFL involves optimizing multiple variables, and the objective function should consider both energy consumption and latency, making the development of resource allocation algorithms very complicated. Moreover, it is challenging to perform user assignment, which is a combinatorial optimization problem in a large search space. This article proposes a spectrum resource optimization algorithm (SROA) and a two-stage iterative algorithm (TSIA) for HFL. Given an arbitrary user assignment pattern, SROA optimizes CPU frequency, transmit power, and bandwidth to minimize system cost. TSIA aims to find a user assignment pattern that considerably reduces the total system cost.

To achieve this, they either use shallow linear transformations or deep convolutional modules. However, the linear transformations suffer from the expressiveness issue while the deep convolutional modules introduce unnecessary inductive bias, which could potentially degrade the model performance. Thus, we propose a novel Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model (PatReFormer) for KGC. PatReFormer first segments the embedding into a sequence of patches and then employs cross-attention modules to allow bi-directional embedding feature interaction between the entities and relations, leading to a better understanding of the underlying KG. We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n.

Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that requires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network users.

In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of dishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum sharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading process so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized access by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use of blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and traceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading reputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of heterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support users with limited computing power.

One major deficiency of threshold closure is that a threshold closure generated from the corresponding access structure is not minimal in size, thus the collection of threshold schemes is not optimized for\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC": {"external_link": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VLCoCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA259&dq=info:yqKfT4og7n0J:scholar.google.com&ots=B4ewP-LuY9&sig=_qsmKnpKbQv_ONQgVStOaMLuUHo", "authors": ["Kwok-yan Lam", "Dieter Gollmann"], "publication_date": "2006/4/10", "journal": "Computer Security-ESORICS 92: Second European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, Toulouse, France, November 23-25, 1992.

Furthermore, the fastest software implementation reported to date is also based on curves defined over such fields. In this paper, we show that GF (2^ n) is not the most suitable field for software implementation. We identified a family of finite fields of the form GF (2^ ns), where 2^ ns is a large prime and s is a random single precision integer, which is more suitable for software implementation of elliptic curve cryptosystems.

The theoretical XOR gate delay of the resulting multipliers is reduced significantly. For example, it is reduced by about 33% and 25% for n= 2t and n= 3t (t> 1), respectively.

Non-repudiation services protect the transacting parties against any false denial that a particular event or action has taken place, in which evidence will be generated, collected and maintained to enable the settlement of disputes. Several fair non-repudiation protocols have been proposed, which support non-repudiation of origin and non-repudiation of receipt while neither the originator nor the recipient can gain an advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving during a transaction. However, a critical issue on how to maintain the validity of non-repudiation evidence e ciently during and after a transaction was not considered. This paper uses the idea of evidence chaining to address such a problem."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC": {"external_link": "https://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=42753", "authors": ["Kwok Yan Lam", "Eiji Okamoto", "Chaoping Xing"], "journal": "Lecture notes in computer science", "publisher": "Springer", "description": "Advances in cryptology - ASIACRYPT'99 (Singapore, 14-18 November 1999) CNRS Inist \nPascal-Francis CNRS Pascal and Francis Bibliographic Databases Simple search Advanced \nsearch Search by classification Search by vocabulary My Account Home > Search results Help \nExport Export Selection : Selected items (1) Format : Permanent link CopyPermanent link Copy \nhttp://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=42753 Advances \nin cryptology - ASIACRYPT'99 (Singapore, 14-18 November 1999) Author Kwok Yan Lam \n(Editor) ; Okamoto, Eiji (Editor) ; Chaoping Xing (Editor) Conference name International \nconference on the theory and application of cryptology and information security (Singapore \n1999-11-14) Source Lecture notes in computer science. 1999 ; XI, 414 p ; Illustration ; \nref : dissem ISSN 0302-9743 ISBN 3-540-66666-4 Scientific domain Computer science; \u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC": {"external_link": "https://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=16290996", "authors": ["Chi-Hung Chi", "Kwok-Yan Lam"], "journal": "Lecture notes in computer science", "publisher": "Springer", "description": "Content computing (ZhenJiang, JiangSu, 15-17 November 2004) CNRS Inist Pascal-Francis \nCNRS Pascal and Francis Bibliographic Databases Simple search Advanced search Search by \nclassification Search by vocabulary My Account Home > Search results Help Export Export \nSelection : Selected items (1) Format : Permanent link CopyPermanent link Copy \nhttp://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=16290996 Content \ncomputing (ZhenJiang, JiangSu, 15-17 November 2004) Author Chi, Chi-Hung (Editor) ; Lam, \nKwok-Yan (Editor) Conference name AWCC 2004 : advanced workshop on content computing \n(JianSu 2004-11-15) Source Lecture notes in computer science. 2004 ; XII, 510 p ; Illustration ; \nref : dissem ISSN 0302-9743 ISBN 3-540-23898-0 Scientific domain Computer science \nPublisher Springer, Berlin Publication country Germany Document type Conference Proceedings \u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=NDMIYKsAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=NDMIYKsAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC": {"external_link": "https://geocities.datacellar.net/amwibowo/resource/hips.pdf", "authors": ["Arrianto Mukti Wibowo", "Kwok Yan Lam", "Gary SH Tan"], "description": "There has been a lot of off-line electronic cash systems proposed so far, which are based on the \u2018digital coins\u2019 paradigm. Digital coins are anonymous, but not without drawbacks. Among the drawbacks are: large database requirement to record spent coins, customers must \u2018carry\u2019the coins prior payments, time consuming client side processing at payment (especially with multiple coins), and coin divisibility problems. Other proposals suggested account-based payment systems that are based on wire fund transfer, therefore the customers do not need to carry the coins nor divide coins. However, they only provide limited (or easily compromised) anonymity. In this paper we propose a novel solution, which we baptize \u2018hybrid payment system\u2019(HiPS). As its name implies, it is a hybrid of digital coin system and account-based payment system, and has the best features of both systems. Moreover, a judge can revoke complete anonymity in HiPS whenever required.(version: 9 June 2000)"}}
