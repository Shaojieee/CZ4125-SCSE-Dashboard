Firstly, an active inference module based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is established to predict the primary content, in which the semantic similarity and the structural dissimilarity (i.e., semantic consistency and structural completeness) are both considered during the optimization. Then, the image quality is measured on the basis of its primary content. Generally, the image quality is highly related to three aspects, i.e., the scene information (content\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2021": 9, "2022": 23, "2023": 25}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=D_S41X4AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=D_S41X4AAAAJ:Dh4RK7yvr34C": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3091478.3091522", "authors": ["Sharath Chandra Guntuku", "Weisi Lin", "Jordan Carpenter", "Wee Keong Ng", "Lyle H Ungar", "Daniel Preo\u0163iuc-Pietro"], "publication_date": "2017/6/25", "book": "Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on web science conference", "pages": "223-227", "description": "Interacting with images through social media has become widespread due to ubiquitous Internet access and multimedia enabled devices.

To mitigate these threats, recent studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability, meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with existing ones.

In this paper, we propose the use of singular vectors out of Singular Value Decomposition as effective structuring elements in images and use them to quantify the loss in structural information in images. The scalability of the proposed metric has been also explored since singular vectors are ordered according to their visual significance.

To this end, we first implement a straightforward method, i.e., multiplicative-perturbation-based exposure attack, and reveal the big challenges of this new task. Then, to make the adversarial image naturalness, we propose the adversarial bracketed exposure fusion that regards the exposure attack as an element-wise bracketed exposure fusion problem in the Laplacian-pyramid space. Moreover, to realize high transferability, we further propose the convolutional bracketed exposure fusion where the element-wise multiplicative operation is extended to the convolution. We validate our method on the real public DR dataset with the advanced DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, showing our method can achieve high image quality and success rate of the transfer attack.

Then, we extract three groups of quality-related features, including: 1) geometry density features; 2) color naturalness features; 3) angular consistency features. Both the cognitive peculiarities of the human brain and naturalness regularity are involved in the designed quality-aware features that can capture the most vital aspects of distorted 3D point clouds.

To evaluate the proposed method, a subjective assessment has been performed by clinical AS-OCT experts, who graded the quality of AS-OCT images on a scale of good, fair, and poor\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=D_S41X4AAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=D_S41X4AAAAJ:tswL-GKFg8UC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7498940/", "authors": ["Sharath Chandra Guntuku", "Sujoy Roy", "Weisi Lin", "Kelvin Ng", "Ng Wee Keong", "Vinit Jakhetiya"], "publication_date": "2016/6/6", "conference": "2016 Eighth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)", "pages": "1-6", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "Recommending content to users involves understanding a) what to present and b) how to present them, so as to increase quality of experience (QoE) and thereby, content consumption.

Exploiting both the low-rank nature of real-world events and the redundancy in sensory data, DECA combines matrix completion with a fine-tuned compressed sensing technique to conduct a dual-level reconstruction process.

Most of the existing VQA methods usually isolate each moment within the video (i.e., it neglects the sequential nature), leading to a large gap from the subjective perception. Recent research on neuroscience suggests a serially dependent perception (SDP) mechanism in the human visual system (HVS). Namely, the HVS tends to incorporate the recent past visual experience to predict the present perception. Inspired by the SDP, we suggest that the HVS prefers stable and continuous degradations in videos due to their predictability, and exhibits less tolerance to interrupted and unpredictable disturbances.

However, they have a major drawback that the generated JND is assessed in the real-world signal domain instead of in the perceptual domain in the human brain. There is an obvious difference when JND is assessed in such two domains since the visual signal in the real world is encoded before it is delivered into the brain with the human visual system (HVS). Hence, we propose an HVS-inspired signal degradation network for JND estimation. To achieve this, we carefully analyze the HVS perceptual process in JND subjective viewing to obtain relevant insights, and then design an HVS-inspired signal degradation (HVS-SD) network to represent the signal degradation in the HVS. On the one hand, the well learnt HVS-SD enables us to assess the JND in the perceptual domain. On the other hand, it provides more accurate prior information for better guiding JND generation. Additionally, considering the requirement that reasonable JND should not lead to visual attention shifting, a visual attention loss is proposed to control JND generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the SOTA performance for accurately estimating the redundancy of the HVS.

Aesthetic experience arises from the aggregation of underlying visual components. However, most existing deep image aesthetic assessment (IAA) methods over-simplify the IAA process by failing to model image aesthetics with clearly-defined visual components as building blocks. As a result, the connection between resulting aesthetic predictions and underlying visual components is mostly invisible and hard to be explicitly controlled, which limits the model in both performance and interpretability. This work aims to model image aesthetics from the level of visual components. Specifically, object-level regions detected by a generic object detector are defined as visual components, namely object-level visual components (OVCs). Then generic features representing OVCs are aggregated for the aesthetic prediction based upon proposed object-level and graph attention mechanisms, which dynamically determines the importance of individual OVCs and relevance between OVC pairs, respectively. Experimental results confirm the superiority of our framework over previous relevant methods in terms of SRCC and PLCC on the aesthetic rating distribution prediction. Besides, quantitative analysis is done towards model interpretation by observing how OVCs contribute to aesthetic predictions, whose results are found to be supported by psychology on aesthetics and photography rules.

Contemporary supervised opinion-driven VQA strategies predominantly hinge on training from expensive human annotations for quality scores, which limited the scale and distribution of VQA datasets and consequently led to unsatisfactory generalization capacity of methods driven by these data. On the other hand, although several handcrafted zero-shot quality indices do not require training from human opinions, they are unable to account for the semantics of videos, rendering them ineffective in comprehending complex authentic distortions (e.g., white balance, exposure) and assessing the quality of semantic content within videos. To address these challenges, we introduce the text-prompted Semantic Affinity Quality Index (SAQI) and its localized version (SAQI-Local) using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to ascertain the affinity between textual prompts and visual features, facilitating a comprehensive examination of semantic quality concerns without the reliance on human quality annotations. By amalgamating SAQI with existing low-level metrics, we propose the unified Blind Video Quality Index (BVQI) and its improved version, BVQI-Local, which demonstrates unprecedented performance, surpassing existing zero-shot indices by at least 24\\% on all datasets.

To understand how these two perspectives affect overall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we conduct a large-scale subjective study to collect human quality opinions on overall quality of videos as well as perceptions from aesthetic and technical perspectives. The collected Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k) confirms that human quality opinions on UGC videos are universally and inevitably affected by both aesthetic and technical perspectives.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view clustering network to address these problems, called Global and Cross-view Feature Aggregation for Multi-View Clustering (GCFAggMVC). Specifically, the consensus data presentation from multiple views is obtained via cross-sample and cross-view feature aggregation, which fully explores the complementary of similar samples.

These visual data are not only used for human viewing or understanding but also for machine analysis or decision-making, e.g., intelligent surveillance, automated vehicles, and many other smart city applications. To this end, a new image codec paradigm for both human and machine uses is proposed in this work. Firstly, the high-level instance segmentation map and the low-level signal features are extracted with neural networks. Then, the instance segmentation map is further represented as a profile with the proposed 16-bit gray-scale representation. After that, both 16-bit gray-scale profile and signal features are encoded with a lossless codec. Meanwhile, an image predictor is designed and trained to achieve the general-quality image reconstruction with the 16-bit gray-scale profile and signal features.

With such designs, on the one hand, we can achieve scalable image compression to meet the requirements of different human consumption; on the other hand, we can directly achieve several machine vision tasks at the decoder side with the decoded 16-bit gray-scale profile, e.g., object classification, detection, and segmentation.

As a result, many researchers are inclined towards utilizing projection-based 3DQA methods. Nevertheless, previous projection-based 3DQA methods directly extract features from multi-projections to ensure quality prediction accuracy, which calls for more resource consumption and inevitably leads to inefficiency.

In this paper, we propose a novel saliency detection model by computing the contrast between superpixels with background priors and introducing a refinement method to address the problem in existing studies. Firstly, the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) method is used to segment the input image into superpixels. Then, the feature difference is calculated between superpixels based on the color histogram. The initial saliency value of each superpixel is computed as the sum of feature differences between this superpixel and other ones in image boundary.

However, the existing video codecs are originally designed for natural visual signals, and it fails to account for the characteristics of point clouds. Thus, there are still problems in the compression of geometry information generated from the point clouds. Firstly, the distortion model in the existing rate-distortion optimization (RDO) is not consistent with the geometry quality assessment metrics. Secondly, the prediction methods in video codecs fail to account for the fact that the highest depth values of a far layer is greater than or equal to the corresponding lowest depth values of a near layer.

Secondly, the EPM-based RDO method is presented to project the existing distortion model on the plane normal and is simplified to estimate the average normal vectors of coding units (CUs).

We then measure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. b) To examine the description ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the LLDescribe dataset consisting of long expert-labelled golden low-level text descriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between outputs of MLLMs and the golden descriptions. c) Besides these two tasks, we further measure their visual quality assessment ability to align with human opinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables MLLMs to predict quantifiable quality scores, and evaluate them on various existing image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess fundamental low-level visual skills.

However, most of them adopt simple linear fusion of multi-scale features, and neglect their possibly complex relationship and interaction. In contrast, humans typically first form a global impression to locate important regions and then focus on local details in those regions.

A key component of our approach is the proposed cross-scale attention mechanism, which calculates attention maps for lower level features guided by higher level features. This mechanism emphasizes active semantic regions for low-level distortions, thereby improving performance. CFANet can be used for both Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA.

Our approach takes into account the collective influence of all layers to design a layer-adaptive pruning scheme. We discover and utilize a very important additivity property of output distortion caused by pruning weights on multiple layers. This property enables us to formulate the pruning as a combinatorial optimization problem and efficiently solve it through dynamic programming. By decomposing the problem into sub-problems, we achieve linear time complexity, making our optimization algorithm fast and feasible to run on CPUs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves remarkable improvements, outperforming others by up to 1.0% for ResNet-32, 0.5% for VGG-16, and 0.7% for DenseNet-121 in terms of top-1 accuracy. On ImageNet, we achieve up to 4.7% and 4.6% higher top-1 accuracy compared to other methods for VGG-16 and ResNet-50, respectively.

However, previous methods focus mainly on improving the detection accuracy while neglecting the cost in memory and computation, which may hinder their real-world applications. In this article, we propose a novel lightweight ORSI-SOD solution, named CorrNet, to address these issues. In CorrNet, we first lighten the backbone (VGG-16) and build a lightweight subnet for feature extraction. Then, following the coarse-tofine strategy, we generate an initial coarse saliency map from high-level semantic features in a correlation module (CorrM). The coarse saliency map serves as the location guidance for lowlevel features. In CorrM, we mine the object location information between high-level semantic features through the cross-layer correlation operation. Finally, based on low-level detailed features, we refine the coarse saliency map in the refinement subnet equipped with dense lightweight refinement blocks (DLRBs) and produce the final fine saliency map. By reducing the parameters and computations of each component, CorrNet ends up having only 4.09 M parameters and running with 21.09 G FLOPs. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our lightweight CorrNet achieves competitive or even better performance compared with 26 state-of-the-art methods (including 16 large CNN-based methods and two lightweight methods), and meanwhile enjoys the clear memory and run-time efficiency.

This is because the former would require much lesser bandwidth and does not require feature extraction on the server. Existing real valued 3D feature descriptors that offer good keypoint matching performance require higher bandwidth for their transfer over the network. On the other hand, the existing binary 3D feature descriptor requires relatively less bandwidth but offers reduced keypoint matching performance. In this paper, we propose to employ lattice quantization to efficiently compress 3D feature descriptors. These compressed 3D feature descriptors can be directly matched in compressed domain without any need for decompression, hence drastically reducing the memory footprint and computational requirements. We also propose double stage lattice quantization to achieve even more compression in the case of SHOT 3D feature descriptor. We provide a spectrum of possible bit rates and achievable keypoint matching performance for three state-of-the-art 3D feature descriptors.

The reason for this incompleteness is twofold: i) insufficient network coverage and ii) data aggregation for energy saving. Whereas the existing recovery schemes only tackle the second aspect, we develop Dual-lEvel Compressed Aggregation (DECA) as a novel framework to address both aspects. Specifically, DECA allows a high fidelity recovery of a widespread event, under the situations that the WSN only sparsely covers the event area and that an in-network data aggregation is applied for traffic reduction. Exploiting both the low-rank nature of real-world events and the redundancy in sensory data, DECA combines matrix completion with a fine-tuned compressed sensing technique to conduct a dual-level reconstruction process. We demonstrate that DECA can recover a widespread event with less than 5% of the data (with respect to the dimension of the event) being collected. Performance evaluation based on both synthetic and real data sets confirms the recovery fidelity and energy efficiency of our DECA framework."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=D_S41X4AAAAJ&cstart=600&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=D_S41X4AAAAJ:04dtUmz_MT0C": {"external_link": "https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/84246", "authors": ["Weisi Lin", "Hong Ren Wu", "Lina J Karam"], "publication_date": "2012", "description": "This paper presents an overview of state-of-the-art technologies for perceptual processing of digital pictures, as well as a discussion of the issues related to their implementation, optimization and testing.

The perception and understanding of an image is modeled as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to explain the scene using an internal generative model. The psychovisual quality is thus closely related to how accurately visual sensory data can be explained by the generative model, and the upper bound of the discrepancy between the image signal and its best internal description is given by the free energy of the cognition process. Therefore, the perceptual quality of an image can be quantified using the free energy. Constructively, we develop a reduced-reference free-energy-based distortion metric (FEDM) and a no-reference free-energy-based quality metric (NFEQM). The FEDM and the NFEQM are nearly invariant to many global systematic deviations in geometry and illumination that hardly affect visual quality, for which existing image quality metrics wrongly predict severe quality degradation. Although with very limited or even without information on the reference image, the FEDM and the NFEQM are highly competitive compared with the full-reference SSIM image quality metric on images in the popular LIVE database.

Automatic saliency map determination is important in mobile video applications such as autofocusing in video capturing. It is well known that motion plays a critical role in visual attention modeling. Motion in video consists of camera's motion and foreground target's motion. In determining the visual saliency map, we are concerned with the foreground target's motion. To achieve this, we evaluate the camera/global motion and then identify the moving target from the background. Specifically, we propose a three-step procedure for visual saliency map computation: 1) motion vector (MV) field filtering, 2) background extraction and 3) contrast map computation. In the first step, the mean value of the MV field is treated as the camera's motion. As a result, the MV of the background can be detected and eliminated, and the saliency map can be roughly\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=D_S41X4AAAAJ&cstart=600&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=D_S41X4AAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4284977/", "authors": ["Guangtao Zhai", "Wenjun Zhang", "Xiaokang Yang", "Weisi Lin", "Yi Xu"], "publication_date": "2007/7/2", "conference": "2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo", "pages": "1623-1626", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "Al-Fahoum and Reza [1] characterized the blocking artifacts in block based DCT (BDCT) compressed image into five types: grid noise, staircase noise, ringing artifacts, corner outliers and the corruption of edges.

It is of great significance to design a general image restoration architecture that can work effectively on different kinds of degradation. In this paper, we propose a general image restoration architecture to exploit the global modeling capability of transformer and local modeling capability of convolutions, which integrates multi-dimensional dynamic attention and transformer into a U-Net architecture. Specifically, only CNNs are employed in the encoder-decoder, and transformers are deployed in the latent layer to fully exploit multi-scale structural differences. Furthermore, instead of learning static convolutional kernels for different inputs, the inut-independent multi-dimensional dynamic attention is designed for convolutional kernels along diverse dimensions in the encoder-decoder by cascading spatial-wise, channel-wise, and filter-wise attentions, which has the potential ability of revealing the degradation patterns. Ablation experiments indicate that it is effective that CNNs are deployed in the encoder-decoder while the transformers in the latent layer. Substantial experiments demonstrate that, compared with extensive image restoration networks, the proposed general image restoration architecture achieves superior performance with lower or comparable computational complexity on five image restoration tasks, such as image deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement.

Researches on cognitive neuroscience indicate that the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory cortex cells arise orientation selectivity in a local receptive field, within which the primary visual cortex performs visual information extraction for scene understanding. Inspired by the orientation selectivity mechanism, we compute the correlations among pixels in a local region based on the similarities of their preferred orientation. By imitating the arrangement of the excitatory/inhibitory cells, the correlations between a central pixel and its local neighbors are binarized, and the spatial correlation is represented with a set of binary values, which is named as the orientation selectivity based pattern. Then, taking both the gradient magnitude and the orientation selectivity based pattern into account, a rotation invariant structure descriptor is introduced. The proposed structure descriptor is applied in texture classification and reduced reference image quality assessment, as two different application domains to verify its generality and robustness.
