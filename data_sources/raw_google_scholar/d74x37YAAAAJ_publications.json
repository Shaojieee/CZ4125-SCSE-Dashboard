Drift is one of the challenges. We first propose a simple feedback loop complementary filter (CFF) to reduce the error caused by the integration of the gyroscope's data in the orientation estimation. Next, we propose a new and better orientation estimation algorithm which combines quaternion-based kalman filter with corrector estimates using gradient descent (KFGD).

The problem with fingerprinting approach is the high variation of RSSI values, resulting in erroneous location estimation. Machine learning approach is a new alternative to fingerprinting approach that aims to solve this problem. In this study, we adopt grid-based approach to train the Random Forest models with an end-to-end pipleline to autotune the models hyperparameter. In addition, we explore the impact of features by studying the default RSSI values for undetected AP as well as the feature importance.

Caring for elders, especially those diagnosed with dementia, can be challenging. People living with dementia (PWD) require extra care and attention from the caregivers due to the associated behaviours that come with dementia. Wandering is a frequent behaviour exhibited by PWD, which can bring about negative outcomes on the PWD as well as increasing the stress of the caregivers. Though many technological solutions exist, they are not widely deployed. This paper introduces a technological framework, bridging the localisation technologies to the needs of elders and caregivers. The aim is to minimise or eliminate the negative outcomes of dementia wandering and to reduce the burden and stress on the caregivers, thus improving overall well-being. In this paper, we study the application, SingTRACeX, features by considering user needs from the field study with 2 focus group discussions (FGD), comprising of 14 professional caregivers and coordinators. The proposed system features Real-time Location Tracking and Indoor Localisation. The location is determined by GPS location from the Sensor module when outdoors, and estimation using data from the WiFi module, and Bluetooth module when indoors. The indoor navigation provided by the Indoor Localisation module uses an A-star search algorithm.

It aims to improve the performance of the model by synthetically producing additional training samples without the need for any extra human effort.
