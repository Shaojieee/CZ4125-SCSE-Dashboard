In the last few years, deep learning has advanced radically in such a way that it can surpass human-level performance on a number of tasks. As a consequence, deep learning is being extensively used in most of the recent day-to-day applications. However, security of deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model to misclassify the output. In recent times, different types of adversaries based on their threat model leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise a deep learning system where adversaries have high incentives. Hence, it is extremely important to provide robustness to deep learning algorithms against these adversaries. However, there are only a few strong countermeasures which can be used in all types of attack scenarios to design a robust deep learning system. In this paper, we attempt to provide a detailed discussion on different types of adversarial attacks with various threat models and also elaborate the efficiency and challenges of recent countermeasures against them.", "total_citations": {"2018": 2, "2019": 36, "2020": 101, "2021": 164, "2022": 278, "2023": 216}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8232533/", "authors": ["Andreas Burg", "Anupam Chattopadhyay", "Kwok-Yan Lam"], "publication_date": "2017/12/20", "journal": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "volume": "106", "issue": "1", "pages": "38-60", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "Wireless sensors and actuators connected by the Internet-of-Things (IoT) are central to the design of advanced cyber-physical systems (CPSs).

Though these two devices are different in realworld scenarios, yet, unfortunately, a large part of research works simplifies the setting by using only a single device for both profiling and attacking. There, the portability issue is conveniently ignored to ease the experimental procedure. In parallel to the above developments, machine learning techniques are used in recent literature, demonstrating excellent performance in profiled side-channel attacks.

However, given the rise of hardware-centric security threats, we believe that EDA must also adopt related notions like secure by design and secure composition of hardware. Despite various promising studies, we argue that some aspects still require more efforts, for example: effective means for compilation of assumptions and constraints for security schemes, all the way from the system level down to the \"bare metal\"; modeling, evaluation, and consideration of security-relevant metrics; or automated and holistic synthesis of various countermeasures, without inducing negative cross-effects.In this paper, we first introduce hardware security for the EDA\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 8}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC": {"external_link": "https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1261", "authors": ["Sachin Kumar", "Jawad Haj-Yahya", "Mustafa Khairallah", "Mahmoud A Elmohr", "Anupam Chattopadhyay"], "publication_date": "2017", "journal": "Cryptology ePrint Archive", "description": "Authenticated encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) plays a significant role in cryptography because of its ability to provide integrity, confidentiality and authenticity at the same time.

Currently, a worldwide contest, titled CAESAR, is being held to decide on a set of AEAD ciphers, which are distinguished by their security, run-time performance, energy-efficiency and low area budget. For accurate evaluation of CAESAR candidates, it is of utmost importance to have independent and thorough optimization for each of the ciphers both for their corresponding hardware and software implementations. In this paper, we have carried out an evaluation of the optimized hardware implementation of AEAD ciphers selected in CAESAR third round. We specifically focus on manual optimization of the micro-architecture, evaluations for ASIC technology libraries and the effect of CAESAR APIs on the performances.

We show that Grain v1 (an eStream cipher) can be attacked with injection of only 5 faults instead of 10 that has been reported in 2012. For the first time, we have mounted the fault attack on Lizard, a very recent design and show that one requires only 5 faults to obtain the state.

It is well known since the work of Peter Shor that large scale quantum computers will threaten the security of most of the currently used public key cryptographic algorithms. This has spurred the cryptography community to design algorithms which will remain safe even with the emergence of large scale quantum computing systems. An effort in this direction is the currently ongoing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) competition, which has led to the design and analysis of many concrete cryptographic constructions. Among these, Lattice based algorithms have emerged to be promising candidates. Therefore, we focus on the efficient implementation of Ring-LWE based quantum-safe key-exchange algorithms. Further, deployment of hardware implementing such algorithms in critical applications requires security against implementation attacks. In this work, we design a side channel resistant post-quantum cryptoprocessor which supports NewHope-NIST, NewHope-USENIX and HILA5 key-exchange schemes. The implemented cryptoprocessor is highly optimized with minimal overhead due to the countermeasures. It requires about 13,500 LUTs and 8,100 FFs.

In parallel to cryptanalytic attempts, researchers have come up with many variants of RC4, some targeted to more security, some towards more throughput. We observe that the design of RC4 has been changed a lot in most of the variants. Since the RC4 structure is quite secure if the cipher is used with proper precautions, an arbitrary change in the design may lead to potential vulnerabilities, such as the distinguishing attack (Tsunoo et al., 2007) on the word-oriented variant GGHN (Gong et al., 2005). Some variants keep the RC4 structure (Maitra et al., 2008), but is byte-oriented and hence is an overkill for modern wide-word processors. In this paper, we try to combine the best of both the worlds. We keep the basic RC4 structure which guarantees reasonable security (if properly used) and we combine 4 RC4 states tacitly to design a high throughput stream cipher called {\\em Quad-RC4} that produces -bit output at every round. The storage requirement for the internal state is only  bits. In terms of speed, this cipher performs much faster than normal RC4 and is comparable with HC-128, the fastest software stream cipher amongst the eSTREAM finalists.

These attacks operate in a chosen-ciphertext setting, and are fairly generic and easy to mount on a given target, as the attacker requires very minimal information about the target device. However, these attacks have an inherent disadvantage of requiring a few thousand traces to perform full key recovery. This is due to the fact that these attacks typically work by recovering a single bit of information about the secret key per query/trace. In this respect, we propose novel parallel PC oracle based side-channel attacks, which are capable of recovering a generic P number of bits of information about the secret key in a single query/trace. We propose novel techniques to build chosen-ciphertexts so as to efficiently realize a parallel PC oracle for Kyber KEM. We also build a multi-class classifier, which is capable of realizing a practical side-channel based parallel PC oracle with very high success rate. We experimentally validated the proposed attacks (upto P= 10) on the fastest implementation of unprotected Kyber KEM in the pqm4 library. Our experiments yielded improvements in the range of 2.89\u00d7 and 7.65\u00d7 in the number of queries, compared to state-of-the-art binary PC oracle attacks, while arbitrarily higher improvements are possible for a motivated attacker, given the generic nature of the proposed attacks.

As cryptography is one of the cornerstones of secure communication among devices, the pertinence of fault attacks is becoming increasingly apparent in a setting where a device can be easily accessed in a physical manner. In particular, two recently proposed fault attacks, Statistical Ineffective Fault Attack (SIFA) and the Fault Template Attack (FTA) are shown to be formidable due to their capability to bypass the common duplication based countermeasures. Duplication based countermeasures, deployed to counter the Differential Fault Attack (DFA), work by duplicating the execution of the cipher followed by a comparison to sense the presence of any effective fault, followed by an appropriate recovery procedure. While a handful of countermeasures are proposed against SIFA, no such countermeasure is known to thwart FTA to date. In this work, we propose a novel countermeasure based on duplication, which can protect against both SIFA and FTA. The proposal is also lightweight with only a marginally additional cost over simple duplication based countermeasures. Our countermeasure further protects against all known variants of DFA, including Selmke, Heyszl, Sigl\u2019s attack from FDTC 2016.

In this article, we have incorporated intermediate qutrit approach to realize efficient implementation of all the quantum arithmetic operations mentioned above with respect to gate count and circuit-depth without T gate and ancilla.

This algorithm only returns implementation with XOR2 gates, and is deterministic. Over the last couple of years, some improvements over this algorithm has been proposed, so as to make support for XOR3 gates as well as make it randomised. In this work, we take an already existing improvement (Tan and Peyrin, TCHES'20) that allows randomised execution and extend it to support three input XOR gates. This complements the other work done in this direction (Banik et al., IWSEC'19) that also supports XOR3 gates with randomised execution.

We demonstrate using a case study on the fastest software stream cipher HC-128 in the eSTREAM final portfolio to show that the proposed design increases the performance without decreasing the security of the cipher.", "total_citations": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&cstart=200&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC": {"external_link": "https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/232", "authors": ["Kaushik Chakraborty", "Anupam Chattopadhyay", "Subhamoy Maitra"], "publication_date": "2013", "journal": "Cryptology ePrint Archive", "description": "In this paper, we present related quantum algorithms to check the order of resiliency, symmetry and linearity of a Boolean function that is available as a black-box (oracle). First we consider resiliency and show that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be immediately used for this purpose. We also point out how the quadratic improvement in query complexity can be obtained over the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for this purpose using the Grover's technique. While the worst case quantum query complexity to check the resiliency order is exponential in the number of input variables of the Boolean function, we require polynomially many measurements only. We also describe a subset of -variable Boolean functions for which the algorithm works in polynomially many steps, ie, we can achieve an exponential speed-up over best known classical algorithms. A similar kind of approach can be exploited to check whether a Boolean function is symmetric (respectively linear) or not. Given a Boolean function as an oracle, it is important to devise certain algorithms to test whether it has a specific property or it is -far from having that property. The efficiency of the algorithm is judged by the number of calls to the oracle so that one can decide, with high probability, between these two alternatives. We show that this can be achieved in  query complexity.

In the process, we identify interesting design points and explore different levels of optimizations. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of the performance figures of each design point and in each case our figures by far outperform the existing benchmarks. The best throughput achieved by the combined design is 67.84 Gbps for SOSEMANUK, 33.92 Gbps for SNOW 2.0 and 2.12 Gbps for Serpent.

BAKSHEESH runs for 35 rounds, which is 12.50 percent smaller compared to GIFT-128 (runs for 40 rounds) while maintaining the same security claims against the classical attacks. The crux of BAKSHEESH is to use a 4-bit SBox that has a non-trivial Linear Structure (LS). An SBox with one or more non-trivial LS has not been used in a cipher construction until DEFAULT (Asiacrypt'21). DEFAULT is pitched to have inherent protection against the Differential Fault Attack (DFA), thanks to its SBox having 3 non-trivial LS. BAKSHEESH, however, uses an SBox with only 1 non-trivial LS; and is a traditional cipher just like GIFT-128, with no claims against DFA. The SBox requires a low number of AND gates, making BAKSHEESH suitable for side channel countermeasures (when compared to GIFT-128) and other niche applications. Indeed, our study on the cost of the threshold implementation shows that BAKSHEESH offers a few-fold advantage over other lightweight ciphers. The design is not much deviated from its predecessor (GIFT-128), thereby allowing for easy implementation (such as fix-slicing in software). However, BAKSHEESH opts for the full-round key XOR, compared to the half-round key XOR in GIFT. Thus, when taking everything into account, we show how a cipher construction can benefit from the unique vantage point of using 1 LS SBox, by combining the state-of-the-art progress in classical cryptanalysis and protection against device-dependent attacks.

Due to its immense practical applications, there is a growing attention towards various challenges of efficient federated learning including communication efficiency, assumptions on connectivity, data heterogeneity, enhanced privacy, etc. In this paper, we address the communication efficiency of Peer-to-Peer federated learning, modeling it using a graph theoretical framework. We show that one can draw from a range of graph-based algorithms to construct an efficient communication algorithm on a connected network, thereby matching the inference efficiency of centralized federated learning as well as that of a consolidated dataset. We conduct experiments with varied graph formations and sizes to validate our claims."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3545000", "authors": ["Anindan Mondal", "Shubrojyoti Karmakar", "Mahabub Hasan Mahalat", "Suchismita Roy", "Bibhash Sen", "Anupam Chattopadhyay"], "publication_date": "2022/10/29", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems", "volume": "22", "issue": "1", "pages": "1-21", "publisher": "ACM", "description": "Hardware Trojans (HTs) are malicious manipulations of the standard functionality of an integrated circuit (IC).

Carefully crafted perturbations, imperceptible to human vision, can be added to images to force misclassification by an otherwise high performing neural network. To have a better understanding of the key contributors of such structured attacks, we searched for and studied spatially co-located patterns in the distribution of pixels in the input space. In this paper, we propose a framework for segregating and isolating regions within an input image which are particularly critical towards either classification (during inference), or adversarial vulnerability or both. We assert that during inference, the trained model looks at a specific region in the image, which we call Region of Importance (RoI); and the attacker looks at a region to alter/modify, which we call Region of Attack (RoA). The success of this approach could also be used to design a post-hoc adversarial defence method, as illustrated by our observations. This uses the notion of blocking out (we call neutralizing) that region of the image which is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks but is not important for the task of classification. We establish the theoretical setup for formalising the process of segregation, isolation and neutralization and substantiate it through empirical analysis on standard benchmarking datasets.

Their use in security-critical tasks calls for a holistic approach to SoC design, including security as a first-class architecture constraint, rather than adding security only as an afterthought. The problem is compounded by the inclusion of multiple, potentially untrusted, third party components in the SoC design. To address this challenge systematically, this paper explores four distinct and important aspects of designing secure SoCs. First, starting at the component level, an evaluation framework for assessing component security against physical attacks is proposed. Second, a scalable simulation framework is developed to integrate these secure components which offers flexibility for early- and late-stage SoC development.

The current genetic techniques for authentication are time-consuming and require specific documentary standard and laboratory protocols. Given the fact that whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data are readily available, read depth (RD)-based computational analyses has allowed the estimation of genetic profiles of cell lines. Results We propose WGS-derived aneuploidy profiling as a prototype of digital karyotyping for authentication of cancer cell lines. Here, we describe a Python-based software AStra for de novo estimation of the genome-wide aneuploidy profile, the copy number of every genomic loci, from raw WGS reads. We demonstrated that aneuploidy profile offers a unique signature that can distinguish the clonal variants (strains) of a cell line. We evaluated our approach using simulated data and variety of cancer cell lines. We further showed that cell lines exhibit distinct aneuploidy patterns which corroborate well with the experimental observations. Conclusions AStra is a simple, user-friendly, and free tool that provides the elementary information about the chromosomal aneuploidy for cell line authentication. AStra provides an analytical and visualization platform for rapid and easy comparison between different cell lines/strains.

In such situations, accurate aneuploidy profiling of cancer data is critical for calibration of copy number (CN)-detection tools. Additionally, cancer cell populations suffer from different levels of clonal heterogeneity and aneuploidy alterations over time. The degree of heterogeneity adversely affects the segregation of the depth of coverage (DOC) signal into integral CN states. This, in turn, strongly influences the reliability of this data for ploidy profiling and copy number variation (CNV) analysis.ResultsWe developed AStra framework for aneuploidy profiling of cancer data and assessing their suitability for copy number analysis without any prior knowledge of the input sequencing data. AStra estimates the best-fit aneuploidy profile as the spectrum with most genomic segments around integral CN states. We employ this spectrum to extract the CN-associated features such as the homogeneity score (HS), whole-genome ploidy level, and CN correction factor. The HS measures the percentage of genomic regions around CN states. It is used as a reliability assessment of sequencing data for downstream aneuploidy profiling and CNV analysis. We evaluated the accuracy of AStra using 31 low-coverage datasets from 20 cancer cell lines. AStra successfully identified the aneuploidy spectrum of complex cell lines with HS greater than 75%.

Thus, depending on the type of serpentine mineral present and deformation mechanisms observed, paleo deformational conditions of a particular region can be discerned.Rakhabdev lineament, is a NW-SE trending belt belonging to Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup in north-western part of India (Roy et. al., 1988), primarily exposed around Rakhabdev and Kherwara in South eastern Rajasthan. This belt lies along the boundary between shelf facies (in eastern part) and deep-water facies (in the western part)(Roy et al., 1988; Gupta et al., 1997). There is a considerable debate over the evolution mechanism of the ultramafic rocks of this belt. One view suggested that the ultramafic rocks are component of dismembered ophiolite sequence (Gupta et al., 1997, Sinha-Roy 1985) while other describes them as concordantly emplaced intrusions along the litho-contacts before and during first phase folding of the Aravalli Supergroup (Roy et al., 1988; Roy and Jakhar, 2002; Sharma, et al., 1988).

The aim of the research study was to enhance students' learning experience and improve their understanding in the threshold concepts of product design, manufacturing and assembly. As a measure to promote active learning, an educational game was introduced in the problem-solving phase of PF. A 3D puzzle game titled \u201cManufactory\u201d was designed, developed and implemented to assist students in improving their 3D spatial abilities. In order to test the presented framework, an experiment was conducted where students were allocated to either a Productive Failure (PF) or Direct Learning (DL) group. For the PF group, students were first required to solve problems in the puzzle game independently during the problemsolving phase, before instructions were given in the second delayed instruction phase. A conventional teaching approach was conducted for the DL group. Results from the experiment reflected that students in the PF group achieved a distinctive improvement, raising their average score by 40 percent and outperforming students in the DL group with 22 percent greater progression during the post-test.

"description": "When VLSI-SoC 2021 was proposed at first to the IFIP steering committee, we intended it to be an exciting in-person event to be held in Singapore. The overshadow of covid-19 disrupted that plan, forcing us to adopt a virtual conferencing model. Despite that, we are extremely glad to have organised the conference with high quality technical program, engaging invited talks and vibrant participation from the research and industrial community working in the domain of VLSI. This would not have been possible without the support of the Technical Program Committee (TPC), most importantly, our TPC chairs, Dr. Chang Chip Hong, and Dr. Victor Grimblatt. The support of IFIP steering committee throughout the organisation phase has been vital. Various active roles were played by different committee members, from inviting excellent special session papers, ensuring high quality PhD forum submissions, managing\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC": {"external_link": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/vlsid/2022/850500z028/1GFayJMxfZC", "authors": ["Aatmesh Shrivastava", "Abhishek Acharya", "SVNIT Surat", "Abir Mondal", "NIT Arunachal Pradesh", "Adit Singh", "Aditya Dalakoti", "AG Continental", "Ahmed Hemani", "KTH Sweden", "Ajay Goyal", "Infineon India", "Alok Prakash", "Amit Sharma", "Marvell Semiconductors", "Anand Raghunathan", "Ankesh Jain", "Ansuman Banerjee", "Anuj Pathania", "Anup Das", "Anup Dandapat", "Anupam Chattopadhyay", "Archisman Ghosh", "Arnab Raha", "Arun Kanuparthi", "Arvind Shrivastav", "Synapse Ashish Jindal", "DRDO Ashish Ranjan", "NIT Manipur", "Ashok Ray", "NERIST Ashutosh Yadav", "SCL ISRO", "NS Aswathy", "Baibhab Chatterjee", "Bapi Kar", "Debabrata Senapati", "Debayan Das", "Debdeep Mukhopadhyay", "Deepak Joshi", "Deliang Fan", "Dheeraj Kumar Sinha", "IIIT Bhagalpur", "Dong-Hyun Seo", "Francesco Regazzoni", "Gaurav Kumar", "Gayathri Ananthanarayanan", "IIT Dharwad", "Harshal Nemade", "Hemangee Kapoor", "Jeyavijayan Rajendran", "Jie Yang", "John Jose", "Joycee Mekie", "Kanad Basu", "Krishna Teja Malladi", "Samsung Semiconductor", "Krishna Baishnab", "Mahima Arrawatia", "Marshnil Dave", "Lion Semiconductor", "Mohamed M Sabry Aly", "Nagesh Tamarapalli", "AMD Neha Sharan", "Nirmoy Modak", "Parikha Mehrotra", "Pinalkumar Enginee", "P Surat Piyoosh", "CET Preet Yadav", "Preeti Ranjan Panda", "Priyadarshini Panda", "Qadeer Khan", "Rajesh Devaraj", "Sai Manoj", "Samah Saeed", "Sandeep Chandran", "IIT Palakkad", "Sangeet Saha", "Sanjay Moulik", "Sarada Krithivasan", "NERIST Sarfraz Hussain", "Arunachal Pradesh", "Shahar Kvatinsky", "Shovan Maity", "Qualcomm Shubhankar Majumdar", "Srivatsa Rangachar Srinivasa", "Subhadip Kundu", "Qualcomm Subhanshu Gupta", "Sudeep Pasricha", "Sudip Roy", "Sujay Deb", "Sushanta Bordoloi", "NIT Mizoram"], "description": "Technical Program Committee Members Page 1 Technical Program Committee Members \nVLSID & ES 2022 Aatmesh Shrivastava, Northeastern University Abdel Alonso, Tech Idea Co., \nLtd.

We propose efficient strategies to construct chosen ciphertexts to instantiate the aforementioned oracles to perform full key recovery. We perform experimental validation of our attacks on the optimized implementation of Streamlined NTRU Prime obtained from the pqm4 public library, a testing and benchmarking framework for post quantum cryptographic schemes on the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. We positively confirm that both the PC and DF oracle-based attacks result in full key recovery in a few thousand traces with 100% success rate. We also perform a brief survey of the various side-channel assisted chosen-ciphertext attacks on LWE/LWR-based schemes and subsequently identify critical similarities and differences between our proposed attacks as well as known attacks on the LWE/LWR-based schemes. Based on preliminary results from our proposed attacks, we do not observe any considerable increase in the attacker\u2019s effort to defeat both LWE/LWR-based schemes as well as NTRU-based schemes by a side-channel attacker in a chosen-ciphertext setting."}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=TIt4ggwAAAAJ&cstart=300&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=TIt4ggwAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC": {"external_link": "https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/pub/FlexWatts-HybridPowerDeliveryNetwork_micro20-lightning-talk.pdf", "authors": ["Mohammed Alser1 Jeremie S Kim Lois", "Orosa1 Efraim Rotem", "Avi Mendelson", "Anupam Chattopadhyay", "Onur Mutlu"], "description": "FlexWatts: A Power- and Workload-Aware Hybrid Power Delivery Network for Energy-Efficient \nMicroprocessors Page 1 Jawad Haj-Yahya1 Mohammed Alser1 Jeremie S.

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed techniques compromising the Quality-of-Service (QoS) across all design abstractions. Performing reliability-QoS trade-off from a high-level design abstraction is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose an analytical reliability evaluation framework, based on probabilistic error masking matrices (PeMMs). The reliability evaluation is performed by propagating erroneous tokens through an abstract circuit model. We report detailed experiments using a RISC processor and several embedded applications.

This is a challenging field, requiring expertise from diverse domains, ranging from mathematics to solid-state circuit design.This year we received 34 submissions from 11 different countries. The submissions were evaluated based on their significance, novelty, technical quality, and relevance to the SPACE conference. The submissions were reviewed in a double-blind mode by at least three members of the 36-member Program Committee. The Program Committee was aided by 22 additional reviewers. The Program Committee meetings were held electronically, with intensive discussions. After an\u00a0\u2026"}}
