However, the use of these technologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service disruptions. In this paper, we study false data injection (FDI) attacks against railways' traction power systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor measurements - which we call efficiency attack and safety attack -- that (i) maximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local voltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To counteract, we develop a global attack detection (GAD) system that serializes a bad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection system can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current measurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS, attack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system features an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative rates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive simulations driven by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS setup is vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false positive rate.", "total_citations": {"2020": 1}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=co5MGPkAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=co5MGPkAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7944803/", "authors": ["Sreejaya Viswanathan", "Yang Li", "Rui Tan"], "publication_date": "2017/4/18", "conference": "2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)", "pages": "269-270", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "The continuous fluctuation of electric network frequency (ENF) presents a fingerprint indicative of time, which we call natural timestamp.

However, disconnected customers may suffer discomfort and even endangerment. With the emergence of demand response involving cyber-enabled smart meters and appliances, customers can participate in coping with the imbalance by curtailing their demands, such that the impact of temporary undersupply will be more bearable and fair to customers. However, relying purely on the uncertain demand response, which is affected by variable quality of smart devices and commitment of customers, must largely weaken the assurance for grid safety. This paper proposes a two-phase load management scheme that encourages the customers to curtail their demands to mitigate the increasing tension of undersupply when there are no immediate safety concerns, and falls back to load shedding to ensure safety when the grid is drifting to a vulnerable state. Extensive simulations based on a 37-bus system and real load data traces demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme.

However, many existing fusion schemes do not consider the quality of each fusion input and may suffer from adverse conditions on one or more sensors.

UMoE uses individual expert network to process each sensor's detection result together with encoded uncertainty. Then, the expert networks' outputs are analyzed by a gating network to determine the fusion weights. The proposed UMoE module can be integrated into any proposal fusion pipeline.

Manually calibrating the CFD model parameters is tedious and labor-intensive. Existing automatic calibration approaches apply heuristics to search the model configurations. However, each search step requires a long-lasting process of repeatedly solving the CFD model, rendering them impractical especially for complex CFD models. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that calibrates a CFD model by iterating four steps of i) training a neural surrogate model, ii) finding the optimal parameters through neural surrogate retraining, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD\u00a0\u2026"}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=co5MGPkAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=co5MGPkAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C": {"external_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3549076", "authors": ["Wenjie Luo", "Zhenyu Yan", "Qun Song", "Rui Tan"], "publication_date": "2022/12/8", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks", "volume": "19", "issue": "1", "pages": "1-30", "publisher": "ACM", "description": "Runtime domain shifts from the training phase caused by sensor characteristic variation incur performance drops of the deep learning-based sensing systems.

In displaying DTs, Holographic-Type Communication (HTC), which supports the transmission of holographic data such as Light Field (LF), can provide an immersive way for users to interact with Holographic DTs (HDT). However, it is challenging to effectively allocate interactive and resource-intensive HDT services among HDT users and providers. This paper integrates the paradigms of HTC and DT to form a HTC for DT system, designs a marketplace for HDT services where HDT users' and providers' prices are evaluated by their valuation functions, and proposes an auction-based mechanism to match HDT services using a learning-based Double Dutch Auction (DDA). Specifically, we apply DDA and train an agent acting as the auctioneer to adjust the auction clock dynamically using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to achieve the best market efficiency.

Thus, supporting distinct temperature setpoints is desirable for a co-location data center in pursuing higher energy efficiency.
