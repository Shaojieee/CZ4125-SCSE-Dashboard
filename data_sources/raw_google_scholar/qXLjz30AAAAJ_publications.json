The main reason is that the sensor nodes located near a base station have to relay data for a large part of the network and thus deplete their batteries very quickly. The solution we propose in this paper suggests that the base station be mobile; in this way, the nodes located close to it change over time. Data collection protocols can then be optimized by taking both base station mobility and multi-hop routing into account.

The more practical single AP localization is largely left as an open problem because the hardware-induced time delay \u201ccontaminates\u201d the measurement of signal propagation time in the air. In this article, we design and implement M 3  to tackle this challenge with commodity Wi-Fi cards. M 3  exploits a multipath-assisted approach that turns the harmful multipath from foe to friend to enable single AP localization: a device can be pinpointed through the combination of azimuths and the relative time of flight (ToF) of Line-of-Sight (LoS) signal and reflection signals, eliminating the need for multiple APs along with their absolute ToF\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": {"2020": 3, "2021": 15, "2022": 28, "2023": 17}}, "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=qXLjz30AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=qXLjz30AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC": {"external_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7524511/", "authors": ["Jie Hao", "Yanbing Yang", "Jun Luo"], "publication_date": "2016/4/10", "conference": "IEEE INFOCOM 2016-The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications", "pages": "1-9", "publisher": "IEEE", "description": "Although Visible Light Communication (VLC) is gaining increasing attentions in research, developing a practical VLC system to harness its immediate benefits using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices is still an open issue.

In this paper, we investigate various opportunities of using a high-order modulation to boost the throughput of LED-Camera VLC systems, and we decide that Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK) is the most suitable scheme given the limited operating frequency of such systems. However, directly driving an LED to emit different levels of luminance may suffer heavy distortions caused by the nonlinear behavior of LED.

Consequently, we proposed Adv-4-Adv as a novel adversarial training method that aims to retain robustness against unseen adversarial perturbations.
